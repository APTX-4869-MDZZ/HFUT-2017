can be different from an individual to another one?Again the \u0091\u0092strength\u0092\u0092 of a biomarker depends very much on the context.On this paper strip there are also complementary aptamers which recognize a different epitope of the biomarker.They are put in excess for the detection, so even if there is the target in the sample to be analyzed, some beads are going to migrate to the control band.How to fix aptamers on the paper strip?Most biomarkers are not stand-alone diagnostics/prognostics but are used in the context of decision-making pipelines, for example based on IHC, CT scans, \u0085Overall, are the best biomarkers for a specific disease concentrated in a particular body fluid (blood, urine, etc) ?Basically, aptamers are biotinylated, they bind to the Streptavidin part, which is fixed onto cellulose thanks to the cellulose binding domains.Another important aspect of the project was the design of a real device.Some researchers, and particularly Dr. Ciara O\u0092Sullivan, brought us to the idea of using nanoparticles covalently linked to the aptamers.If the target is present in the sample, it will be taken in sandwich between the aptamers on the beads and the fixed aptamers.However, this is currently at the research stage.Biomarkers detection is a field largely explored both by iGEM teams and industrials.Three kinds of BioBricks were constructed and sent to the registry to build our detection device: target generators (protein subunits of the HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase and HBsAg, biomarker of Hepatitis B, deposited parts BBa_K1934060 and BBa_K1934061) anchor allowing the fixation of the aptamer to the paper: our biological detection system needs to be anchored on paper.Moreover, after a risky behavior, the question is: \u0093am I infected with a STI?\u0094.If one wants to sell a detection platform, it must not only be the biological part, but also a real device to pack it.So we could imagine to sell the device and paper strips to be put inside the casing as a platform to be adapted with aptamers for each situations.So after the detection band there is also a control band made with complementary strands of the DNA on the beads.If the target is not present, beads will be unable to form this sandwich and won t be stopped.--> This depends very much on the disease.So please think carefully what you want to achieve with your biomarker and what the follow up would be.Is there a large diversity of biomarkers for a specific disease?Which characteristics/properties do you require in order to consider a biomarker as a \u0093good\u0094 one?A visible black band will progressively appear, due to the beads\u0092 coloration.I believe that infectious diseases are fairly \u0091\u0092easy\u0092\u0092 to diagnose, since the infectious agent expresses proteins that are usually not present in the host organism.Aptamers were not used at all in the labs of our school, but we learned they existed by reading literature.They also have the advantage to be easily chemically modifiable.This is very much different for multifactorial disease that affect the wider population and that have lifestyle factors, environmental factors interacting with the organism and its inherent genetic make-up, physiology etc.Developing antibodies-based tests has some drawbacks: lengthy and pricey process of identification and production, short shelf-life\u0085 innovations are needed to develop more frugal tests.Our main innovation relies on the use of aptamers technology.Very early in the project we have decided to build a detection device.After some tests, we were a little disappointed, so we went to an international congress about Aptamers in Bordeaux (France).To give an example, if you were to screen 10 million people for a disease and you had 1% false positives (99% specificity) this would still mean 100,000 false positives.Compared to antibodies, the processes of selection and production of aptamers are quicker, easier, and cheaper.It\u0092s a cornerstone for our project, because that\u0092s what people are going to see and use.A first aptamer is covalently linked to the latex beads.That brought us to the idea of using fluorescence.That\u0092s a much more eco-friendly option, plus on a large scale it\u0092s less expensive.Our major motivation was to provide the world with a good solution to detect STIs.--> We mainly use LC-MS/MS with a lot of bioinformatics and statistics behind to try and find significant differences between different sets of samples.CSF) but especially urine levels may be very variable depending on how it was collected and on the metabolic state of the person.There is a trend towards so-called extracellular vesicles that circulate in blood for cancer-derived biomarkers, since cancer cells have a more rapid turnover and tend to shed such vesicles (e.g.Here are the different topics we talked about during the interview.How would you define a \u0093good\u0094 biomarker?After adding the sample onto the beads, they migrate on a paper strip.cardiovascular disease, COPD) and a trend is going towards \u0091\u0092biomarker panels\u0092\u0092.We had the opportunity to talk about biomarkers with Prof. Rainer Bischoff, a dutch biomarker expert.We immediately found out it was a promising technology.They developed a Streptavidin linked to a Cellulose binding domain, fusion protein.A biomarker may also be found in urine or another body fluid (e.g.We took this idea and pushed it a little further, characterizing their part and building new and more efficient ones.A first model was designed as a prototype to test our paper strips.Or is it possible to find them in various body fluids?--> I think that blood-based body fluids are most widely used in practice, because they are easily obtained.It is highly unlikely to find single, specific biomarkers for such diseases (e.g.So we hope some future iGEM teams will follow us on this exciting path!", "design": "Making a linear device, with all the diseases having a result really close to one another was our first option.But we quickly thought it was not a good solution, because it could lead to misinterpretations.The little needle hidden in the device does not refer to a syringe, so the object is less \u0093threatening\u0094 than what\u0092s on the market.What benefits came out of this experience with design?After a phase of design with sketches and first shape choices, the chosen shape was modelized in 3D printing.Design could be a fabulous communication tool to get people\u0092s acceptance on using synthetic biology based productsWhat are the motivations to get involved in an iGEM project?E.Design was a key concept in the evolution of our project.As our final test was designed to detect several diseases at a time, we needed a shape that could allow an unambiguous reading of the results.This phase was tricky and we had to adjust the design a lot, because the 3D visualization allowed us to see what was working and what was not\u0085 So details were corrected, the functionality of the device was improved and changed.Here are some details about the choices that have led to the design of our device.A great amount of work was done and we have managed to end up with a final product ready to be put on the market.If the device is intuitive enough people should be able to use it without reading the instructions: it\u0092s the main goal of each functional device.We think the end-user may be able to make the test with a quick look at the instructions.Our goal is to sell the self-test at a low price.We used a lot of 3D printing to be able to get our hands on the device and see what needed to be modified.Sadly, it is rare to have a product designer working in parallel to the development of a new product.But with the results we got, we really think it could be a very good investment to pursue the development of such a test.The final model or our device, printed at a 3.5:1 scale for demonstration purposes.Each tested disease will have its name on a label above each detection pad, to ensure correct interpretation of the results.chromi, developed by the 2009 iGEM Cambridge team, is an inspiring design project.The circular design seemed to be better suited for the end-user, so we kept it as the final design.Putting color on the surfaces that are going to be manipulated is a way to guide the user.That\u0092s why I joined the INSA Lyon team.\u0094Design makes you think about the end-user first.So the device could be really less expensive.Scientists try to solve specific problems, but designers tend to think at a larger scale, they also think about the environment in which the product may be used.Design should be an integrated practice!First, we had to define a list of specifications we wanted for our device.The work of Neri Oxman from MIT and Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg from Cambridge was a great source of inspiration to understand how design and synthetic biology could be integrated together in a project.Moreover, the round shape is less appalling, because it does not evoke a medical device.The design itself includes two major functional parts, colored surfaces on the picture.iGEM is a very unique opportunity to make applied design.First, we made a list of all the technical specifications we wanted for our device to become a functional prototype.Of course, one single droplet is not enough to have a correct fluid migration into the device.It was important for us to integrate an eco-friendly approach in the making of the device.Most French laboratories do not take design into account, although it could be a very useful tool to communicate and come up with new solutions.To go further, I wanted to work on a design project including bacteria.A 3D-printed model was made and evolved progressively with the team\u0092s remarks.The very first sketches we drew.Although this phase can take quite some time, we were able to figure out something rather quickly, thanks to the very precise technical specifications we had laid down in the beginning.The product must be easy to use by the end-user.The existing HIV test is quite complex, with eight elements to be manipulated by the user.Therefore, a small bottle of buffer is provided, for the user to fill up the central reservoir in order to dilute the sample.Making liquids migrate correctly on the paper band inside the prototype was not an easy task.So the round shape, with all diseases detected on different pads turned out to be far better.It was the most important part of the work.That is why we decided to put color on the zones that should the user should get in direct contact with and leave the rest in white.Once the choice was made, we went on with 3D-printing prototypes.The shape has been designed to ensure optimal grip of the hand on the device.Then the final shape was developed, printed and tested as well.It was a very interesting part, because we could see the evolution of the ideas.The user can hold the device in one hand, press a finger against the bottom of the device to trigger a little needle hidden in the device.We pursued theses development cycles until we were satisfied with the results.Then the user puts the droplet of blood from his finger on the central round of the device.The buffer cap is on one piece and need to be put elsewhere, this is not very easy to understand at a first glance.For our project, the difficulty comes from the precise protocol that the user must follow.They managed to combine design and synthetic biology in a very inventive way.A prototype was printed and tested in the lab.The most important remark is that no self-test on the market are suited for the detection of multiple STI.Then the migration starts and the results are available within fifteen minutes.A vast majority of the public never heard of it.It\u0092s a very simple device, contrary to what\u0092s currently available.Within our team, scientists shared ideas and knowledge about synthetic biology while Jeanne, our designer, brought insight from a different point of view.The general aspect of the test is quite cold and unfriendly, dramatizing the situation.Jeanne is a good example: \u0093I was interested in biology and studied sciences when I was young.For the special case of HIV, detection is effective only three months after infection.I wrote a memoir about \u0093the loss of control on the living\u0094.We also found out through our human practices actions that potential users tend to be stressed out and uncomfortable when a STD test needs to be done.We wanted to come up with a beautiful and useful device that would be easy to use.This was our first experience dealing with an applied design.The biological detection material is put on a paper strip.The test would need to:Taking all these pieces of information into account, we started the design process itself.So this was really a collaborative work.How to design something intuitive and user-friendly?Building something new and really innovative is a difficult task, especially when you start from scratch.Of course a lot of development work would still be required to build a fully functional and reliable device.", "human_practice": "Is medical support a barrier to accessibility are a needed lock to ensure a correct use of the diagnosis test?Paper and biosourced materials : our technical choices to reduce the impact of our device on the planet.The diagnosis test as to be integrated on a sustainable perspective.Moreover, the risk of a too intensive use is sensed as a positive fact on the condition that the test has to be precise enough, well used, and associated with prevention measure (traditional diagnosis methods and protection).Nowadays, the banalization risk is clearly not a problem.A lot of the interogated people were also looking for medical support by going to a diagnosis center or to their primary care physician.So retail of the diagnosis tests has to be correlated to a good support and with some quality informations for the good use.It is necessary to deliver with the diagnosis test a special waste bag and a single-use self pricker and to collect it at drugstores.On the one hand the diagnosis test has to be usable to every people without any medical skills or knowledges.Consequently, it confirmed the relevance of our decision to go outside the lab and meet professionals.During the analysis of the matrix we highlighted 4 groups of words: 1 - INNOVATION: early detection, short time for results, low cost 3 - RISKS: banalization, biosafety, reliability , use decay 4 - RESPONSIBILITY : support, cycle of life,easy to use, accessibilityThe analysis consisted in confronting these four statements to the following principles: Respect of the human dignity, rights and fundamental freedoms Civil responsibility of the engineer and individual responsibilityThe early stage of the infection is a high risk transmission stage.Easy access is the key to ensure the largest use of the diagnosis test so it has to offer good condition : privacy and informations when buying it.Outside the hospital, the prescription of a diagnosis test has be realized with the verbal agreements of the consultant.This condition is necessary to the test democratization: the right of the people to have an access to a diagnosis test.The priority is to give an access to a fast, easy and reliable test to everyone, in order to know its serologic profile.Using non pathogen biological materials for the test is obvious: a diagnostic test should not be hazardous for the user.It implies precautions taking by the healthcare authority in numerous domains: informations, medical or para medical support, juridical protection, free access, evaluation, accessibility limited to drugstore?Use on animals, use as a contraceptive tools,... Is it the responsibility of developers and/or retailers to assume the use decays of its device?The Ethical Matrix: A lot of questions about the project Simplicity of use, rapidity of realization, early diagnosis detection, low cost and autonomous use.Is anonymity essential or optional during the diagnosis process?To study privacy concerns, it s necessary to distinguish the body from the mind.The test has to preserve the integrity of the user s body.Using blood as sample is an appropriate way to protect the integrity of the user it is considered as a non-invasive test.In case of a false negative test or non persuaded positive person, the risk of transmission for the HIV will be increased and the person will be extremely contagious.In such cases, it can be interesting to compare the issues with other diagnosis test like pregnancy tests or the genetics test.The diagnosis test reconfigure the relationships between the medical staff and the users.No matter how the rapid diagnostic test can be reliable, results have to be confirmed.The test has to be persuasive enough to condition the user s reaction and the decision after the results.There are two risks for a diagnostic test: the false positive and the false negative.For some people, going at the hospital or a the free diagnosis center is mentally difficult.During a test can we risk to get contaminated by HIV protein whereas the test has vocation to prevention and detection?About the respect of others: precautions are essential about the management and the treatments of the blood-contaminated wastes.For instance, OraQuick\u00ae is recognize by FDA but didn t receive the CE agreement.This test presents a paradox between two aspects: on the one hand the isolation of the user and on the other hand the user confronted to someone of the medical staff or from an association who can provide support to the user in his diagnosis process.How our test calls questions the relationship between the medical staff and the user?Here is some other choices to reduce the impact of the diagnosis test on the environment.What about the medical confidentiality, which is the root of the trust of the patient to his doctor or the principle of helping person confronted to a danger (in the case of a doctor who knows that a patient risks to transmit the HIV to his partner who ignore the seropositivity)?How to protect the privacy of the user?So the altruist dimension takes all of its meaning because the test give the opportunity of an early diagnosis which contributes to relieve the suffering of the patient, to greatly increase the life expectancy and guarantee decent life conditions.Reinforcing the accessibility of the diagnosis test is encouraging the voluntary approach to get diagnosticate.Reinforcing the accessibility of the diagnosis test is encouraging the voluntary approach to get diagnosticate.economic issue (the price of production and purification) and ethical issues : even if it is produced by bacteria, is it correct to use some viral protein on the test ?Is a medical support needed?The accompaniment question contains three aspects.Indeed free test is the number one reason for women to go to an diagnosis center in France.), economic issues (the price of production and purification) and ethical issues: even if it is produced by bacteria, is it correct to use some viral protein on the test?In the case of an self-test, the user has the choice to be alone with the diagnosis device and will face the results alone.The reaction of the user with his test is unknown.The presence of a such protein in the test has been rejected due to technical issue (what about the risks of false positive due to background noise?)Indeed, the primo infection is a high viral charge and high transmission risk period.How to manage the interaction between the device and protect the free will and the dignity of the user?For HIV, the early stage of infection corresponds to a high transmission rate period.Used as a tool to make ethical decisions, the matrix improved our project according to 4 directions: Innovation, Perception, Risk management, Responsibility.or be used as a contraceptive tools (the early detection can be sensed as security) or as an incomplete prevention tool before an unprotected practice.According to a technical point of view, the rapidity preserves the test from any other external contamination which may interfere with the binding reaction or from inadequate environmental conditions.How can we manage to reduce the loneliness of the user concerning the test and the results self interpretation ?The case of the plastic device will be explained in section 4.A diagnostic test is characterized by two risks: the false positive and the false negative which has to be strictly negative!The interviewed doctors do not sense banalization (the risk of a too frequent use after a risk taking) like a detrimental consequence of high accessibility.In the long run, the model of the retail of diagnosis tests will probably converge to a pregnancy tests like model.Integrated sustainable development to synthetic biology.The design of the user note has to bring some answers.Is it acceptable for the user to prepare himself to receive the results and read the user instructions with attention?For instance the AIDS diagnosis implies the prognostic medical of the patient and its future on familial, professional and social points of view.Sometimes the relatives don\u0092t have the knowledge and the pedagogy quality of a health professional.What are the consequences of the early detection on the user?Can anonymity be guaranteed during the whole diagnosis process?In the other case it\u0092s affecting the life of the person on a negative way.Protection of the future generation: Early diagnosis on pregnant women can reduce the transmission risk to the new born child.The diagnosis announcement is delivered by the doctor which accompany the patient.However, the use of such a test present some hard ethical requirements in matter of engineer civil responsibilities and protection of the human integrity.However, the use of such a test presents some hard ethical requirements in regards of the engineer s civil responsibilities and protection of the human integrity.It is possible only with the agreement of the patient in case of therapeutic emergency and it is supposed to improve the diagnosis process and the beginning of the therapy.Examples of a decision taken thanks to the matrix : Reliability: a system that minimize the false negative risk by using to epitopes instead of one Biosafety: latex beads instead of RT proteins or HbSAg as migration controlsThe familial accompaniment has also consequences on the user.According to the diversity of patient sensitivity and thoughts path to the acceptation of the diseases, a psycholog can be required and also a social assistant to ensure the administrative procedure.(lien vers) The answers show that an accompaniment is needed mainly during the test execution and during the results interpretation.The easy access is the number one reason according to the men which go to free diagnosis center.Furthermore, an accompaniment has to be provided (like condoms) because of the incompatibility of the self service and the informational procedure delivered by the medical staff.Our ethical advisors suggested that we work on an ethical matrix according to the work of Ben Mepham, \"The Ethical Matrix: a Framework for Teaching Ethics to Bioscience Students\".The tests aim to modify the behaviour of the users, they have to be aware about the risk of contamination after use.Furthermore, the matrix has been consulted to take a decision concerning the migration witness.Models of trashs collect can be practicable : the test can be returned to the drugstore and be centralized before being treated.On the other hand, the simplicity of use contribute to reduce the mistake due to the manipulations during the test.The accompaniment ante/post test delivered by the medical staff or associative members.STDs are severe consequences diseases which engage the health pronostic in the long run and carry very serious secondary effects like sterility, opportunistic infections and indirectly death.In case of internet self-service, the privacy seems to be well protected, for instance thanks to the use of avatars, intermediate bank account platform and privacy policies even if the datas own can escape very easily to the users.Finally it will be pertinent to design a neutral and difficulty recognizable packing to protect the privacy of the users when buying an auto test.The personal initiative to get diagnosticate is the motor of prevention by diagnosis.It is the same specifications for the plastic device which has to be collected and recycled.Finally, The price and the norm are the two greatest barriers to the massive use of a technology all around the world.The presence of such a protein in the test was rejected due to technical issues (what about the risks of false positive due to background noise?To conclude the project conciliate technical aspects and environmental specifications.After the use the management of the biological trashed has to be investigated.According to the virologist Prof. Chidiac, the risk of false negative has to be strictly null.The question of the medical support has been asked in the survey.It implies precautions taking by the healthcare authority in numerous domains : informations, medical or para medical support, juridical protection, free access, evaluation, accessibility limited to drugstore ?In hospital, it allows to obtain the results without getting another appointment (decrease the flow in hospital, increase the number of tested people and save some time for the user).What should be the position of the medical staff?At first, we wanted to use reverse transcriptase on the detection pad.At first, we wanted to use reverse transcriptase on the detection pad.Considering the values, we chose to adapt Ben Mepham\u0092s work to our project, we wanted to have a vast panel of values to have the largest approach and to apply them to the interest of the different groups.Once the matrix was established, on the one hand, it was used as an instrument to have a human overview of the project.In case of false negative, the infected people will not be aware of its positivity and can\u0092t take the good measure to protect itself and its other partners.In case of emergency like during the delivery of pregnant women with unknown serologic profiles, the rapidity of the test allows to protect the child of any contamination.Do these specifications raise new ethical issues?In this section, we present our embedded ethics approach to work on the project and find some answers to our numerous questions about the project: the ethical matrix.Indeed STDs can survive during a long run in a liquid solution or six hours at the air.On the other hand, we confronted it with the results of the survey.This approach illustrate the expression of the free will.A call center also can be available to deliver advices to the users.We suggest to analyze the respect of the dignity, confidentiality and privacy of the user.In super market, the abundance of the people can increase the feeling of being anonymous : I\u0092m someone in the middle of the mass or at the opposite as meetings have a higher probability : How to stand the regard of someone when grabbing an autotest ?This problem can be deleted by the release in drugstore or in self service.Another interesting question about privacy and the respect of dignity studies the non-acceptance of the diagnosis by refusing to announce the situation to its private circle.The support of the paper consists in recycled cellulose.Informations about the meaning of the diseases, the treatments and the consequences has to be given objectively and with the respect of everyone s sensitivity.The accompaniment during the retail, it contains all the informations accessible to the potential user (usernote, advice of the para-medical staff, advertisement, comments on forum networks).Moreover this 15 minutes waiting time allows a supplementary dialogue between medical staff and the patient.Anonymity should not to be an obstacle to health care quality and has to be revoked until the health prognosis of the patient is threatened.So the transmission rate is greatly decreased.At the early stage of the cycle of life the biosourced materials has been privileged to reduce the rarefaction petrol and rare ore. For instance, we used latex beads which are potentially biosourced with rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) than nanoparticles of gold which is a common support to work with aptamer.The requirements to allow the american auto test OraQuick\u00ae didn t pay attention to the price in the final equation.In parallel of our scientific development to achieve the technical aspect of the project, it was necessary to consider an embedded ethics approach.In the long run, the future of the humanity is threatened.The short time for the results delivery offers numerous advantages for the all-day hospital diagnosis, for the campaign of diagnosis and for emergency-case diagnosis.The results are delivered 15 min after collecting the sample.Nevertheless, misuses under bad conditions (alcoholed-altered behaviour) or without the respect of the correct practices described in the usernote lead to erroneous diagnosis.However in both cases, it impacts the future of the both partners.In the synthesis of the matrix, we used the survey and interviews we conducted to complete the reflection.Preparing the Ethical Matrix: confronting values to interest groups To prepare this matrix we needed to establish a list of agents that can have interests in our technology including stakeholders and relevant values and principles which were implicated in our project.So, most of the device or molecules that have been recognized for their efficiency are integrally reimbursed by the French medical coverage.Is it the responsibility of the developers and/or the retailers to assume the usernote respect?Besides, the tellers do not have any medical skills and are not under medical secret.The judgement of the close relatives is influenced by the affection for the patient and their will to answer at all cost to every sollicitations.", "modeling": "The best model has a Z-score of -1.63 that means a quite good absolute quality of the prediction, the graphic shows that our model is in the standard deviation of

membrane.Figure 11: 3D structure of HBsAg with a C-terminusi His-Tag (green)Figure 12: 3D structure of HBsAg with a N-terminus His-Tag (green) We can see that the C-terminus His-Tag is near an ?-helix so it is not very accessible.The graphic below shows that the predicted structure is outside of the standard deviation of the major part of the experimental structures.Figure 3: Comparison with non-redundant set of PDB structures of Streptavidin_CBDs model (red cross)Figure 4: 3D structure of the model, CBD1 (bleu), Streptavidin (red) and CBD2 (green) Here we can see that the domains are not well defined.Then we used the software Rosetta[5], and the webservers I-TASSER[6] and RaptorX[7].Moreover, the aptamer structure modeling, coupled to the modelisation of the aptamers/target interactions allowed us to select the best aptamer to bind to HBsAg.Homology modeling of chimeric proteins with Cellulose Binding Domain As we wanted to know the 3D structure of our chimeric proteins (RFP_CBDs, Streptavidin_CBDs and Streptavidin_CipA), we used homology modeling.To validate the quality of the predicted models, we calculated the QMEAN Z-score[8], which estimates the absolute quality of a model by comparing to the structures solved by X-ray crystallography and with a resolution below than 2 \u00c5.For the RFP domain we chose 2H5Q[1], Streptavidin 4BX6[2] and for the various CBDs 4JO5[3] and 1NBC[4].As the model seemed suitable for the RFP_CBDs, we decided to work on the part designed by the 2014 iGEM Stanford-Brown-Spelman team (BBa_K1499004) and model its 3D structure.First, we ran preliminary tests with a construct similar to the chimeric protein of the 2014 iGEM Stanford-Brown-Spelman team 2014 (BBa_K1499004).So we realized a de novo modeling using the software Rosetta[9] to modelize the 3D structures of the protein with the His-Tag at both ends.Thanks to our webserver, we obtained the 3D structures of the 3 aptamers against the HBsAg.Prediction of 3D structure of the proteins allowed us to enhance the Cellulose Binding power of our constructs (RFP_CBD, Streptavidin_CipA\u0085) and to properly display the His-Tag to purify the Hepatitis B biomarker HBsAg.We used them in the docking webserver NPDock[11] to predict the interaction between the protein and the nucleic acid molecule.Figure 15: Interactions between HBsAg and its 3 aptamers We can see that aptamers A and B fix to the same domain of the protein but aptamer C is on the opposites side.First, we made the structural model of this chimeric protein to see the differences with the previous one and if it was more promising.The best model had a Z-score of -3.36, which means a bad absolute quality of the prediction.The best model has a Z-score of -1.75, which means a quite good absolute quality of the prediction.Fortunately, in the registry, the 2015 iGEM Edinburgh team made a RFP protein with another Cellulose Binding Domain, CipA (BBa_K1615100).As we didn\u0092t have the time nor the resources to run a SELEX procedure[10], we wanted to use the software MAWS developed by the 2015 iGEM Heidelberg team Heidelberg.Here, we just studied the fold of the protein in order to see if it could work.Nonetheless, we found out through our wetlab experiments that the protein was red and it fixed to the cellulose.We made a PSI-BLAST against the PDB and no structure was available for a homology modeling.For the purification of this protein, we needed to put a His-Tag, either at the N- or C-termini of the protein sequence.Because the RFP_CipA work well in the wetlab and the model is good, we decide to use a streptavidin with this CipA.Finally, we aligned models with experimental structures to check if the structure was conserved, so functions would remain unaltered.These templates were obtained by a PSI-BLAST against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the NCBI server.Sadly, we didn\u0092t succeed in cloning this part in a plasmid so we could not experiment the purification with the His-Tag at the N-terminus.The best model returned a Z-score of -0.73, which means a high absolute quality of the prediction.To develop a multi STI-sensor based on aptamers, we first needed to study the necessary biomolecules for the scaffold of the device, and then the interactions between the biomarkers and the nucleic acid sequences.Then this protein was used for the development of purification and fixation protocols on microcrystalline cellulose.Instead of streptavidin at the center of the CBDs we used RFP, like the 2015 iGEM Edinburgh team did.The N-terminus His-Tag is more accessible so we decided to put it here for the purification of HBsAg.As we have seen previously, the streptavidin with the 2 CBDs wasn\u0092t the best solution to fix the aptamer onto the paper.If the protein became red, it meant that the RFP domain was functional.Only the wetlab results could show if the protein is working or not, and if it seems functional.But this software didn\u0092t gave us the expected results because of the inconsistency in the structure of the aptamer in the PDB file result.Structure of a family 3a carbohydrate-binding module from the cellulosomal scaffoldin CipA ofClostridium thermocellumwith flanking linkers: implications for cellulosome structure.As an example, we could only find one aptamer well described in the literature to the HIV reverse transcriptase.And the results showed that this protein was more efficient about the fixation on paper.The selection was based on the identity, alignment, e-values, sequence coverage and resolution of the structure.HBsAg, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, is one of the biomarkers we want to detect in our device.Selection of HBsAg-Specific DNA Aptamers Based on Carboxylated Magnetic Nanoparticles and Their Application in the Rapid and Simple Detection of Hepatitis B Virus Infection.Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 71(1), pp.261-277.To do so, we needed appropriate templates for each domain (RFP, Streptavidin, CBDs or CipA).", "notebook": "", "protocol": "You can calculate this number using the following equation: 1 \u00b5L x concentration of DNA

in competition to bind the aptamer, the emitted fluorescence is a good estimation of the proportion of aptamers that have linked an ATP.We also tested the microfluidics of this system once in our prototype, until we got good migration results.Characterization of Aptamers for real STIs: HIV and HBV After an intensive work on the human thrombin, we tested HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase (RT).Above a certain threshold of the concentration, fluorescence is quenched.With a Kd of 330 \u00b5mol.L-1 (target concentration able to be fixed by the aptamers).Here are some of our first experiment results that guided us through our development, and finally, our results with sexually transmitted infections vectors.First study of the ATP-aptamer\u0092s affinity in liquid In this experience, we used some modified aptamers.However, on a cellulose paper sheet the fluorescence detection turned out to be much less efficient, even in the optimal conditions that ensure a minimum of quenching.Although our detection procedure requires two aptamers, and the sensitivity of the method will be limited by the worst Kd between the two aptamers.We think that the quenching oligo is disturbing the aptamer, lowering its sensitivity.Study of the impact of various solvents and blood proteins on the fluorescence emitted by fluorescein In this experience we wanted first to test what is the impact of non-isotonic solvents on the emitted fluorescence.Fluorescence was stopped by the reverse-complement of the aptamer, which was holding a quencher: a molecule that switches off the fluorescence by the Fluorescent Resonnance Energy Transfert (FRET) phenomenon.It was concluded that blood filtration to remove especially red blood cells which could mask the fluorescence is proven to be very important: the fluorescence emitted is between 2 and 11 times larger in the case of serum compared to whole blood.We did an EMSA with the most efficient HIV RT aptamer we could find.At this stage antibodies are produced by the patient\u0092s body yet, so conventional methods of detection are not valid.Then, we tried to do the same with 3 known aptamers against the HBV\u0092s surface antigen (HBsAg).The filtration pad was here to prevent erythrocytes from migrating on the paper strip.It worked, after migration the nitrocellulose remained white and the results could be read.As can be seen here, there is a good response of the system to ATP.Inspired by the work of the 2015 iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec team on sfGFP (another fluorescent molecule which emission wavelengths and absorption are to foresee a fluorescence (see below).The sensitivity was worse than in the previous EMSAs with the thrombin and the RT.Moreover, adding a filter to the lens increases the detection sensitivity.", "safety": "Waste

most hazardous compounds used: Biological experiments also require their own safety precautions.Personal safety is important in the lab to avoid injuries and contamination.The sequences were synthesized de novo by GeneCust, to avoid the manipulation of the whole HIV genome as a PCR template.They were systematically used under a fume hood, with nitrile gloves and goggles.These two genes belong to human pathogens but are not pathogenic in their isolated version.To put it in a nutshell we followed fundamental rules of biological and chemical safety in a scientific laboratory.Because we did a lot of molecular biology and complex chemical reactions we were prone to use dangerous chemicals.under a fume hood if handling hazardous chemicals).Among the parts constructed by our team, genes

class 3 viral organism.Avoiding environmental contamination with modified strains is a key aspect when working with exogenous expression plasmids and strains.We could resume basic rules as follow:  Always wash your hands and disinfect your lab bench before and after each manipulation with ethanol.Our instructors gave us important security guidelines at the beginning of the project.Always wear appropriate clothes: lab coat, closed shoes, attached hair, no hand jewels, avoid wearing contact lenses...Moreover, a construct using a gene coding for a surface protein from Hepatitis B was also

control exceeds a billion dollars.IGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015 has created TERMITE TERMINATOR, a genetically modified toxins expression system with a delivery carrier cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , capable of trapping termites based on their trophallaxis, and then kill the whole nest.We choose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites.Following the instruction, they open the outer shell, put the box of food inside, spread some water on the surface of the food, and place the device in a corner where is dark, damp and termites can be seen.But if the damage is due to termites, repairing will be only a temporary protection.The ZJUTT (ZJU TERMITE TERMINATOR) sees this problem and therefore cooperates with the ancient building protection department.As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people  houses, we can bring the result of the project into production.As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people  houses, we can bring the result of the project into production.With the monitor, precaution can be taken and use ZJUTT devices kill termites before they cause any damage.Under the dazzling sunshine of summer, students are sweating, reading their textbooks.When 3 months pass and there are nearly no termites, take out the food box form the device and burn the rest food if possible.Termites are not only in school but also in people s houses.What s more annoying is that, the termites are also coming!It really influences public safety and people\u0091s life in a negative way.Because of the photophobic habit of termites, they always move in a covert condition.They are always one of the toughest problem for those forest keepers.In order to get rid of termites in the whole economic forest region, the forest protection agency contact ZJUTT.What s more, termites have tenacious vitality and will soon spread through the forest.Simply placing the drugs that will kill the termites is also a way we might use when locating the nest is quite impossible or the nest is quite dispersed.However, the drug used in this way is toxic to many species other than termites, and will produces much ecological pressure consequently.The special hazardous way of termites makes people ignore their invasion at the early time.Termites will die after feeding in the trap.This habit also makes termites one the city pests, which are the most difficult and expensive to control.First, termites have the strong adaptability and viability.Every summer, the termites are flying all around.Finally, the termites disappear from the region.The other is that, the holes left by termites crawling could affect the integrity and security of buildings, dams and trees.Termites are widely recognized as the fifth pest around the world, based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards woods and infrastructure.Sometimes we can do precautions by pesticide application or by reinforcing the buildings that might suffer from the termites.Walk in the supermarket and pick up the household type termites killing device produced by ZJUTT.If the termites are convicted by the technicians, termites control shoold be applied first to eliminate the future danger.What\u0091s more, the hazards caused by termites to communal facilities such as large reinforced concrete bridges, gas lines, are frequently reported these years.Taking the Coptotermes formosanus as an example, which is the most harmful termite around the world; however this species once only distributed in several regions, such as Chinese mainland and Taiwan province.With the transportation of massive supplies in World War II, these termites  distribution range has gradually enlarged.In the following ten years, if possible, it could acheive mass production of TERMITE TERMINATOR and could be widely used with our designed devices.Separately over expressed in E.coli and another host, toxins were then delivered to the termites by the cell carrier.We expect that the drug will attach to the termite and be carried back to the nest, then the whole nest of termite can be killed for one time.Account for the effect of warm wet air current from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, many provinces with warm climate, plentiful water and abundant vegetation own special preferences for termites.Thus, there is a group of people working in the forest protection agency to take care of these trees.In the breeding heyday, a mature termite queen s daily oviposition is over ten thousand.Termite is an ancient social insect in the world for about 0.13 billion years.According to the above result, Zhejiang is one of the most regions of termite occupation and plagued by them.In mainland China, Coptotermes formosanus is the kind of species doing harm to housing constructions even on 20 floors; woods; communication facilities ect.It can be absorbed through and damage the mucous membranes; also harmful to the kidneys and liver.Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.With the map and other information that the agency provided, ZJUTT will draw up a plan with the optimum locations for killing devices placement.Although application with a garden hose and sprayer is relatively easy, gardeners can t simply apply nematodes to the landscape whenever they feel like it and expect them to work.As for rural country housing and landacaping? Coptotermes formosanus is the main species.Devices will be taken back to the company for sterilization and reuse.This is really a staggering number and it is the fact.As for urban housing, Reticulitermes speratus is the main species followed by Coptotermes formosanus.We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs.We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs.2013 reported in the literature, 371 destructive termite species occupy 12.5% of current total species.One is that termites take materials rich in lignocellulose as food, which causes property damage to human beings.Given that a termite weighed 1 gram, then everyone around the world should own about 500 thousand termites!Calcolated amount of food have been beforehand put into the device.Apply nematodes at dawn or dusk, because high levels of ultraviolet rays from the sun can kill them.You need to use live nematodes as soon as possible for maximum efficacy, because they have a limited shelf life.But the cost could be huge and in many cases we don t have ways to determine the range of the precautions.If they become dry, they could die.Nematodes do their work under the soil surface, gardeners don t see dead insect bodies, making efficacy hard to measure.According to the experimental results of computer simulation, average per person holds 0.5 tons of termite resources.They are now filling nearly every corner of the globe, from tropical regions to subtropical ones, which occupies 50% of the earth s area.It requires a lot of human cost in the early days.They may live in the interlayer of ceiling, walls or wood floor, eating your clothes, books and furniture.Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device with the function of monitoring and terminating for better achieving.Tree keepers together with company technicians will bring the device to the place.We decided to have the carrier for: reducing the loss; improving transport efficiency; targeting the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment to some extent.When repairing is needed, ZJUTT technicians will show up first, rather than the maintenance worker.Adequate moisture is the most important -- nematodes need water to move and find host insects.Technical staff will go to the forest for field trips to evaluate the severity.The spawning of one year reaches up to five hundred millions.Third, termites could achieve different-distance spread and distribution by virtue of flight spread, pervasive invasion and factitious carry, owning to their strong transmission capacity.The propagation of termites sometimes results in wide spread of termites  harm.These devices are used to attract termites to check if there is any new hidden termites nest.It is reported that, the direct loss induced by termites is beyond 220 billion dollars per year.These are very small unsegmented worm species which search for hosts, like termites, and burrow into them, causing death within approximately 48 hours.He advise the school stuff to buy a few small size termites killing devices from ZJUTT.Open the package and put it at places where termites can be seen.But what make them stressfol is that the forest regions are always inhabited by termites.Factory is the base and during improvements as well as experiments, social users data is collected for further promotion and perfection.There are termites all over the five continents.The harm that termites bring to human mainly reflects in two aspects.In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents.In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents.It often takes a long time from termites invasion to being discovered.Trees that destroyed by termites will lost their economic value.At present this kind of termites has caused serious damages in numerous countries and regions, turning into cosmopolitan pest.", "design": "Here is our device and it works in three aspects.In fact, we made a big improvement about our device on the monitor unit recently.We also design a wider ring under the cover, to avoid the slide when device shaking When using the device, customers should place the Attracting Cover with wood to attract more termites.However, when we talked about our device with Prof. Mo, an expert on termite control, he told us that when termites eat wood, their secretion flows out and sticks on the wood nearby.Further more, we decided to design a digital circuit for customers so that they may discover the situation in a shorter time with less attention paid to the device.The device works like this: Pine put in the device will attract termites and when climbing into the device, they will eat the Toxin accidently and die in or out of the device.After the effective Toxin was coated by CNC, we need a convenient device to place our poison in.Once termites eat the block, the string will elongate and another wooden block will get out of the device to alert the users.In order to be easier for the users to clean it up for a second use the device is designed to be removable.With this application, it does not matter if our customers have any problem using our device.In our new version, we abort this design and change the passageway in the box into small holes.In the last version, we used a compressed spring which is connected to a thin wooden block.By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of TERMITE TERMINATOR and present Techno-moral vignettes, focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application.Once they notice the bottom holes are getting smaller, or stuck by termites\u0092 secretion, the Trap Cover should take the place of the attracting cover and the Kill Function works!One of our goals is to kill all termites in a house.We want to kill all termites but our toxin will not be influential for a very long period.Besides functions, we think more to improve our device.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "In the last two period, Toxin starts to degrade.Here (v_{Toxin}) is the velocity that Toxin is produced.In this page, we model the process of the production and degrade of Toxin to find the influence to ({Toxin-CNC-Time}), or the degradation time of Toxin in CNC-coat.({Toxin-CNC-Time}) is the degradation time of Toxin in CNC-coat while ({Toxin-air-Time}) is that in the air.Respectively, ({CNC-digest-Time}) is the time when the bait comes into another termite s gut(trophallaxis) and the CNC-coat is completely digest there.They are (t_{2}) and (t_1), respectively.$$frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} = frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]} - frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}$$$$frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} = - frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}$$Still, use function (arctan) take the place of comparing, we get the final function.Because (n_2) must be even and (frac{1}{{x^{-100}}+1}) is the integral, we choose the last one.With some typical parameter, we use NDSolve function to solve the ordinary differential equation, the answer is as below.And (K_m) is called Michaelis constant.(V_{max,2}) is the reducing velocity when Toxin is saturation, and (K_{m,2}) is another Michaelis constantThe two equation seems simple in separate formate, but it became complex when considering time factor.For the time (t_1) is much less than (t_2), the change at that time is not obvious.frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} &=&(1-step(t,t2)) frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]} - step(t,t1) frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}\\(step) function can be placed by (frac{1}{{x^{-100}}+1}) etc.To study the tendency of the reaction, the figure is at a long time (three of four times than (t_2)), and the dark green curve is a standard (exp) function curve.We will discuss is in the next section.We do not have enough time to measure the exact time when termite digest, but I suppose we have got it, as well as the time that Toxin starts to resolve.What we concern is that when our CNC-coat is degraded, the Toxin is still in the cell.During the first two period, cell produce Toxin.(V_{max}) is the producing velocity when substrate is saturated.([S]) is substrate s concentration.There are four important parameters in our design, which are ({CNC-digest-Time}), ({CNC-degradation-Time}), ({Toxin-CNC-Time}) and ({Toxin-air-Time}).Although we can premise that the Toxin will be separate by CNC-coat, and our device, as a second protection, can stop Toxin s spread, the only device s protection may not be really enough.While the next one, means even though the CNC-coat is degraded, Toxin will degrade right away so that it will not cause environment pollution.({CNC-degradation-Time}) is when CNC-coat degrades in national condition.In the ordinary differential function, we can solve the two condition respectively, but a continues function will enhance the flexibility and simplicity.Toxalbumin is produced by cell, and resolved by enzyme or itself.We built model for the process basic on Michaelis-Menten equation.", "notebook": "Discussed the application scenario for the 5000\u0080 additional sponsership of SYNENERGENE.Contacted with

eliminate all the termites in my apartment.Some of people who choose professional institute are those who know the severity of termite damage, for example, the security mentioned above.I threw the damaged furniture and fit my house again\u0085.\u0094  Although some people have experienced the damage brought by termites, the public didn\u0092t know much about the current issue about termites in Hangzhou.Fig4: Booklets presented by Hangzhou Institute of Termite Control Photo by: Zju-igemer  Fig5: ZJU-igemer consulting staff of Termite Control Institute Photo by: Zju-igemer  Although China has already earned a profound system for termite control, people who suffer from termite damage would not always choose professional institution to deal with termite invasion.Fig1: Page of termite control of a pest control company in the U.S http://www.doyourownpestcontrol.com/termite.htm  Although Chinese has a much higher population density than America, there are more wood structure buildings in America, the level of termite damage in both countries are randomly the same.But those who didn t know much about the termites would like to buy pesticide, they think they can win the termites.Citizens do not know much about Termites\u0092 living habits and their current condition, but they all have heard about the information of termites.They used the chemical insecticide and dug out the whole nest to control termite damage.People are willing to choose professional institute to control termites, but if their scale is not very large, people may choose kill termites by themselves.Chinese termite control institute has a low charging standard, because government pays them the fundamental funds and technical assistance for local institute.More than 70% of our interviewee have experienced termite damage, and they all know that termites can destroy woods with a super speed.Commercial corporations often provide citizens housing termite control services, and government agencies do better at the maintenance of public facilities.Some of interviewees would like to choose environment-friendly lifestyle, but most people will make their decision depend on the killing effect.In this summer, igemers from ZJU-CHINA visited Hangzhou Institute Of Termite Control to get more information about the current situation of termite control and consult with them about our project design.Words on banner: We Have To Win The War Against Termites  The Government Of China has set up institutes of termite control in various provinces since 1960s, in order to have better effects for fighting against termites.Termite control in the U.S consists of two main parts------commercial corporations and government agencies.However, as what is happening in China, some people would like to deal with termites by themselves, so some companies also provide customers advisors to treat termites in a suitable way.Fig5: the public promotion page of Chinese termite control institute http://www.zgbyfz.cn/byfz.asp?cid=%B0%D7%D2%CF%CE%A3%BA%A6  American institutes pay more attention to the customer experience.At the beginning, people who focused on fighting against termites were the commons who did not have enough knowledge to deal with termites.It is worth mentioning that the destruction left by termites seems to be much more serious on historic buildings.The terrible damage to water conservancy projects caused by termites is still a great threat to the water project planning in China.The door case became into powder, all the chairs could not be used, and the reproductive termites lay on the windows.When people have problems of termite damage, they usually look for a company to solve them.80% of the dam breaks in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Region are due to termites.Fig1: People held a meeting to discuss how to control termites in 1950s.All the wooden furniture had been damaged by termites.Would you choose the pesticide, which has a bad impact to the environment but works fast and has a lower price?Obviously, provinces seated in the region south of the Yangtze River suffer more from termite damage.Question 2: Almost 50% of interviewees would choose professional institute, and another 50% prefer to buy pesticide themselves.We pick 8 typical provinces, which locate from south to north: Hainan; Guangxi; Guangdong; Fujian; Anhui; Hubei; Shandong and Liaoning, and then gather the rough data for termite damage to the housing construction.Most citizens do not know the significance of \u0091environment-friendly\u0092 and do not care about the problem, and they prefer chemical termitcide.For this reason, ZJU-IGEMers tried to promote the idea of \u0091From Nature For Nature\u0092 to realize the environment-friendly synthetic biological method to termite control--------Termite Terminator.Would you like to choose biological control method, which is much safer but costs more?In the campus of Zhejiang University, in spring and summer it is easy to see the trees intruded by termites.The website pages of American termite control company show a customer-friendly attitude and leave an effective impact to people scan their websites.One female white collar pointed out that, it doesn\u0092t matter how much it costs, the most important thing is to live healthily.Chemical insecticide costs less and the low-dose poison won\u0092t be harmful to human being.People prefer to call for governmental institutes to eliminate termites  4.The integrated control of termites begins in 1950s in China.People that do not choose biological drugs have two main reasons, one is that cheap and valid chemical is enough for them to use.Fig4: trees damaged by termites in German Park photo by: Ming Chen ZJU-instructor  Every southern city in China has experienced the electric problem caused by termite invasion beneath the surface of ground.The others are those who have a higher level of knowledge, they know that they couldn\u0092t eliminate termites just by themselves.The governmental institutes VS. Termite control companies.", "safety": "High selectivity: little to no direct toxicity to non-target insects and other shelled invertebratesThe bacterium are CNC-coated, having little to no leak of the toxic proteins consequently.Completely no harm to adults and infants when users are behaved according to our instruction Since the toxic proteins we choose are relative new, we cannot find their degradation period, degradation condition and more information related to safety.In case that our bacterium get outside and leak the toxin into the environment, we use an inducible promoter in our constructs.During the experiment, we worry that our gene modified bacterium would get out of the lab, thus we figured out several ways to make our bacterium safer.In order to avoid people wrongly operating our device, we also design an instruction of our device as below.We plan to sell our device with the instruction attached to it, and we believe that our device would be safer with our well-designed instruction.Furthermore, we considered the social safety of our whole project.However, the proteins we use are pretty like bt protein, so we will use the data of bt protein to help us analyze.About 80% can be fast digested in soil or water in 20 days, but will be a little residue (10-20%)Will NOT be reproduced in water.High selectivity: only have effects on a few certain pests including termites and cotton aphidAlready have more than 3000 registered avermetin-related products in China, passing the security check of AQSIQ (State General Administration of the People\u0092s Republic of China for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine) Because the toxic proteins we use are recently discovered, few related researches can be found online.Moreover, we put the lrgA gene under the control of a weak and constitutive promoter  BBa_J23116 to in case of the leaky expression of the CidA to prevent cell lysis.In our project, we designed a device aiming at better controlling and killng termites.The training includes how to use the machine in our lab properly, how to react correctly if there happens to be an emergency and how to protect ourselves during the experiments.When we do something that is unsafe, he will point out and make sure that we won\u0092t do it again.The Biobrick parts we have built have no safety issue according to our knowledge.In our plan, we shall build four constructs to express toxin proteins that help killing termites.When cultured with our IPTG-added medium, these bacteria would live as usual to function as a mini-factory to amplify plasmids or to produce plasmids for our use, whereas they would die due to the cell membrane lysis and genomic DNA release.This device is absolutely not allowed to be used outdoors, but is designed to be used in the house instead.Termite will be fed with these toxic proteins and death condition will be used to evaluate the toxicity.According to the chart we show below, we considered every aspect to confirm that our project are safe under given conditions..2.He teaches us how to do the experiment safely, and he will watch us to make sure that we all behave in the right way.After we designed the device, we are afraid that people might use it in a wrong way after they bought it.With regard to this CidA-LrgA system and the BNU iGEM 2014 kill switch design, we designed our own kill switch as the figure below shows.Time gradient experiments will be conducted to test how fast the proteins will start to degrade  -Proteins degradation rate will be tested under light, UV, high temperature and other conditions.-NMR will be used to detect proteins structure stability.We have a safety tutor in our lab.Gordon G D, Gordon J M.

synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the

limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\u0092s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many kinds of volatiles to induce nematodes that are harmful to these predators.We put two small pieces of circular filter paper 2.5cm from the center of the circle (Fig.Later we add 30?L suspension of the nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\u00a0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.", "design": "First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\u0092s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.The fourth area is made up of a cuboid outer shell, which can support the device.The figure above shows our product \u0096 Device 1.0.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.This change fulfills our aim to save money and energy, which is also more economical and enviromentally friendly.As shown above, device 2.0 has two shells \u0096 an outer shell and an inner shell.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.The third area is light controlling area, which includes a LED light.When it is turned on, red emission will activate the promoter and bacterial cells will express attracting substance; while the LED light is turned off, toxalbumin will be produced.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "To make the project applicable in real life, we designed a device with modified engineering bacteria inside, which can be placed in soil to attract and kill nematodes.Assuming there is a farmland, we took advantage of gas diffusion and nematodes\u0092 movement analogue simulation to find the best position for the device to be placed.We established a database to broaden the scope of our applications, combined with our methods, to kill more different pests.Additionally, it takes time for nematodes to reach the device, so we can determine the distance between the devices we place according to the three-day-period and the crawl speed of nematodes.Let L be the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment, V is nematodes\u0092 crawl speed, and T is time nematodes need to develop into adult.Firstly, we considered a square farmland, to minimize the number of equipment we use, the arrangement mode of equipment is as follows (firstly, we consider the situation with four devices arranged together).As shown above, the white circles represent the devices of colon bacillus, while the bigger circles represent diffusion, with the same odorousness in a circle.Our modeling process is given below:Nematodes can be attracted if the attraction concentration of limonene is higher than the lowest attractant concentration and then can move towards the direction of the highest odor concentration after attracted by the limonene smell[4].Engineering bacteria in our device are able to produce enough limonene as we need.Nematodes move on a 2D plane.The rules of the movement are as follows:The nematodes move towards 4 different directions: front, behind, right and left;Every time the nematode choose one of the 4 directions randomly and the probability of these 4 directions are the same;If the nematode move to the place where the gas concentration is lower than the previous position, then the nematode will move back to the previous position.We did the different simulation experiments with one device in the farmland and four devices in the farmland separately.In order to apply our hypothesis and methodology to more agricultural pests control, we established a database.And we can achieve remote control by using radio technology.With these improvements to our device, we want to figure out how we can put our technology into practice in farmland, and whether our device would be more efficient and economical than the methods used currently used in killing nematodes (crop-dusting mostly).In order to meet the lowest attractant concentration, the concentration of limonene produced by every device should be (24.8 g/cm^3).The explanations of simulation: In the video above, we built up a simulation model of the movement of nematodes using the cellular automaton in MATLAB.Based on the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment which has been acquired in the first question, we obtain:Considering that odorousness will be reduced with the increase of distance away from the device, we should only consider about the superposed odorousness at point F(considering four equipment now) to reach the lowest attractant concentration.We set the attraction time as 3 days and the distance between two devices is 100 m. As the evenly distribution of nematodes is from 5 cm to 15 cm underground, we put the device into the place which is 10 cm underground.In order to answer these two questions, especially the second one, we need to conduct a simulation of the movement of nematodes to determine the most suitable place in the farmland to place our device.In matrix A, we assume that the device is put on row i and column j (i, j).In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.It shows how nematode moves in a real farmland with the device.We hope this new environment-friendly method, based on principles of synthetic biology, could be shared with and improved by the researchers all over the world.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.Because the movement range of nematodes is within 10cm and the distance between two devices is much longer than 10cm, we can ignore the depth.When the gas diffuses in space, the concentration is not affected by temperature, aerodynamics or other factors.The device emits gas continuously and the concentration is uniform in space.And after the gas diffusion, the attractant concentration will stabilize.Considering that we need to control the density of nematodes in a proper range, we hope to do this by killing all the mature nematodes within certain period of time under the identical condition.(2i+1)(2sqrt{Dt})^{2i+1}}) end{array} end{equation}This is the schematic diagram of our device in a 300m \u00d7 300m farmland according to results of simulation.First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.Thus we obtain:Where C1 is the superposed odorousness diffused from the device, C0 is the lowest attractant concentration.According to Fick s Law, We obtain a 3-D gas diffusion model.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).Orientation of the entomogenous nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae to carbon dioxide[J].Its mathematical expression is as follows:$$frac{partial C(t,x)}{partial t} = D_{A}frac{partial ^2 C(t,x)}{partial x^2}$$C(x,t) is the concentration at the distance of X from gas source in t, N0 is the concentration of gas source, D is the diffusion coefficient.According to the model above, we obtain the gas diffusion model in 3D.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.And we found that the Meloidogyne needs 8.5d-10.5d to develop into second instar larvae from monoplast egg according to an exiting literature[9].And according to the principle of isotropy, we simplify the problem in 1D.We build a gas diffusion model to calculate the gas concentration at each point in matrices.Since the three dimensions have no difference between each other, we simplify the question into a 1-D situation according to isotropy.According to Fick s Law, points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of x Since the three dimension has no difference between each other, we simplify the question into 1-D situation according to isotropy.A brief introduction to the Fick s Law: It points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of X, the change rate of concentration to time is equal to the negative value of the change rate of diffusion flux to distance.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\u0092s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.We will update relevant information about the engineering bacteria we designed to kill the pests in our database.Currently, our database contains the biobrick we established in this project and the one established by team ZJU-CHINA.All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!Liang W, Li Q, Chen L, et al.The proportion of virtual nematode and real nematode is 0.0084.The nematodes is distributed randomly at the beginning.It\u0092s obvious that in this farmland (do not consider points on the sides of the square), point F is the farthest point away from the four equipment.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.And the procedures below were conducted in a fume hood.Step 3.What\u0092s more, squares ABCD are the simplified farmland.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.We will attract nematodes into our device in time d and kill them in time d. We found that all nematodes are killed after two \u0093slaughters\u0094.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.We hope to take a better use of this new environmental-friendly method from the context synthetic biology and share it with researchers all over the world.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.We opened the faucet of the separating funnel in order to let HCl flow into the test tube under the atmospheric pressure.In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on nematode trophic groups in a Chinese paddy-field ecosystem[J].Ye H Y, Ye B P, Wang D Y. Molecular control of memory in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans[J].This change fulfills our aim to save money and energy, which is also more economical and enviromentally friendly.As shown above, device 2.0 has two shells \u0096 an outer shell and an inner shell.", "notebook": "The goal of our modeling project is to give a best attractant of concentration so that we can determine the most economical plan.We prepared the L-limonene and D-limonene and the synthases expression E. coli (BL21,pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) without standardization of them both, which were cryopreserved with glycerol.We prepared the BW25113 competent cells in terms of the component efficiency kit, and we detected their efficiency of transformation by transforming rfp-PSB1C3 plasmids of different concentration into the cells.We transformed pSB1C3-rMpL into BW25113 competent cells to cultivate on the LB plate and inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the obtained monoclonal colony to produce bacteria solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We revived the limonene synthases expression E. coli strain preserved in glycerol.We assembled bace16-pSB1C3 and transformed it into E. coli DH5?.And we processed nematodes\u0092 chemotaxis replication experiment of limonene as well.We also did expression replication experiments by doing SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample) which came out an obvious band (89kd).We ensured the empty vector plasmid was correct with three groups of restriction digestion.We repeated the induction experiment with different concentration gradient of arabinose as before, while we just collected the precipitation without extracting proteins this time.We built a device all by handwork!We inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the monoclonal colony to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction, and we named the obtained plasmid pUC57-rMpL.We digested the plasmid PSB1C3-RFP sent by iGEM and the pUC57-rMpL with restriction enzyme separately and obtained the PSB1C3 backbone and rMpL gene segment which were connected together later on to assemble the plasmid PSB1C3-rMpL.Together with members majoring in physics, mathematics and biology, we drafted an abstract settlement concentrating on how to simulate the concentration of nematodes in chemotaxis.And we sent plasmids extracted this time for sequencing.We re-prepared the homogenate of the revived E. coli-BL21(pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) for SDS-PAGE and enlarge cultivated the standard bacteria (BL21-pSB1c3) transformed the second time to express the objective product.We transformed bace16-pSB1C3 into the newly obtained BW25113 competent cells to express for another time, and examined the result with SDS-PAGE.We went on the expression experiment of rMpL as above except that we added parallel controll groups whereas canceled the control ones expressed under 37C and prolonged the expression period.After the result of digestion exam was correct we extracted the plasmid and did sequencing, and we transformed the plasmid with correct sequence into E. coli BW25113 to establish expression strain.We activated the preserved culture and enlarge cultivated it in 250 mL conical flask, inducting expression with different concentration gradient of L-arabinose, we collected the precipitation after centrifuging the bacteria solution.Additionally, we learned the life history, growth properities and feeding method of nematodes.We prepared nematodes for enlarge cultivation and induced expression of the LS expression E. coli, and we synchronized a batch of nematodes for verification.We digested rfp-pSB1C3 with two isocaudamas Spe I and Xba I and prepared empty vector plasmid as negative control of whether the desired gene expressed.Since we could get the solution of best concentration of attractant and the diffusion of nematodes, we decided to go towards a further step.We transformed into E. coli DH5? the bace16-pSB1C3 to find that the result of plasmid extraction and enzyme digestion was correct, thus we confirmed the problem was from the expression strain.We re-cultivated the collected bacteria and mixed up the recombined bacteria with the control ones to a certain scale (1:4) to coat on NGM medium, preparing for nematodes cultivation of toxic test.Another important module of our project is to build a database which researchers and even farmers can get information of bio-pesticide easily.Then we recycled the backbone and gene segments following the agarose gel DNA extraction kit and linked them to produce plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3 and d-limonene-pSB1C3.We continued to watch the movement of nematodes under toxic test, where the nematodes of M9 group was generally active, partly died of bace16 and heated bace16 groups, and acted normally in pSB1C3 group.Another SDS-PAGE of extracellular proteins extract was run while the objective band was still not observed.However, we still failed to observe obvious expression of rMpL, against which we suspected there occurred something wrong with the expression bacteria and planed to change bacteria strain to express de novo.We put the database on the github.com and it can be edited and added new items by all users.We transferred plasmids with correct sequenced d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS gene into expression strain E. coli BL21 respectively to express LS and GPPS.The problem was confirmed to be from the expression strain as mentioned above, so we adopted a new strain of BW25113 and continued our experiment.We enlarge cultivated the standard LS expression bacteria (E. coli-BW2513-pSB1C3) and expressed the objective produce (in contrast with empty vector).Congratulations!We tried some simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation to be familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We designed parts rMpL and bace16 by adding pBAD promoter (BBa_K206000) and RBS(BBa_B0034) to the upstream region of rMpL gene and bace16 gene, and we committed the GENEWIZ company to synthesize the rMpL and bace16 gene segment.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.So we re-transformed the plasmids from the company into E. coli DH5?and BL21 separately and did all the cultivation, plasmid extraction, enzyme digestion de novo to make sure the examine result correct.The results of SDS-PAGE suggested that d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS were expressed successfully.Incubate the bacteria with 8 (mu)M, 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose , run SDS-PAGE after ammonium sulfate precipitation.Change the E. coli strain to express rMpL, only add 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose for incubation this time.To test if rMpL is expressed in the pallet or the supernatant, ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to enrich the protein.using Ultrasonication and SDS-PAGE are also used during this process.This week we discussed factors that would influence the putting model of equipment on the farmland.So we extracted the bace16-pSB1C3 from the expression strain BW25113 for restriction enzyme digestion and no objective band was extracted still.We inoculated the obtained monoclonal colony into 10 mL centrifuge tubes to produce bacterium solution for plasmid extraction, the enzyme digestion result of which was incorrect that a band around 500~750 bp appeared whereas the backbone band lost.We examined the extracted plasmid with enzyme digestion, no objective band observed as a result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry powder.However, we regrettably observed that the effect of expression is not ideal from the SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis of both the homogenate and the supernatant.We realized that our original assumption that we regarded nematodes as static models couldn t react to some essential properties of nematode moving.We transformed the plasmid rfp-pSB1C3(BBa_J04450) in DH5? and proceeded amplification to obtain the standard plasmid backbone.We prepared some common used reagent such as TAE, antibiotics and LB cultural medium.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.We extracted the plasmid and did restriction enzyme digestion to test and verify the plasmid backbone PSB1C3, and preserve the correct plasmid for subsequent experimental use.We designed the sequence of Limonene synthase (LS) that would be transformed to E. coli to express.Our designed sequences were based on the two cDNA sequences of LS expression sequence--Citrus unshiu CitMTSE1 for d-limonene synthase and Mentha spicata 4S-limonene synthase, together with prefix and suffix codes and restriction enzyme cutting site were sent to the company for optimum synthesis.We obtained the plasmid of gene rMpL with PUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.The results verified that compound limonene could attract nematodes preliminarily.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria of experimental group and control group.We did SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample), no significant difference observed between the bands.In addition, the differences between bands of BW25113 and BL21 were obvious when ran SDS-PAGE together whereas the objective band of BW25113 couldn t be ensured.We expressed bace16 protein twice and prolonged the expression period to overnight.At the same time, we carried out the experiment of attractive interactions of limonene towards nematodes several times.Third, we had built a basic frame of the database.Sequencing gene l-limonene and d-limonene synthesized by the company to get an unsatisfactory result, we speculated that these plasmids were extracted from the wrong BW25113.Also we improved our device and made a 3D model of it, which we called Device 2.0.To verify whether limonene had been synthesized by bacteria, the fermentation broth was tested by GC-MS in School of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University.According to pair t test, we concluded that limonene could attract nematodes.According to the original paper, rMpL is soluble protein expressed inside the cell, so target protein should be still in pallets.The correct plasmids examined with restricton enzyme digestion was preserved in -20\u00b0, named l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57.We digested the plasmid pSB1C3-RFP from iGEM as well as l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57 separately with restriction enzymes to get pSB1C3 backbone and the two gene segments, among which the brightness of pSB1C3 backbone band was quite weak.That\u0092s why we had to make it by hands.We tried another protocol of replication experiment as increasing the amount of sample whereas the effect was still not ideal indicated by the statistical result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.Considering there are so many factors can\u0092t be predicted in the real situation, we talked about how to idealize and simplify our putting model.In order to testify if engineering bacteria have the ability to express limonene, amplification cultured bacteria liquid covered with n-hexane was cultured in the shaking table to express production.Inhibition is observed on the plate inoculated with recombinat bacteria.Through a lot of discussion among our group, and with accumulating realization and knowledge of this program, we finally came up with a method to solve the problem of how to place equipment we made on the farmland.We optimized the protocol of replication experiment on and on, and the growth condition of nematodes is favorable.Finally, we chose traditional technology to produce devices in the future if it was verified that our device had high value of application.At the same time, we make the model revision.Run SDS-PAGE and get bands which might be rMpL.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria.Still, we failed to observe objective band at all the supernatant of bacteria, homogenate and supernatant of ultrasonic broken cells.We induced expression of rMpL continuously with arabinose in concentration gradient to acquire a stable expression condition.Meanwhile, it appeared to be some problems of other groups\u0092 digestion too, against which we speculated that the cause may be the pollution of reagent, star activity or something wrong with the expression strain.GENEWIZ gave us the relevant feedback in time and modified the two sequences to synthesize again.We did the simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation again to be further familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We started to work on it.We transformed the obtained plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3?d-limonene-pSB1C3 into E. coli BW25113 and cultivated 10mL centrifuge tube with them to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We found the gene sequence of bace16(AAV3D0845) and the cDNA sequence of MpL(GeneBank accession number HQ449739) from the Genebank, and optimized the coded sequences in E. coli.After we determined the theme of our project, we recuited more undergraduates from related colleges, including college of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.Second, the device we had made actually was not applicable enough, which required further improvement.No positive results are observed in 4 days.Cultivate recombinant bacteria, bacteria with empty vector or OP50 bacteria for nematoxicity test of rMpL protein.As we discussed the influencing factors last week, our main work this week was to search documents to see what exact influence these factors would bring to our result, and whether these factors can be ignored or idealized.After being amplification cultured and expressing aiming products, the bacteria were smashed by ultrasonication.However, the cost of product by 3D print is too high.We also transferred empty pSB1C3 plasmids into expression strain E. coli BL21 and regarded them as the control group.Finally our plan is to design and build a debug device.We cultivated nematodes and proceeded synchronization, and we did replication experiment of baiting nematodes with linalool using pure chemical compound (linalool).", "protocol": "Incubate upside down at 37\u00b0C overnight.Flush nematodes from the plate

on a new plate.Grow slowly at 16\u00b0C and grow fast at 25\u00b0C while egg laying amount declines.Inoculate NGM medium with 150~200 (mu)L OP50, incubate at 37\u00b0C for 12hr.", "result": "2) occurs inBased on the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP in the pathways mentioned above, GPP synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation between IPP and DMAPP to synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the burden for E. coli, so in our research, we transferred both GPPS gene and LS gene into theIn our project we decided to use E. coli, MEP pathway to express limonene.We then add 5?L 5% limonene (T) and DMSO (C) respectively at the two small circular filters in the experimental groups(Fig.This proves that many terpenes can attract plant-parasitic nematodes in naturalSome researches showed that limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\u0092s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many

nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\u00a0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.", "safety": "In addition, we established a photoinduced bidirectional transcription system regulated by light, where we can divide the process of attracting and killing nematodes into two periods to realize the relatively timing and quantitative release of the toxic proteins, bringing down the retention in the environment.Thirdly, a suicide system was constructed based on the principles of quorum sensing in microorganisms which would enable us to control the bacterial colony density artificially and therefore the quantity of engineering bacteria can be maintained in a stable and controllable range.Considering the biosafety, we improved device 2.0 into a relatively closed unit, and we also designed a dome to cover the medium.(Fig.1)We replaced GFP and RFP with limonene synthase and toxic protein respectively, so the release of the two proteins can be regulated by gp35 directly, and by light signals indirectly.Generally speaking, the Switch system works in this way--provide the system with light of wavelength in 600nm at first so gene gp35 will be repressed and the system will express the chemical attractants like limonene.In conclusion, the significance of our system is that we have built a photoinduced bidirectional system to avoid a simultaneous and strong expression of the bait and toxic proteins, in which way we can avoid the potential harm done to environment by the system.We not only considered the potential safety problem caused by the high expression of the toxic protein and attractant, but also designed a suicide system for our engineering bacterias to solve the problem by regulating the population size of our bacterias.We built our system based on the phenomenon of quorum sensing[1].In addition, replacement as well as remove of medium and engineering bacteria would all be done in the labs or safety rooms of factories which guarantee relative closure of the device used in farmland and avoid engineering bacteria spreading.Although Bace16 and rMpL are both toxic proteins towards nematodes specially, the over expression of these proteins can also break the ecological equilibrium inevitably.While when the concentration of attractants reaches a certain point (see modeling part), we would turn off the light to trigger the expressing of protein gp35 to push the system work in a reverse direction so that the toxic protein would be expressed.In addition, after the engineering bacteria works, the device would be recycled and the residual bacteria would be disinfected.3.Is it safer, cheaper, or better than other technologies that do the same thing?We concluded the action objects and disadvantages of various traditional nematicides of China according to related literatures, and the result is shown below.High toxicity Do harm to the soil, the environment even the health.This complex can bind with promoter luxpR, after which the transcription of mazf gene in the downstream will be triggered and bacterias will be killed by toxin protein MazF[2].Firstly, we designed a device to cultivate E.coli inside and restricted their movement at the same time, thus preventing the difussion of our engineering bacteria to soil.Will it be sterilized, discarded, or recycled?Our device is designed to be recyclable so the growing state can be checked at regular intervals, which means once something wrong happens, we can adjust the bacterial colony timely.With the biosynthesis of PCB, Cph8 can serve as a photoreceptor that regulates gene expression through PompC.In order to regulate the direction of promoter J23110 under the light signal, an integrase, gp35, is added to the upstream region of the PompC promoter.We constructed two main circuits.When gp35 expresses, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.Cph1 is a member of the plant photoreceptor family.As for environmental safety, on one hand, we design a semi-closed device to avoid the spread of engineering bacterias in which way we could increase the safety level and improve the attracting and killing efficiency of our bacteria; On the other hand, light-regulated bidirectional transcription system can avoid over-expression of toxin proteins, and the design of suicide part can regulate the population density of engineering bacteria.This system can be divided into three main parts: photoinduced system, bidirectional transcriptional system and bait-killer system.The red light sensor (Cph8) is a fusion protein which consists of a phytochrome Cph1 and a histidine kinase domain, Envz-OmpR.The first one expresses gp35 serine integrase,(Fig.1) which can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP, the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome.All in all, biosafety is ensured in both the developing and the application stage of our project.1.At first, the plasmid expresses GFP.It is probably do harm to the crops.It is suitable for the burst of the nematodes disasters.Next it is beneficial to the creatures who live in the environment suffering serious nematodes disasters because the traditional nematicides do harm to human.For instance, all team members in the lab should wear clothes for lab-use, wear gloves and work in the super clean bench when necessary; poison reagent should be used in the fuming cupboard; and the waste liquid and medium

the degradation of insecticide pyrethroids is 3-phenoxybenzoate (3-PBA).Because of the wide use of pyrethroids and the stability of the diarylether compound itself, 3-PBA is typically detected as an important environmental contaminant.The main metabolite in the degradation of insecticide pyrethroids is 3-phenoxybenzoate (3-PBA) which is is typically detected as an important environmental contaminant[1].Through searching a large number of papers and analyzing data, we found that the harms of 3-PBA are as follows:The half life period of 3-PBA is about 180 days , longer than most of pyrethroids, making it difficult to be degraded in the environment.Hindering the mineralization of pyrethroids?which cut off the biodegradation pathway that pesticide is transformed into non-toxic (poisonousless) small molecule.3-PBA is an important material in chemical industryTo analyze the toxicity of the 3-PBA, we used fruit fly to test.Our device is designed to degrade 3-phenoxybenzoatecompletelyFig2.The passway of biodegradation of 3-pba in our engineering bacteriaCopA, the principal copper effluxATPase in Escherichia coli, is induced by elevated copper in the medium[1].Gene cluster pbaA1A2B and gene pbaC encode the 3-phenoxybenzoate 1 ,2 -dioxygenase,which is an angular dioxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation in the 1 and 2  positions of the benzene moiety of 3-phenoxybenzoate(3-PBA)[4], yielding 3-hydroxybenzoate(3-HBA)[5] and catechol.D .Changes in fluorescenceintensity in E.coli which do not contain copA promoter comparing with two strains.We placed insulator RiboJ between copA promoter and RBS(Fig.5).Fig.5.Two device used to detect copper in solution, the upper device has riboJ and the under one has no riboJ.Catechol , an intermediate metabolite of 3-PBA, is toxic to the Escherichia coli.Output ( fluorescence) depended only on the activity of copA promoter when be induced, and not the sequence at the part junction.In the lab, we aim to realize the biodegradation of 3-PBA using recombinant plasmid.By measuring fluorescence intensity in cells by flow cytometer,we got data to analyze sensitivity and specificity of copA promoter.In our experiment, copA promoter was induced by different concentration of copper ion (37.5umol/L, 50umol/L, 62.5umol/L, 75umol/L) .We tested 3-PBA s influence on reproductive capacity of fruit fly, and found that 3-PBA can affect the normal secreting of sex hormone.We counted the number of the new imagoes hatched by flies that were fed in medium with 3-PBA before.In comparison of two graphs A, B, we can obviously find that the degradation of protein is much faster in DH5? than that in BL21 (DE3)?because BL21 (DE3) has a deficiency of protease.CopA promoter is active in the presence of copper ion.We intended to character copA promoter independently.Actually, the fluorescence which produced by the leakage of copA will not change.The change quantity comes from the different growth periods of the E.coli.In the group of 0?mol/L Cu2+, the fluorescence shows a trend of falling firstly then rising(Fig.3C).So bacteria will go through a period of growing from growth period to maturation period, so as to the change of the fluorescence.Maturation period is great period for the expression of protein.The genes pbaC-pbaA1A2B-c23o-mhbDHIM, encoding enzymes of the 3-phenoxybenzoate degradation pathway were successfully built finally.and the whole metabolic pathway is shown in Fig2..Fig1.Based on these facts we can get a formula Net proceeds(N)=Benefit(B)-Cost(C).Simplest genetic circuit ---our small step to degradationWe used constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) to transcribe downstream genes including gene cluster pbaA1A2B and C23O.Insecticide pyrethroids are widely used in the agricultural production to control the insect pest.However, the efficiency of removal of these compounds by bacteria is actually low for they evolve on the basis of environmental fitness rather than degradation efficiency.Therefore , we utilized RiboJ which was placed between promoter and protein coding sequence to eliminate the interference of two different parts.However, according to our preliminary experiment , Sphingobiumwenxiniae JZ-1T is easy to lose the ability of degradation and cannot grow in LB medium containing high concentration of 3-PBA.Fig.3.A.Changes in fluorescenceintensity induced by different concentration of copper ion in E.coli BL21 (DE3).RiboJ can reliably maintain relative promoter strengths.We test copA promoter in BL21 (DE3),DH5?.CopA promoter has relative leaky basal expression by comparing the negative control\u0092s output and basal leakage of copA promoter in E. coli expression systems(Fig.4).As a metabolite, 3-PBA is easy to be ignored by people.", "design": "Sphingobium wenxiniae JZ-1 was designed to put into the unit to degrade pyrethroids.Meeting the standard of farmland discharge in China main landAccording to the urban sewage treatment method , sedimentation , sludge treatment , disinfecton[5] can cut down the index value to meet the standard.Fig.The screen shoot cut for the 3D vision of the physcial unit*The whole unit is divided into five rooms and they are numbered separately (the second room is under the first room; number 5 is not marked and the fifth room is near the fourth room from right to left orientation ) and all the plates used to separate the unit into five rooms are covered by the 0.22?m bacterial membrane to prevent the bacterial escape.On the bottom of the first room there is acticarbon to pretreat the water to be purified.Both 3-PBA and pyrethroids can be found in the run off water.For being eager to take the first steps to make our project real, we designed a physcial unit applied in the field to purify farmland runoff water (regarded as the main factor of agricultral pollution[1]) including 3-PBA and pyrethroids.Through farmland investigation, we found runoff water from cropland was seldom collected and purified.3) The ponds can collect the contaminant [4].To put the engineered bacteria into practice, some issues have to be handled.Meeting the standard of farmland discharge in China main land3-PBA comes from its parent compounds pyrethroids which are more frequently touched by the public and also is used as a generic biomarker for multiple pyrethroids exposure for pyrethroid residues in the environment.Set a man-made pond(?) to collect pyrethroids and 3-PBA and the physical unit(?) is beside the pond.The unit is pumped.The physical unit will be put into the places applied pyrethroids to achieve its value.2) people in the research institutes always want to use plant ryegrass and photinia fraseri to lighten contamination[3].Based on documents, we found 1) people had no idea about farmland runoff water disposal [2].Between the pond and the place applied pyrethroids(?) there is a moderate climb(?) to help the pyrethroids and 3-PBA collecting.Avoiding to pollute the drinking water source the man-made pond should be at least away from the water source 90 meters.The third room is used to cut down the BOD and COD index value applying yeast and Actinobacillus.Based on our questionnaire, about 10% of interviewees come from rural areas, but only 3.5% of the whole interviewees know that pyrethroids are widely used pesticides

uranium adsorption and recovery - we needed a protein polymer network which contains several functional modules.To address these drawbacks, the Peking iGEM team put forward the Uranyl Reaper project, which aimed to develop an innovative method to deal with uranium pollution.In order to achieve this goal, we designed an extraordinary biological adsorption polymer network which was produced by engineered bacteria and self-assembled completely autonomously.How to collect the protein polymer network together with the adsorbed uranyl from the environment?Impressively, in a trial where the concentration of uranyl was set at 10?M, the polymer network with the SUP module was able to sequester nearly 90% of total uranyl ions within just one minute.The fusion proteins could be brought to their working concentration by concentrating them directly in the culture supernatants, and the resulting crude concentrates could be used directly for the ultimate goal - the Uranium Reaper.Inspired by the autocatalytic formation of the isopeptide bond between a Lys and an Asp residue in the CnaB2 protein from S. pyogenes, researchers engineered a pair of complementary truncations of CnaB2, called SpyTag and SpyCatcher1.the results indicated that the crosslinking reaction between the Triple SpyCatcher and fusion proteins could be completed in 1 hour.Considering that uranium mainly exists as uranyl ion and its carbonate in aqueous solution, we applied the Super Uranyl Binding Protein (SUP), which was designed specifically to bind uranyl via structural calculation and functional modification.Finally, signal sequences derived from OmpA, LTIIb and PhoA were found to be efficient mediators for the secretion of our recombinant proteins.Whether in E. coli or B. subtilis, secretory proteins usually contain signal peptides that are essential for their export from the cytoplasm.Which signal peptide would best promote the secretion of our constructs was inscrutable, so a library was built in order to screen for the most suitable candidates.In view of existing as well as potential future uranium pollution, the current complicated, time-consuming, inefficient and expensive treatment methods seem woefully out-of-date.[1]Zakeri, B., et al., Peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein, through engineering a bacterial adhesin.A schematic graph of the whole project is shown in Fig.", "human_practice": "The Brochure designed for public education about the project, synthetic biology and iGEM.Additionally, we popularized iGEM among middle school students from the 2016 Peking University Alumni Children\u0092s Summer Camp (Fig.After learning about the public opinion on uranium, uranium pollution, and synthetic biology, we decided to design a popular science brochure (Fig.Uranyl concentrations in water from Weiming Lake and in coal-washing wastewater  In order to assess whether there are potential dangers in our immediate vicinity, we extracted freshwater samples from Weiming Lake on campus and coal-washing wastewater from Shan Xi province, and measured the uranyl concentrations of the water samples by ICP-MS.It could thus be demonstrated that we had no need to worry too much about the effects of uranium pollution in daily life because the amount of uranium around us was within the normal range even in an otherwise quite polluted environment, such as around coal-mining operations.Additionally, we also measured the intensity of radiation in the nuclear environmental chemistry laboratory where we did the experiments with uranyl-containing solutions.), with the aim of helping them to develop a passion for biology, life sciences and synthetic biology.During this summer camp, there was a team coming to visit our lab and they were quite interested in the routine work of the iGEM team (Fig.In addition to the questionnaire survey and interviews of front-end units and experts, we have done more work related to social practice.Interestingly, the radiation intensity value in the work area was close to that determined in the playground, which could be regarded as the background value.Both were well within the drinking-water standard of the EPA which states that the amount of uranium shall not exceed 30 ?g/L, or about 126 nM1.", "modeling": "They made it a way to choose the monomers suitable for crosslinking reaction.The Peking iGEM Team has studied and expanded Paul J. Flory s method to predict the molecular weight distribution of polymer.They compared their reaper\u0092s experimental molecular weight distribution data with the theoretical one and find it is necessary to improve the polymer network s orthogonality with its functional protein.The Peking iGEM team 2016 has set up a model on the basis of the principles of polymer science, to describe the fundamental properties of our bio-materials.The Peking iGEM Team has learned Wallace H.

special software which could be used to calculate the molecular weight distribution of protein polymers using Flory\u0092s theory.", "safety": "We did not make any contact with genuine, and thus potentially dangerous, pollution samples from the field.Because the bacteria used to produce and secrete the proteins were sequestered in enclosed environments, such as fermenters, and we plan on only using the proteins instead of live bacteria to deal with pollution in the environment, we did not add a kill-switch in this project.What we did ourselves was only to use the simulated pollution scenes for the proof-of-principle test in the Bio-safety Level 2 iGEM lab, which means that we never made any contact with genuine, potentially dangerous pollution samples from the field.As mentioned above, the DNA parts are absolutely safe because they encode non-hazardous proteins such as SpyCatcher, SpyTag, SUP, mSA and their combinations.Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experimentThe original intention of the project was to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized material to deal with uranium pollution in the environment.The bench work followed some basic regulations as below:Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission was strictly prohibited.All involved participants needed to understand the experiment completely before commencing work.Any steps involving potential release of live microorganisms were performed in a bio-safety cabinet.Appliances such as Bunsen burners, electric heaters and microwave ovens were not left unattended while in use.All liquid and solid waste potentially containing living organism was sterilized.The entire lab was sterilized using UV-light every week.The last person to leave the lab always made sure that water, electricity, gas, and the air conditioner were shut down, and doors and windows have been locked before leaving.For the proof-of principle test, all uranyl solutions were prepared by specially trained professional researchers in the Nuclear Environmental Chemistry Group of Peking University.Additionally, the bacterial hosts are laboratory strains which are likely to be highly uncompetitive compared wild bacteria in the outside environment.During the utilization of the bio-functional polymer network, uranyl ions are enriched to a high concentration, which is a potential cause for concern.This year\u0092s Peking iGEM Team is trying to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized biomaterial to deal with uranium pollution in the environment, using the methods of synthetic biology.In order to prove the usefulness of the concept, we did a series of experiments using simulated pollution scenes which were constructed by dissolving uranyl nitrate hexahydrate either in TBS buffer or in environmental water samples from the Weiming Lake on campus and the Bohai Sea.The strains are restricted to the lab so that the cells produce the Uranium Reaper system are continuously under rigorous control without any possibility to contact the outside environment.All media that had come in contact with bacteria were sterilized to prevent any escape of microbes.According to the requirements of iGEM policy we never performed any dangerous experiments in daily bench work or faced any unusual safety issues.The characteristics of these parts had been described in detail in previous work, and all part collections, such as the signal peptide library were derived from parts that are nonpathogenic and harmless to humans or the environment.Almost all the parts in the project were modified from pre-existing iGEM parts, such as SUP, LBP and so on.It is thus conclusive that none of the parts would raise any safety issues according to current professional knowledge.", "keywords": "TAT-Apoptin antibiotics mechanical encryption calcitonin LC-Cutinase fusicoccin tetracycline controlled polystyrene", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite":

contribution encouraged and celebrated in a few centers of \u0091irradiation,\u0092 such as London\u0092s Royal College of Art Design Interactions program or Le Laboratoire, an idea incubator in

are often joyous contaminations in which scientists feel, even if just for a moment, liberated from the rigor of peer review and free to attempt intuitive leaps.Unlike biomimicry, cradle to cradle, and the popular but frustratingly vague \u0091green design\u0092, biodesign refers specifically to the incorporation of living organisms as essential components, enhancing the function of the finished work.Biodesign harnesses living materials, whether they are cultured tissues or plants, and embodies the dream of organic design: watching objects grow and, after the first impulse, letting nature, the best among all engineers and architects, run its course.In designers\u0092 ability to build scenarios and prototypes of behavior lies a power that they should protect and cherish, and that will become even more important in the future.Biodesign goes further than other biology-inspired approaches to design and fabrication.It goes without saying that when the materials of design are not plastics, wood, ceramics, or glass, but rather living beings or living tissues, the implications of every project reach far beyond the form/function equation and any idea of comfort, modernity, or

antibodies, and we conjugated CHIKV envelope protein in presence of an excess of pathogen-free mosquito proteins.Schematic representation of the C2 fusion protein.The C2 fusion protein is composed of the silica-binding peptide (Si4, in red), the cellulose-binding domain of Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa, in green), the B domain of staphylococcal protein A (BpA, in blue).Once we received the sequence encoding for the protein (named construction C1 or C2, size 921bp, with a C-ter or N-ter His-Tag respectively), we amplified it by PCR by using specific primers (For, Rev, see PCR protocol) (Fig.Then, in the presence of an excess of non-specific proteins such as BSA, we showed that we maintained the specificity of our detection method (data not shown).In parallel, we did the same experiment to detect YFV envelope protein into infected mosquitoes (day 11 post-infection) (Performed by a coach with BHS clearance, see Safety conditions).By replacing the membrane by the patch, we observed a signal when CHIKV envelope protein is present, but non-specific interactions are clearly visible (Fig.We clearly noted the appearance of bands at about 25 kDa, the expected size of our fusion protein (24\u00a0967 Da), but also at about 50 kDa (Fig.We revealed the interactions by incubating membranes with the HRP\u0092s substrate.First, we tested whether our detection method was working by using single purified viral protein of yellow fever virus (YFVp).Then, we incubated coated membranes with conjugated mosquito proteins in the presence or absence of CHIKV envelope protein.After incubation with or without our fusion protein, we determined the quantity of free silicic acid by a spectrophotometric method, since biosilification process consumes silicic acid to form silica (Fig.Finally, when patches became available after pressure assembly of cellulose-C2 protein, we repeated the immuno dection assay experiment on the composite patches (cellulose-silica + fusion protein).However, we noted an important increase of signal when CHIKV envelope protein is present in the mixture.In addition to the fact that these results showed that our detection method worked, we also plan to determine the sensitivity of the method by using different amounts of CHIKV envelope proteins in the mixture.It is obvious that we have to improve the specificity of our detection method in the presence of mosquito lysate.The fusion protein we designed contains the silica-binding peptide (Si4), the cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa), and the antibody-binding B domain of staphylococcal protein A (BpA).Owing to the intrinsic affinity of C2 for cellulose, we had to revert to a polystyrene column for purification to work.Therefore, the silification yield after two hours is up to 84% with the C2 protein whereas the yield without the protein is 0% (Fig.Moreover, heterogeneity of degradation between the patches contributed to the fact that we cannot come to a conclusion (signal intensity was measured by mean intensity in regions of interests).First, we used a source of silicic acid, the tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), which is an inactive form of silicic acid.We clearly noted that the 25 kDa and 50 kDa proteins were retained by cellulose, instead of the non-specific BSA (Fig.Once checked, we cloned our construct into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain, a specific dedicated strain to produce high amounts of desired proteins under a T7 promoter.Polymerase chain reaction of DNA sequence of the fusion protein (C1 and C2).C1 and C2 sequences (lanes 1 and 4, respectively) were amplified post-synthesis to generate sufficient material for cloning.Based on the input of specifications by experts in the field (entomologists, mosquito control officers, virologists..), and the impact of the economy and sociology of the places where we will apply our project, namely mostly tropical and developing countries, on the scientific process of detection (ecosystem of the mosquitoes, state of the samples containing pathogen antigens, safety,\u0085) we were able to generate a trapping device with the help of ideation, prototyping and 3D modeling software.As control, we observed that BSA remained in the supernatant and didn\u0092t bind to cellulose.As described by Goldstein et al1, we mixed cellulose with an excess of competitor non-specific protein (BSA), and with or without our protein of interest (Fig.After washing and centrifugation, we harvested proteins from supernatant and the cellulose-based pellet in order to analyze them by SDS-PAGE.The fusion protein led to the production of 175 \u00b5g of silica after 2 hours.Immunodetection of envelope protein of CHIKV or YFV using the composite patch  Immunodetection of E(CHIKV) in presence of mosquito proteins onto coated-composite patches.Composite patches were obtained with a mix of cellulose and silica gel, either by mechanical mixing or produced in the one pot experiment.MW : molecular weight marker.After determining the concentration of each fraction by Bradford assay, we tested the efficiency of our protein to bind to cellulose and to catalyze the biosilification reaction.We noted a basal level of interaction between the CHIKV-specific antibody 3E4 and mosquito proteins (Fig.However, some dimers seem to remain in the second washing supernatant because the initial protein concentration was too high: the binding sites were saturated.Indeed, data showed that almost no monomer remained in the supernatant after the second wash, but the pellet contained most of the protein.Immunodetection of envelope protein of CHIKV within mosquito lysate (A) Immunodetection of E(CHIKV)within mosquito lysate by using specific 4E3 antibody on PVDF membranes.The former resist to manipulation whereas the latter break when they are manipulated.At the time of this writing, we have sent the patches to the iGEM TU Delft 2016 team to be characterized, by electron microscopy.Our patch aims at detecting mosquito-borne pathogen antigens.(A) Schematic diagram of the cellulose-binding method.Additionnaly, we assumed that all integrated proteins are silified, but we only observed 84% yield, thus generating two states in the system.In lanes 1 and 4 we see that a PCR product was amplified with the expected size.With collaborations, public education, public opinion, polling, we were able to generate a scenario that encompasses the use of our Mos(kit)o device in the real world.After that, insert was extracted from the gel, and ligated into digested and dephosphorylated pET43.1a, the expression vector (Fig.(B) After incubation with C2, a polymer silica gel is formed and silification is evaluated by molybdate assay (A) Silica gel pellets recovered after 2 hours of silification and centrifugation, for the monomer (left) and the dimer (right).After bacteria culture and plasmid DNA extraction, we verified the presence of an insert by using Xba I and Hind III restriction enzymes (data not shown).We checked the presence of proteins in the fractions by SDS-PAGE.Enzymatic digestion by Xba I and Hind III followed by electrophoresis revealed the presence of the C2 insert.Therefore, we can conclude that our protein binds to cellulose.(B) Photography of membranes after the interactions were revealed.Right panel : binding profile for 50 kDa molecules.Then, we investigated whether our protein was able to catalyze the biosilification reaction.(B) Supernatant of lyzed bacteria was introduced through the column.We can explain this observation by the fact that it was difficult to wash patches since they a little brittle in full liquid shaking conditions.When OD600 nm was about 0.7, the culture was induced with IPTG at 0.3 mM (red arrow).Immunodetection of envelope protein of CHIKV within an excess of BSA (A) Principle of experiment.The detection method we designed was based on the conjugation of antigens with the Horse radish peroxydase enzyme HRP, and the capture of these conjugated antigens by specific antibodies.To do that, we drew inspiration for the 2011 Minnesota iGEM team and their work about Si4 to evaluate the silification process.Prediction of the influence of silification on the mechanical properties of the patchUsing the modeling approach described in the Protocols section (Patch mechanical properties modeling), we assumed that silica could increase by 48% the Young\u0092s modulus and by 75% the shear modulus of the patch.However, we have to be cautious about our model since we assumed that our protein is linear, which is not the case.We clearly observed a precipitation into the test tube, instead of the negative control (Fig.(D) Silification efficiency, calculated from C. Taken together, our results suggest that our fusion protein is able to bind to cellulose and to catalyze biosilification.Before silification, the concentration was 208 \u00b5g/ml.We eluted our protein using a gradient of imidazole-containing buffer, and two peaks were detected (Fig.By activating it in acidic conditions, we released the free silicic acid (Fig.Moreover, the rule of mixtures can be applied only when the two materials have the same Poisson\u0092s ratio, but we do not have any evidence of this for C2 and silified C2.It is a 25 kDa protein (Fig.The device is easy to use, safe and efficient in the detection of mosquito borne pathogen antigens.As negative controls, neither amplification was possible with a single primer (lanes 2, 3, 5, 6), nor in the absence of primers (lane 7) or DNA template (lane 8).Sample throughput in the system remains to be tested.Since the composite patch-protein was not completely assembled, we characterized the efficiency of our detection method by using commercial membranes of PVDF or nitrocellulose.Bacteria were grown on large scale (4 l), and we made a growth curve (Fig.The trap was subsequently materialized through the 3D printing process.We first tested the ability of our protein to bind to cellulose.The pellet also contains a lot of the dimers.to test the ability of our protein to bind to antibodies, require high amounts of antibodies (hundreds of micrograms), making the experiment too expensive to perform.Sequencing confirmed that it was the correct sequence.A better packaged version, with vertical flow could improve the fluidics and stability of the experiment.", "safety": "In our Mos(kit)o project, we used Escherichia coli (DH5-? and BL21(DE3) strains) as our chassis organism for protein expression, as well as specific protein domains, documented in the iGEM Parts Registry, and found in following species: Staphylococcus aureus protein A, cellulose-binding domain of Clostridium cellulovorans, and silica-binding domain from a published phage screen.Students are required to show their vaccination status, compatible for Institut Pasteur, before being allowed to enter lab and perform experiments.\u0095Security

part: BBa_K1028000).\u0095Since the silica-binding peptide (Si4), the cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein (CBPa), and the B domain of staphylococcal protein A are individually non toxic, we assume that the combination of them (newly iGEM 2016 deposited part: BBa_K2053002) will also be non toxic, although this remains to be tested in the lab.\u0095The silafin kinase TpsTK1

and operated during our research in the lab; including a fire drill conducted during the summer!The laws and regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories at the Institut Pasteur are ISO 15189 and ISO/CEI 17025.These biosafety levels are suitable for work involving potentially biohazardous agents to personnel and the environment.All lab work and experiments were done according to laboratory safety policy of the Institut Pasteur.All wastes were treated according to the disposal routes established for decontamination, and autoclavingFrom chemicals to electrical equipment, laboratories present a plethora of safety hazards, which is why it is so vital to understand the importance of lab safety.In order to make a silica-based vector-borne pathogens sensor, we will use this part as a binder of silicic acid to enhance biosilica formation and increase the rigidity of the cellulose-base matrix.The fusion protein, created by assembling these domains in different orders, or independently, is first produced by the bacteria in the laboratory, and then purified and incorporated into the biodetection patch.Based on the registry part sequence, we will perform gblock oligonucleotide synthesis (iGEM pre-existing part: BBa_K863110).\u0095The silica-binding domain from phage screen is able to condense silicic acid to form biosilica.Students were taught a course on common hazard and exposure risks in the lab, including chemical and biological hazards that are found at the Institut Pasteur research laboratories.The main safety aspects of our daily routine in the lab are the following:\u0095Personal safety: the experiments in the lab were done with gloves, safety glasses, closed leather shoes and lab coats.We do not require the whole protein, thus we will only use the antibody-binding domain of this protein: the B domain.Once complete, the patch and the mosquito trap are installed in the environment.\u0095 In Staphylococcus aureus, the protein A (BpA) binds to constant fragments of IgG antibodies in order to inhibit opsonophagocytosis, and might play a role as an adhesin during the initiation of intravascular infection by mediating attachment of S. aureus to proteins at the site of damage to the endothelium.Moreover, the coordination of cellulose enzymes by this protein is not a problem, because these enzymes are absent in humans.Secondly, the immuno-detection tests that required experiments with infected mosquitoes were conducted by one of our coaches, who has clearance for this level, in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.The training was performed by Dr Deshmukh Gopaul following guidelines from the Health and safety department of Institut Pasteur.Mosquitoes, rated pathogen-free, involved in the other experiments came from an insectarium in Institut Pasteur, none were taken from the environment.N.B: Since not all team members have had wet lab experience before, all the lab work was done under the supervision and guidance of at least one of our authorized senior team members and/or advisors.ISO 15189 is an international standard published by the International Organization for Standardization that specifies requirements for quality and competence particular to medical laboratories.In order to make a cellulose-based vector-borne pathogens sensor, we will use this part as a binder of a cellulose matrix.\u0095Not eating or drinking in the lab, nor storing food in areas where microorganisms are stored.ISO/CEI 17025, is a standard that specifies the general requirements for the competence of calibration and testing laboratories.We also searched for the existence of a kinase for improving the silification reaction from Thalassiosira pseudonana.This standard regarding any laboratory analysis and testing is the repository used during the accreditation audits.\u0095The laboratory supervisor must enforce the institutional policies that control access to the laboratory.They are quite abundant in the diatoms,

reactionsWe use the mass action kinetics because this type of equationonly requires one parameter for reaction and is less susceptible to overdosingBecause a major goal of the model is to predict the effects of the selection ofpromoters on the final production of violacein, we decided to find a way tocharacterize promoters first.A pseudocode of this model is provided here.Calculate the production and degradation rate of each molecule in the pathway from the concentration of reagents and parameters.Obtain the rate of change of each molecule based on the production and degradation rates.Solve the System of Nonlinear Equations at Steady StateSolve the system of nonlinear equations at steady state starting at an initial guess X0.Use the result as a new initial guess; repeat the numerical method to solve the system of equations again.Calculate the relative error of each chemical in the new result.If the maximum error is smaller than 0.0001%, output violacein concentration at steady state as the final result.Load the data from literature, which include the choice of promoter for each gene and the corresponding violacein yield determined experimentally.For each promoter selection scenario, pass the promoter types and the temporary parameters to the steady-state model.Obtain the violacein yield predicted by the steady-state model for each promoter selection scenario.Compute the residual sum of squares (RSS) of between the predicted violacein yields and the violacein yields given by experiment.Determine the optimal parameters by minimizing the RSS (least square method).Using the principles of mass action kinetics, we derived the system of ODE equations in the model.In the table, ki\u00ad (i = 1,2,3,4,5) are the production rate coefficients of promoter I (i = 1,2,3,4,5), and kd is the degradation rate coefficient of all promoters.After we finished the regression model of each promoter, we created a second model to describe the violacein biosynthetic pathway.The equation is shown below:In this equation, Ai is the concentration of enzyme i, ki\u00ad is the production rate of each enzyme i, kd is the degradation rate of all enzymes, and t is time.The experimental data from the literature are shown in the figure below (Jones et al., 2013).The first step of our model is to describe the rate of change of enzymes based on promoter strength.Here we assumed that the enzyme production rate is directly proportional to strength of the promoter.Before building constructs to use for violacein production, we needed to find a way to determine which promoters to use for the five genes involved in the pathway.Then, every enzyme has the same degradation rate.Moreover, we assumedthe degradation rate of proteins only depends on the growth rate of E.coli.Five parameters (kA, kB, kC, kD and kE) are related to the production rates of the five enzymes, which depend only the strength of the promoter type.Another parameter, kd, is the degradation coefficient of all molecules due to the growth of E.coli.As described in the pseudocode, we used least square regression to determine the optimal values of these parameters.Each one of the11 differential equations describes the rate of change of specific molecule in the system.By solving this equation, we derived the equation of enzyme concentration against time.Since we assumed that the promoter strength is proportional to the promoter concentration, we would use the equation to fit our data using least squares method (Fig.The equations consider the production, consumption, and degradation rates of the molecules.The colors indicate with which promoters the circles and lines correspond.In general, the regression lines are able to capture the change of strength of each enzyme over time.Therefore, the rate of degradation of a molecule depends on a degradation constant and the degradation coefficient.The bacteriophage T7 promoter has been widely used for protein expression and purification (Jones et al., 2013), so we used data of five mutant T7 promoters to create a proof-of-concept model.In addition to these known parameters, the equations include 11 undetermined parameters related to the reaction rates at specific steps in the violacein synthetic pathway.In this way, the parameters are determined.If this model was functional, we could implement the same modeling technique tothe promoters we were working with.The five mutant T7 promoters have distinct promoter strength over time after induction.Parameters realted to promoter strength and degradation of molecules.The degradation coefficient is identical for all molecules since it only depends on E.coli growth rate.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "Can cause eye and skin

(perfluorooctanoic acid).Due to strong binding energy of carbon-fluorine bond, these compounds are very difficult to be degraded in nature and they also accumulate in organism, causing harm to the environment and human.Since there\u0092s no regulation for banning PFCs usage and emission in most countries all over the world nowadays, environmental organizations, government and scientists have discovered liquid and volatile PFCs distribution in waters, in snow, in the air, and even in drinking water.Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), including PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooactanesulfonic acid), are hazardous man-made chemicals produced or used in industry and daily necessities.[3] PFOA, one of the most studied PFCs, has been detected in adults  bodies around

we hope to develop an efficient and eco-friendly method to keep the world from PFCs disaster.Our goal is to break carbon-fluorine bonds in PFOA.[7] Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident

concentration of PFCs in the liver.[2] In USA, Environmental Working Group (EWG) even showed statistics of PFCs pollution levels in every state.Hence, we assumed that fac-dex is the key to degrading PFOA.In the process breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released.Besides, tons of researches show that PFCs potentially cause diseases to animals and human.High concentration of PFCs have been detected in Pearl River and Yangtze River in China and some lakes in USA since 2007.We also insert a fluoride transporter gene, CRCB[9], to help our modified E.coli survive.There are two goals in our experiment: Degradation of PFOA and transportation of fluoride.What\u0092s worse, researches have suggested that PFOA is link to several disease.Groups of Scientists conducted researches on animals and found that animals which were fed with PFOA, end up with their thymus, spleens, and livers enlarged, possibly tumorous.FA1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens are able to degrade PFOA producing fluoride.[4] Because of its hydrophobicity, PFOA can stay in human body for a long time.", "design": "Meanwhile, escaping engineered bacteria will be killed for biosafety.As for PFOA bioremediation basin, we referred to the structure of current secondary treatment basin and set up a prototyping model.The best way to stop PFOA pollution caused by industrial wastewater is to remove PFOA in the wastewater before it is released into the environment.For the purpose of preventing PFOA from leaking to the enironment, we developed a bioreactor system.We designed a bioreactor and named it \u0093 PFOA bioremediation basin.\u0094 Following is a sketch of our reactor.To develop a more complete bioreactor system, we plan to integrate our own device, PFOA bioremediation basin, into the current industrial wastewater treatment process in the factory producing PFOA wastewater.First, wastewater passes through RO membrane, so that PFOA in the wastewater becomes more concentrated.Once the concentration of PFOA gets higher, the efficiency of our system can be lifted.Next, after some adjustments, such as PH value and temperature, to make the wastewater a proper environment for bacteria to grow, wastewater enters our device, PFOA bioremediation basin.After being processed in PFOA bioremediation basin, wastewater is added with calcium chloride solution of high concentration, so that fluoride, which is the predicted byproduct of PFOA degradation, can be precipitated.In addition, wastewater is set to stay in the basin for a period of time to undergo PFOA degradation performed by engineered bacteria.We apply computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to predict real situation of our project.", "human_practice": "Thanks to their help, we finally finished our provision before

completely inhibited.First, we cultured the BL21 overnight, and then added IPTG to induce Crcb, Bpe, Fluc expression.Second, we added different concentration of sodium fluoride (NaF) and used ELISA to detect the value of OD 600.We think that if Fluoride transporter work, the bacteria will grow better.Result: Compared with no plasmid control, we found a significant-different with 0.08M and 0.1M [NaF].Based on fluoride-concentration-time graph from sample of modified E.coli (BL21 with Fac-dex) and PFOA of 500 ppm initially, we can tell that the concentration of fluoride increases in time due to the performance of PFOA degradation.With the technic of SDS-PAGE, we can test if our plasmid can be expressed properly in E.coli or not.We separately induced 8 different E.coli culture that had be transformed the Fac-dex gene.From the growth curves, we found that PFOA has little influence on the growth of E.coli.In our experiment, after we transformed our plasmid into E.coli, we induced the expression of Fac-dex gene.After Fac-dex breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released, leading to the increase of fluoride concentration in waterTherefore, by detecting the fluoride concentration with Fluorine Ion Selective Electrode in time, we can know the extent of PFOA degradation by Fac-dex.Then the induced E.coli was transferred into new tube containing LB with different concentration of PFOA

gene is able to be induced, there should be a large quantity of Fac-dex existed in E.coli.We used the induced E.coli culture as our samples.BL21 with Fluoride transporter, grew better than control.Conclusion: First, the four figures show that if the environmental fluoride concentration increases, the bacteria which express fluoride transporter can growth better.It manifests that Fac-dex can successfully degrade PFOA and release fluoride.We inoculate starter culture at a 1:100 dilution into LB containing NaF with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.The result is as below?From the growth curve, we know that under 20mM of sodium fluoride, E.coli is able to grow normally.We cultured E.coli in liquid medium (3 ml LB and 5 ml E.coli broth) containing PFOA with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.Under 60mM of sodium fluoride, the growth curve shifted slightly.Our maybe because the amount of our engineered bacteria added in wastewater isn t many enough to work in such amount of wastewater.We also added Mg+2 as the cofactor of Fac-dex.From the result above, the F- released by PFOA degradation is not detectable

of countless human beings by controlling the population of both agricultural and urban pests, since the second half of last century, the numbers of insecticide resistant pests have been rising at an alarming rate [1].Though they might have succeeded in increasing the potency or hardiness of a fungus specie, they did not take a step further to consider that the evaluation the fungal insecticide must follow before commercialization, which includes the assessment of its toxicity towards humans and animals, dispersal, horizontal gene transfer rate, and its effects on the resident microflora [5].In reality, the amount of insecticides applied is actually proportional to the increase in resistance in the target pest population [2], [3].Some would argue that as researchers and chemical pesticide companies develop new insecticides, the resistance couldn\u0092t possibly catch up.Currently, the biopesticides that are the most widespread, in terms of usage, are the entomopathogenic-fungi insecticides[4].Using an entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, that is applied as an insecticide around the world as our chassis, we have constructed a genetically modified M. anisopliae with wildtype lethality and the additional ability to self-terminate after killing its host.1.nutrition and immune response) conditions [5].Many researchers have tried to improve these fungal insecticides through biochemical or genetic means [6], [7].This means if no action is taken to change the status quo, the ongoing population control of insect pest will become even more of a struggle.Biopesticides, including insecticidal plant extract, bacteria, and fungi, are some of the more popular alternatives to chemical pesticides.Reid, M.

selection marker gene bar BBa_K1021003.We characterized this part with thermal stability assay.KillerRed protein was extracted from transformed E.coli and a control group of empty vector was set to eliminate the influence of other proteins.This test aims to show the temperature influence on KillerRed protein by measuring its fluorescence after being treated for 2 hours at the following temperatures: 70, 70.5, 71.7, 73.5, 75.5, 78.3, 81, 83.6, 86, 88, 89.5, 92.2 (degree Celsius).", "design": "Utilizing PMcl1 from M. anisopliae, a promoter with fast activation and high production rate, high amounts of KillerRed protein with SV40 NLS will be produced and transported to the nucleus.Utilizing the promoter of PMcl1 in genetically engineering Metarhizium allows the expression of target genes to be limited to the hemocoel of the fungus  host insects, ensuring the specificity of gene expression[2].The KillerRed protein is a red fluorescent protein with excitation and emission maxima at 585 and 610 nm respectively.Through the utilization of different gene expression and location of M. anisopliae cells during different stages of its infection cycle alongside with light-induced phototoxic fluorescent proteins, we aim to design entomopathogenic-fungi-specific killswitch that can greatly mitigate the safety concerns of the genetic modified fungal insecticides in hope that it will increase the feasibility of wide spread use of these enhanced bioinsecticides.Here we show a short overview: The infection process of M. anisopliae is similar to other entomopathogenic fungi, i.e.This sets the mass production of KillerRed proteins to the hemolymph infection phase of M. anisopliae\u0092s infection cycle.Gisbert Zimmermann (2007): Review on safety of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae , Biocontrol Science and Technology, 17:9, 879-920.During M. anisopliae\u0092s stay within the hemocoel and other interior organs of the insect, KillerRed molecules will remain inert due to the lack of yellow light.The killswitch circuit contains the hemolymph-induced promoter, PMcl, followed by the KillerRed gene and a fungal terminator, TtrpC.This put fungal cells in direct contact with sunlight, allowing KillerRed to create reactive oxygen species like O2?-, which will disrupt the metabolic functions of the cells and eventually killing the fungi.This promoter controls the production of Metarhizium-collagen-like-proteins in wildtype Metarhizium anisopliae, the transcripts of the Mcl1 gene could be detected within 20 minutes of the fungus contacting the hemolymph, but could not be detected when the fungus is cultured in any other medium.However, chromatin is also a ROS-sensitive intracellular localization.So we designed to fuse a SV40 nuclear localization signal to KillerRed protein in order to increase efficiency of KillerRed-mediated oxidative stress.We designed our circuit to utilize the gene expression change of M. anisopliae to activate the production phase of our killswitch.When M. anisopliae depletes the nutrients in host s body, the fungus will emerge from the carcass of its host for conidiation.The increase concentrations of ROS in the cytoplasm disrupt normal cellular functions and impede fungal growth and, in the best case scenario, induce programed necrosis[5].KillerRed effectively killed bacterial cells when exposed to white light for several minutes.Structural Basis for Phototoxicity of the Genetically Encoded Photosensitizer KillerRed.In conclusion, our In-Out-Suicide system allows for more lethal genetically modified fungal pesticides to be developed because it provides them with a ability to clean up after itself, lowering their threat to the surrounding environment.the infection pathway consists on the following steps: (1) attachment of the spore to the cuticle, (2) germination and formation of appressoria, (3) penetration through the cuticle, (4) overcoming of the host response and immune defence reactions of the host, (5) spreading within the host by formation of hyphal bodies or blastospores, i.e.The following two ways have been found to be effective for killing the eukaryotic cells using KillerRed: (1) via an apoptotic pathway using KillerRed to target mitochondria, and (2) via membrane lipid oxidation using membrane-localized KillerRed.Proceedings

the engine\u0092s efficiency, and increased amounts of CO and soot emission (due to more unburnt C content in the exhaust now).Hence, cloning the SQR gene is important, as it will convert the toxic waste gas hydrogen sulfide to sulfur, which is a solid product and can therefore be separated out with ease.1.The biobrick BBa_K896000 (Sqr), previously submitted by NYMU iGEM 2012 team, was obtained from iGEM repository.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BBa_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.At high concentrations of Sodium nitrite, the OD values showed a sharp decline, which can again be attributed to high concentrations of nitrite (>2mM) being toxic to the cells.6.Nessler\u0092s test (LB growth)- Cultures of our clones were grown anaerobically in 5ml of luria broth, along with standard DH5? cells, used as control.NO is found primarily in motor exhausts, and Oxides of nitrogen (NOX) are key oxidants that have a role in the photochemical production of ozone, whilst also being linked with an increase in the oxidising capacity of the atmosphere.The nitrite reductase NrfA is encoded within the nrfA operon that is found in enteric bacteria such as E. coli.But most of the E-coli strains do not possess an efficient heme transport system and thus uptake of hemin solely relies on diffusion through the cell membrane.ChuA :It is basically a heme-transport protein which helps in utilisation of Hemin NADPH-sulfite reductase (SiR) of Escherichia coli catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide and is required for synthesis of L-cysteine from inorganic sulfateThe native enzyme has a subunit structure a8B4 , where a8 is a flavoprotein (SiR-FP) containing both flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide and P is a hemoprotein (SiR-HP) containing an Fe4S4 centre and a single molecule of sirohemeElectron flow between these cofactors proceeds from NADPH to flavin adenine dinucleotide to flavin mononucleotide in the flavoprotein, then to a closely coupled Fe4S4 siroheme center in the hemoprotein, and finally from siroheme to sulphiteThe SiR-FP and SiR-HP components of SiR are encoded by cysJ and cysl, respectively.Thus, if an efficient and cost effective design of this NRFA driven pollution crusader device is realized, it would bring about a remarkable change in the automobile and diesel engine industry, and increase the efficiency of these devices, while reducing both the cost, and carbon footprints on the environment.We were able to materialize our dream of designing the perfect \"Pollution Crusader\" prototype model, using the genetically engineered Eco.coli bacteria, to a very good extent, if not fully.From the viewpoint of Synthetic Biology, we succeeded in obtaining the desired clones.The reduction of nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen requires two protons and two electrons, according to the equationN2O + 2H+ + 2e? ? N2 + H2O, E\u00b0? (pH 7.0) = 1.35 V; ?G0? = ?339.5 kJ/mol This is a challenging reaction to be catalyzed by a metalloenzyme, as nitrous oxide is not just kinetically inert to decomposition but also a poor transition metal ligand, due to its weak ?-donating and ?-accepting properties.Although, there have been some reports of other enzymes, such as nitrogenase and a multicopper oxidase from Pyrobaculum aerophilum, able to catalyze this reaction in vitro, the only one, whose primary role is the reduction of nitrous oxide, is N2O reductase (NosZ) The general cloning strategy for P+RBS+NosZ+SYFP consists of the following steps.1.The biobrick BBa_K1866001 (NosZ+SYFP) was prepared by Team IIT Delhi iGEM 2015.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BB_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.These genes are contiguous and together with cysH, the gene for 3 -phosphoadenosine 5 -phosphosulfate sulfotransferase, comprise an operon with the gene order promoter-cysJ-cysI-cysHcysJIH operon is part of the positively regulated cysteine regulon (15) and requires sulfur limitationSiR activity is also dependent on cysG, which encodes a uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase necessary for the synthesis of siroheme This gene is located more than 10 min away from cysJIH on the chromosomal map (34) and is not tightly regulated as part of the cysteine regulatory 1.To characterise the Promoter + RBS + nrfA biobrick (Bba_K1866000), we first ran the total protein content of our recombinant E.coli DH5? culture (into which our pSB1A3 plasmid containing the biobrick had been cloned) on an SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel.The stereochemistry of heme attachment is the same in all known examples of heme c, and the vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are attached to the N- and C-terminal Cys of the CXXCH motif, respectively.Other, less common, derivatives of heme include heme d1, present in cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase, heme a, found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the related heme o, found in some bacterial oxidases.From a chemical perspective, hemes b and c are very similar to each other and thus are not expected to display significant inherent differences in electronic structure or reduction potential.In a nutshell, our prototype model is capable of removing the harmful soot particles, gases like NOx and SOx and also the particulate matter present in the exhaust gases of the various engines being used.This was a remarkable discovery as the NRFA bacteria we are working with, effectively reduce NO into harmless forms, and hence we needed NO as the output from this tank.This will also further reduce environmental repercussions as soot now is converted into a useful product, rather than being dumped into the environment To work on developing and optimizing the desooter tank design to reduce power consumption in the blower, as well as the heat exchanger.After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and the pH of the solution was taken for all different concentrations of Nitrite.One of the pathways to its destruction is reduction to molecular nitrogen by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase found in denitrifying bacteria.NosZ, a gene coding for nitrous oxide reductase, isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, is known to convert N2O to harmless Nitrogen gas (N2).After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and nessler\u0092s reagent was added to a 1ml aliquot.These OD values were plotted against DH5? culture, used as control for the experiments.a.Monitoring with time- For a concentration of 1mM Nitrite, multiple cultures were inoculated.The NrfA nitrite reductase is a membrane-associated respiratory enzyme that couples to the membrane-associated formate-oxidizing enzymes via quinones in order to generate membrane potential.The desooter tank has the following main design components: The exhaust gases enter the desooter tank at high temperature(200-250 C), and hence they cause the water in the tank to evaporate when they pass through it.Thus, the tank containing this solvent dissolves soot and NOx, Sox gases move out with the exhaust.The reason for this repression at high nitrite concentrations is the presence of two regulators of the nrfA gene, NarL and NarP, in the E.coli K-12 genome (from where this gene has been isolated).The OD values were more than that of DH5? cultures throughout, pointing to the fact that more ammonia was being formed in our clone cultures.b.Monitoring with different nitrite concentrations- 50 ml Cultures were inoculated with different concentrations of Sodium nitrite.Finally, we came to the conclusion that while expressing NrfA in a constitutive fashion, there was increased conversion of NOx to ammonia.The NirB nitrite reductase is a soluble siroheme-containing enzyme that uses NADH as an electron donor to reduce nitrite in the cytoplasm.Also, another important product of the reaction, NAD(P)+ act as reducing equivalents that are an inherent part of the electron transport system in the host.The nrfA gene is suppressed at higher levels of nitrite or nitrate.Under the constraints of time, we managed to compile the literature, designed the perfect strategy and using Copasi (modelling tool), we found some novel pathways to regulate and manipulate the increase in Heme production and hence the activity of the Heme proteins.It has two copper centers, a binuclear CuA center, similar to the one found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the CuZ center, a unique tetranuclear copper center now known to possess either one or two sulfide bridges[3].(P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.6.The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, whose atmospheric concentration has been increasing since the introduction of the Haber Bosch process led to the widespread use of nitrogenous fertilizers.The remaining exhaust, congaing NOx, Sox and some amount of water vapor now passes over the silica gel tank at the outlet of this desooter tank.SC-R\u0092s are not efficient enough, and thus, do not lead to a significant increase in the trade-off temperature.Nitric oxide (NO) is a proposed intermediate in the six-electron reduction of nitrite and NrfA can use exogenous NO as a substrate.It\u0092s a cross flow type heat exchanger, with which we did some slight innovations to increase the efficiency of the condensation process.Being an acid, it reduces the PH of the medium and hence decreases the solubility of acidic NOx and SOx, from the exhaust into this solvent.From a biosynthetic perspective, however, these types of heme are quite different; because heme c is synthesized from heme b, the use of heme c requires a greater investment from the organism.However, the overall reaction is given by:Thus, the six electron reduction of NO2- to NH3 is catalysed by the nitrite reductase nrfA.NOx sensors placed at the edge of the silica gel tube confirmed that the gel was catalysing the reaction that we intended to do, converting NO2 to NO.To optimize the design of the desooter tank and the entire contraption, to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the process.We tested the model against the exhaust emitted by a diesel engine.But the end product heme acts as a feedback regulator of ALA synthase thereby inhibiting its production.Incomplete heme incorporation into recombinant protein has been a frequently encountered problem .A population of protein will

increase heme incorporation into our proteins.We also saw that at concentrations of Nitrite greater than 2mM, the pH showed a sharp decline.Hence, a level meter is required to keep a check on the water level left in the tank, and hence supply fresh water accordingly through the fresh water inlet.While no intermediates of the reaction are released, NrfA is also able to reduce various oxides other than NO such as, hydroxylamine (H2NOH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), but notably also sulfite(SO32-), providing the only known direct link between the nitrogen and sulfur cycles.While scavenging the research papers, we found out that nobody, till date had found a perfect solution for the over expression of Heme protein.In the past, motor vehicle exhaust was an important, but not the main, source of sulfur dioxide in air.This experiment was also successful, with OD values showing a trend similar to the one above.1.The biobrick BBa_K1153001 (NrfA), previously submitted by KENT iGEM 2013 team, was obtained from iGEM repository.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BBa_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.The digestion products were resolved on an Agarose Gel by Electrophoresis and the size of the fragment confirmed the correct clone.The biggest problem which we encountered was that the heme synthesis was much less as compared to our overexpressed protein.The experiment showed results as expected, with the pH of our clones being higher than the control, which can be attributed to the presence of excess ammonia in the solution.For this, we attach a heat exchanger at the outlet of the tank.Escherichia coli possesses two biochemically distinct nitrite reductase enzymes encoded by the nrfABCDEFG and nirBDC operons.We did manage to extensively characterize the NrfA cloned gene, which served as the nitrate reductase.Nitrite, the substrate for the two enzymes, must either be encountered environmentally or generated by the cell from nitrate reduction by one of the three E. coli nitrate reductases.The initial plan was to clone this gene downstream of the CysI gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which codes for sulfite reductase, catalysing the conversion of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide (H2S).So we decided to eliminate soot and NOx as the primary objective.Research was done extensively and the following genes were found to be best fitting for our project-Since Nitric oxide NO is a major greenhouse gas, the reduction of NO from the air is an important task to address global warming concerns.To get rid of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, we decided to use a solution of acetic acid in water as the solvent.This could be due to the fact that high concentrations of nitrite (NO\u00ac2-) become toxic for the cells, due to which cell death occurs.The exhaust out of this tank is now passed into the desooter tank.Thus, the NO rich gas from this tank is passed into the next tank containing NRFA bacteria for further action.This was required so that these excess water vapor do not clog the silica gel at the outlet of the tank.After 16 hours of growth, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD Values were taken.However, we later realised that the pellet was not of our cells, but of ampicillin, which had formed some sort of white precipitate with the media.Conventionally, diesel engines are operated at temperature ranges which are not very high, as operation at high temperature leads to higher amount of NOx in the exhaust.This enzyme is a periplasmic protein and therefore contains a signal sequence to redirect it to the periplasmic space after the protein is formed.The result showed over expression in the range of 55 kDa, which is roughly equal to the size of our protein.2.Periplasmic protein SDS-PAGE\u0097following the over expression obtained from the Poly Acrylamide gel electrophoresis, we extracted the protein content from the periplasmic space using the periplasm fractionation protocol.While working in the project, towards the end, the main complexity we faced was of Heme protein.This culture was then centrifuged at maximum speed (13,400 rpm) for 10 minutes, and the media was decanted and dried out, leaving only the red ammonia pellet.154:349\u0096354 9.Optimization of the heme biosynthesis pathway for the production of 5-aminolevulinic acid in

J.At high nitrite concentrations, the pellet size reduced drastically (the reason being toxicity at high nitrite concentration).1.Clarke, TA., Mills, PC.We observed considerable reduction in the amount of NOx and SOx reduced.We further instigated the problem and found that one of the largest contributions to rising pollution in Delhi is the exhaust from automobiles and other devices using petrol and diesel as fuel.Use the soot (obtained as dissolved in water) to make ink to ultimately make the process self-sustainable and bring down the processing cost to negligible amounts by accounting for commercial selling of this ink obtained.Spargers are needed to form bubbles of exhaust gas in the mixture.The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur.The pathway of the nrfA Gene is still not completely understood or characterised.(P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.6.The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.We performed a double digestion by EcoRI and PstI to release the cloned fragment from the recombinant vector.These ball bearings, through conduction, cool down to acquire the temperature(similar to) of the flow pipes and hence increase the surface area available to the vapor for condensation, speeding up the condensation process.After regular intervals of time, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD540 values were noted.This was run on another polyacrylamide gel, and we saw over expression on this gel as well, on the appropriate range.3.Minimal media growth- Following a research paper by Clarke et al., a culture of our cloned E.coli DH5? culture was grown on a minimal media containing 5% Luria Broth (by volume), 40mM Potassium Nitrate, 20mM Fumarate and 0.4% glycerol for 16 hours, in anaerobic conditions.U.S. EPA then includes these sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) and targets them for federal clean-up activities.We have been successful in cloning a total of 5 relevant bio bricks:We have submitted these parts in the iGEM registry for future use by any iGEM team.U.S. EPA has found hydrogen sulfide in at least 35 of the 1,689 current or former NPL sites.Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) prosthetic groups perform a wide range of functions in nature includingHeme c: heme c has two covalent thioether bonds formed between Cys side chains and the heme vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 .Delhi has been ranked the first most polluted metropolis in the world, and is one of the most heavily polluted cities in India.In the mechanical half of the project, we designed a prototype which in effect served as the perfect \u0093Pollution Crusader\u0094.Blowers are also attached to the system to compensate for the back pressure generated in the system at each step.Cold water flows through the exchanger pipes and steam flows on the outside.In the period between 2000-2011, PM10 levels in Delhi s air jumped by as much as 47 per cent.While either NarL or NarP was able to induce nrfA-lacZ expression in response to low levels of nitrate, only NarL could repress at high nitrate levels.This problem could therefore, be solved, by expressing the nitrite reductase gene under a constitutive strong promoter, which is what we have done.The prototype model designed will not only serve as an alternative for the existing technology, but has the potential to bring revolutionary changes in the upcoming days.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the nation.We here filled the outside of the pipe portion of the exchanger with metal ball bearings.", "design": "", "human_practice": "iGEM team IIT Delhi put up a stall in this event with the goal to motivate and

Synthase) is the committed step of the heme synthesis pathway, and is usually rate-limiting for the overall pathway.As heme synthesis was our fundamental problem, we put on a lot of efforts in

Protein System into use on PETase, but, on the basis of the character of PETase degradation, our project has been extended.We have improved the function and characterization of two previously existing BioBrick Part which are created by our own team in a previous year of iGEM(BBa_K1582000&BBa_K1582001).Our particular desigin is shown as follows.Hydrophobin is a small molecular weight protein produced by filamentous fungi, which is characterized by the ability to form a layer of amphiphilic protein membrane at the interface in order to reverse the nature of the interface covered.Utilized amphiphilic and high temperature, acid and alkali resistance characteristics of hydrophobic protein, co-display the PETase and hydrophobic protein on the surface of eukaryotic cells helps in greatly improving the enzyme activity and broaden the reaction conditions of the enzyme.Surface display can improve the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and avoid the trouble of protein purification.This year, we focus on solving the white pollution problem.Due to its amphiphilic nature, the hydrophobic protein binds to the surface of yeast cells spontaneously and binds the hydrophobic surface toward the extracellular side, which adsorbs the PET film through the hydrophobic interaction force.The yeast cell wall is hydrophilic while the hydrophobic protein is hydrophobic.Besides, we used the hydrophobic protein to modify the surface of reaction system to increase its activity.Hydrophobin amphipathicity refers to the hydrophobic nature that the hydrophilic end of a hydrophobin.Frist and the foremost, researchers should analyze the three-dimensional enzyme structure and understand its characteristic for well-directed proceeding to the next section.After that, the system was separated into two parts to improve its activity.The next step has two paths, one is directed mutation, which site is chosen by analyzing the three-dimensional protein structure to find its functional domains, and the other is surface display.According to its self-characteristic, people will do targeted modify on the enzyme in order to an extensive application.We understood more deeply the problem we were facing to solve and how to put the thoughts into reality to solve the white pollution.This time, we put forward a new system about enzymology called Training Protein.", "human_practice": "During the May, we have invite five professors to our forums to discuss with us about our project ideas.Fortunately, a few companies committed to the value of our project and wanted to support us.These events change our way of thinking, and help us have more comprehensive conclusion.Not only do we focus on the future education, but also chasing for a better achievement of our project.And according to our accomplishment with Training Protein System, the value of modified PETase canbe explored more.The talking gives us confident about our project.The best situation is the used microbe can be treated with sterilization reagent, and the soil has already have fungi, it will not be affected.The discussion let us realized that our PETase is vital for environment protection, but its not enough.Then, Tianjin Naipu Technology Co., Ltd suggested that they can provide us some PET samples and we can also go to their factory for a visit.When talking about our project, the manager said that the PETase is one of the best ways of PET degradation.He advised us to sum up the main steps of our experiment and put it into reality.Having listened to the opinions of the experts, we can better our project.And the one who affect us most is Professor Yang from Tianjin University, who is one of the leading experts in structure biology in China.Finally we use the bottles into our experiment as a connection of the lab and the reality.To expand the thought of our project, we go talk with professors and went for visit.Before we leaving, manager gave us some PET samples (plastic films and bottles) as a present.All the professors are have a large stock of knowledge and gave us many useful advises.To test and verify the new system, we put it in use of PETase and finally confirm that the

up into a theory.The manager show us around and introduce the situation about the production, yield, the development of PET industry and so on.After a negotiations, opposite side promised us that we can go to their factory for a visit.After understand our main idea about PETase, the staff said, if our biological method is available, land using efficiency will be greatly accelerated.Additionally, we also harvest a lot of experience and deepen our understanding of our project when going out of school and contacting with workers and experts.During the event of looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained some sponsor fee from the society but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology.During the times, we are inspirited and come up with better ideas and results.In addition, some experts in companies talked with us very friendly and put forward useful suggestions for us although they did not provide financial support.It s believed that collecting the opinions and suggestions of some officials helped us to improve our project, making it more meaningful.We introduced the iGEM and our project to them and showed our sponsorship proposal in order to make them interested in our team, sponsor fees and provide experimental materials, technology support.", "modeling": "So we can get:According to our hypothesis, when the PET\u0095S is decompose into the reaction products there will soon be a new PET binding on the PET film, so in the whole reaction process, the amount of the PETS won\u0092t change at all, and we can get the differential equation being zero.and because of the assumptions as the reverse reaction rate is zero, so the constant valve of k6 is zero and the equation-14 can change into:The above differential equation is the final rate equation of the whole reaction process, and from the equation-15 we can see that the reaction rate is a constant, D. And the reaction rate constants were different at different PET concentrations and different PET films.As can be seen from the above reaction kinetics model, the whole reaction rate is a constant after reaching the adsorption equilibrium.Third, the effect of reaction area in the hydrolysis process can be well considered by taking the adsorption process into account.In this part, we choose the Langmuir isothermal adsorption equation to describe the first step in the reaction process, the combination of the PET film and the PET enzyme.We needn\u0092t to take the reaction rate of the first reaction equation into account because it has been calculated in the adsorption part and the differential equation of the remaining two reaction rate as follows:so the following equation can be gotten by putting the relationship equation of the concentration of PET\u0095S and the PET film\u0092s area into the above differential equation:And combine the above equation and the equation of dimensionless Langmuir adsorption equation, we can get: Now, let\u0092s analyze the parameters of the above equation.There are three reasons we choose two steps, adsorption and reaction, to describe the process of PET enzymatic hydrolysis reaction: First, the adsorption process has a greater impact on the PET enzymatic hydrolysis process which we can\u0092t ignore.The general adsorption image of this equation in a typical solution is shown in picture 1:Here we assume that the PET enzyme adsorption process in accordance with the adsorption process in the picture above.It\u0092s used in this situation as well, so the double reciprocal equation is:So if we have the experimental data by experimenting with quartz crystal microbalance to detect the adsorption capacity of PET, we can get the constant ?max and Ka through the equation above.b. Schematic diagram of the combination of the PET enzyme and reaction products while the hydrolysis reaction is happening.When the enzyme adsorbed on the PET film is released after the reaction, a new PET enzyme will be adsorbed on the PET immediately from the picture 2, so the adsorption equilibrium is not broken.At last, the third step is the hydrolysis reaction and the three-step reaction equations as follows:In the above equation, the meaning of each symbol represents as follows: PET\u0095S: The middle state of PET enzyme adsorption on the surface of PET sheet.In order to apply this equation to solve the reaction kinetics problem well, some assumptions are given follows: B.The adsorption of PET enzyme on the PET-solid-surface is monomolecular layer.While, in fact, the product of the hydrolysis reaction, BHET and MHET shown a competitive inhibition of the hydrolytic activity of PET enzyme against PET sheet, which would decrease the free concentration of free enzyme in the solution according to Markus Barth.And through this reaction rate equation we can get different reaction rate in the condition of different PET film and PET enzyme initial PET enzyme concentration.In our case, in order to predict the optimum condition of recombination cell decomposing PET, it was carried out the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis model.In this way, we put the Langmuir adsorption equation linked with the second step of hydrolysis reaction process, here, the equation above is the key to connect the two step, and the valve of the CPET\u0095S will be used in the next part.Because the reaction time relative to the adsorption time is so long that the time to achieve the adsorption equilibrium can be negligible, while, after reaching the maximum adsorption quantity, new PET enzyme will be adsorbed on the PET sheet soon whenever there is some PET enzyme reaction with PET to release the products.It\u0092s obvious that K, k3, Ka are constant in the system, while, in a fixed experiment, the area of the PET sheet and the concentration of the PET enzyme are unchangeable according to hypothesizes above, so the right part of the equation above is a constant, B.There are three main steps in the whole process on the basis of the given assumptions above, the first step is the former part which describes the adsorption process and the second step is the effective combination for enzyme catalytic reaction of the PET film and the PET enzyme on the basis of the physical adsorption.So the valve of the character, B, is not a constant because the valve of the concentration of PET enzyme, Ef, is changeable with the reaction time.D.The adsorption process of PET enzyme on the PET-solid-surface will come a dynamic equilibrium after a certain time.It\u0092s known that the general enzymatic reaction rate is far faster than diffusion rate, so, in this process, the hydrolysis reaction is very important as well as the diffusion adsorption process.As we all know, the symbol C means the concentration of the material, so we can get that CPET\u0095S is the concentration of the adsorption combination state of the PET film and the PET enzyme; CPETS is the concentration of the effective combined of the PET film and the PET enzyme; CS is the concentration of the free PET enzyme in the solution and CDTP is the concentration of the product, dimethyl terephthalate.So we can get:The parameter valves can be given according to the literature and experimental data:So the image of the reaction rate with the time under the condition of the A=28.27mm2, and E0=4\u00d710-3 is shown in the picture 3.Picture 3: The image of the reaction rate with the time.From the picture above, we can get that the reaction rate will decrease with the time because of the reaction products\u0092 prohibition.Here, we use the character PET\u0095S represent the middle state of PET enzyme adsorption on the surface of PET sheet.It avoid the solving process of the ?max needing the adsorption experiment by quartz crystal microbalance which would cost a lot of time.The model of PET enzymatic hydrolysis process is made up of two parts.E. The enzymatic reaction is carried out only on the solid surface of the PET sheet, and the PET enzyme won\u0092t enter the interior of the PET, and the solubility of the PET in the solution is zero.According to Markus Barth, we can know that the products such as: TPA, MHET, EG and BHET have a competence of combining with the PET enzyme, what\u0092s more, MHET and BHET are powerful in this.According to the Langmuir theory, the adsorption isotherm equation is:In the above equation, ? is the quality of PET enzyme adsorption by unit quality PET, g; ?max is the maximum adsorption of PET enzyme by unit quality PET, g; Ka is the adsorption dissociation constant, mL/g; Ef is the concentration of free PET enzyme in the solution, g/mL.In general, we use the double reciprocal method to find the adsorption constant of the Langmuir equation.Figure1 is a surf picture of our model, while Figure2 is a slice picture for our convenience in observing the details.Figure4: 4-D surf picture of Relative Enzyme ActivityFigure 5: 4-D slice picture of Relative Enzyme ActivityWe established the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis model established based on experimental data and find the mathematical expression of the efficiency of recombination cell decomposing PET.But the reaction rate shouldn\u0092t be a constant according to our experimental results in the whole process which indicates that the reaction products has a certain effect on the process.While it\u0092s no time for us to do so many adsorption process experiments, so it\u0092s the other way we need to seek in order to solve the reaction kinetics problem well.While the combination of the PET enzyme and the products reduces the PET enzyme concentration in solution which moves the adsorption equilibrium to deduce the maximum adsorption capacity and equilibrium adsorption capacity.This isothermal adsorption equation is suitable for the case where there is only one adsorbed species, while the PET adsorption process is just this one.So the concentration of this PET\u0095S can be achieved through the following equation:While in the above equation, K is a constant connecting the three characters and A represents the area of the PET film.And as we always know, the maximum adsorption capacity is certainly proportional to the area of the PET film, so the concentration of the combination state of the PET enzyme and PET film in the whole system is related to the PET film area and dimensionless adsorption capacity.D. The time to achieve the equilibrium of the adsorption reaction can be ignored.In this model, only the PET enzyme binds to the PET sheet and the PET is insoluble in the solution.DTP: The main product of PET hydrolysis, dimethyl terephthalate.According to combining the Langmuir equation and the reaction rate equation we get a heterogeneous kinetic model.The illustration is shown below by picture-2:Picture 2:a.The state of the adsorption without hydrolysis reaction happened.So the valve of the constant ?max and Ka is not wanted if we can get the reaction kinetics equation finally through another way.We set three variables as the reaction conditions in our model, which are the time(x1) and temperature(x2) of protein-induced expression and the cell concentration(x3).k1-6: The reaction constant of each reaction equation.So the kinetic equation eventually needs to be corrected which we will cover in the next section.In this part, our goal is to deduce the chemical reaction rate.So the Langmuir adsorption equation can be converted into the next form:The maximum adsorption capacity of the solution will be avoided by using this model.C.No intermolecular forces between the PET enzyme molecules.Here we only consider the main obstacles, BHET and MHET, even though we ignore these by-products because they are so few, but their influence on the adsorption can\u0092t be excluded.We can get that when it\u0092s 18 hours later, the reaction rate is zero which is in accordance with the experimental results that when we extend the reaction time the products won\u0092t increase.Effect of hydrolysis products on the enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate nanoparticles by a polyester hydrolase from Thermobifida fusca.The change of the area of the PET sheet

data of one experiment group we used is shown in table2.Table 2: Relative Enzyme Activity of E-coli with INP(ice nucleation protein)The results of our model are as follows.The reverse reaction rate is assumed to be zero as the quality of cis-reaction products is negligible compared to the amount of solution due to the slow cis-reaction rate.We consider that the reaction efficiency correlates with the protein-induced expression time logarithmically, and correlates with the temperature of protein-induced reaction and cell concentration quadratically.", "notebook": "Cultivation of PETase in

the  Our goal is to design a filter containing E. coli that will break down methanol to biomass (fructose-6-phosphate) with the following reaction: Using the enzyme complex soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).The Braunschweig team used with the chaperones GroES, GroEL and TF to help fold the different MMO proteins.Our team wants to engineer E. coli so that it can break down methane by cloning and expressing the sMMO of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath).The sMMO operon of M. capsulatus (Bath), figure 1, has ten known protein encoding genes, summarized in Table 1.Our team wants to engineer E. coli in order for it to break down methanol to biomass by cloning and expressing the genes methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) Hps and Phi are both part of the fixation phase of the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway and convert formaldehyde to hexolose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate respectively .Since methanol, the breakdown product of methane, is poisonous, we will also implement the Ribulose-Monophosphate (RuMP)- pathway from Bacillus methanolicus to convert methanol to biomass in three steps.Since we want to clone the genes that form the enzyme complex sMMO and use them to construct our own sMMO operon for expression in E. coli, the genes mmoQ, mmoS, and mmoR are not relevant and thus excluded from our project.Figure 1: sMMO operon of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath)adapted from Scarlan et.Characterization of MMOD, a long overlooked component of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).cloned the sMMO genes of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath) for the purpose of expressing them in Escherichia coli (E. coli).The two iron ions, the electrons (which change the iron ions), and the oxygen together with methane in the center of MMOH (bound to MMOB) make the magic happen to break one C-H bond in methane to a C-OH.To date there are two enzyme complexes known that can do the task of breaking methane; soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO), and the membrane bound particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO)1\u00963.15, 205\u009656 (2015).Cs\u00e1ki, R., Bodrossy, L., Klem, J., Murrell, J.

Involvement of MmoR and MmoG in the transcriptional activation of soluble methane monooxygenase genes in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b.It is in this diiron center of MMOH where the actual conversion of methane to methanol takes place.At low copper levels however, sMMO is expressed which uses iron-ions in the enzyme core for breaking methane.2\u00964 The methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (M. capsulatus (Bath)) is one of the most studied methanotrophs that has both pMMO and sMMO.Both enzymes break methane with the following reaction: Other than that they both can convert methane to methanol and require oxygen for the process, are they structurally very different.MMOG is thought to be a chaperone which will properly fold the sMMO proteins.More technical information about the specific functions of each sMMO subproteins after the summary.sMMO is build out of 5 proteins, whereof MMOX, MMOY, MMOZ form one protein complex called MMOH.MMOH, the hydroxylase, consist of three subunits ?

(19.8kDa), encoded by mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ2.Nerveless the different variance found within the other two phases of the RuMP cycle can all be expressed in E.coli too.The surrounding air will be pumped through the filter so the methane gas can be taken up by E. coli and be converted to biomass.All enzymes needed for the serine cycle, except three are present in E. coli.pMMO is expressed at high copper levels, which makes sense as it uses copper in the core of the enzyme to break the strong C-H bond in methane.Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and is leaked into the atmosphere at different natural and industrial places.Afterward helps MMOC to release methanol and resets MMOH by providing new electrons1,3.Figure 2: Overview of the sMMO protein with subunits ?,?, and ? of MMOH, and MMOB, MMOD, and MMOR.There is not much known about the function of the 12 kDa protein MMOD, formerly known as orfY.al 2009Six of the other seven genes, mmoX, mmoY, mmoZ, mmoB, mmoC, and, mmoD, encode the proteins of the sMMO complex.One aspect is that serine does not utilize formaldehyde directly, but it is added into the cycle in order to form serine.Determination by X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Fe-Fe separation in the oxidized form of the hydroxylase of methane monooxygenase alone and in the presence of MMOD.Compared to the serine cycle the RuMP cycle only needs two additional genes added to E.coli compared to the serine cycle that needs three.Even better, the enzyme  that these methanotrophs use can breakdown methane at ambient temperatures and pressure.6-9Thus if we could understand and use this enzyme it would be possible to develop tools to minimize the methane leakage at many places like barns and gas hydrates.Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde in all aerobic methylotrophes by the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase (Medh).Previous studies have shown that the most relevant pathway for this project are the RuMP pathway and the serine cycle.Methanol is an one carbon structure that is toxic to the cell.MMOD, encoded by mmoD, is thought to inhibit the process by blocking the binding of either MMOB or MMOC to MMOH.The last gene, mmoG, encodes for the protein MMOG, is not previously been uses in a iGEM project.In this step three enzymes have to be added in E. coli in order to go from methanol to fructose-6-phosphate; methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi).In another iron monooxygenase, Bacterial binuclear iron monooxygenases, a similar protein as MMOG called mimG was needed for proper folding of one of the other monooxygenase proteins6.Further studies are needed to resolve the functionality of MMOD both in vitro and in vivo.The mmoG gene is suggested to encode a GroEL-like chaperone that contributes to the correct folding of the other sMMO proteins5,6, but this is so far not proven.The first group showing that MMOD is expressed in M. capsulatus (Bath), also has evidence that MMOD can bind to the hydroxylase MMOH7.A big part of the industrial methane emission is in the agricultural sector in places like Gas hydrates are trapped ice-like crystals of gas that are only stable in a specific temperature and pressure range.& Sugimoto, S. Bacillus subtilis yckG and yckF Encode Two Key Enzymes of the Ribulose Monophosphate Pathway Used by Methylotrophs, and yckH Is Required for Their Expression.In addition will we clone the mmoG gene of the sMMO operon which is thought to encode a chaperone (MMOG) involved in folding of the other MMO proteins5,6.Nature 523, 534\u00965 (2015).Liikanen, A., Silvennoinen, H. & Karvo, A. Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in two coastal wetlands in the northeastern Gulf of Bothnia, Baltic Sea.* Formaldehyde to hexulose-6-phosphate with the enzyme 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (hxlA)* Hexulose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate with the enzyme 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (hxlB)  A closed container to restrict the genetically modified E. coli.A third gene, mmoR, encoding the protein  MMOR , is a transcriptional activator of the whole sMMO operon3\u00965.Two genes, mmoQ, and, mmoS, coding for the proteins MMOQ and MMOS can sense copper and play a role in regulating transcription of the sMMO operon3\u00965.Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) are the two enzymes involved in the fixation phase.They did show that MMOG (and  MMOR ) are required for protein binding to the promoter region of the sMMO operon in the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b5.However, the oxidation can occur in two different pathways.Biochemistry 54, 2283\u009694 (2015).Sazinsky, M. H. & Lippard, S. J. Methane monooxygenase: functionalizing methane at iron and copper.Medh2 was therefore found to be the best candidate of the three to use in this project2.Or even better, one could convert methane to methanol or biomass so it can be more easily transported and used as a bio-fuel instead of being discarded.Hps and Phi are found in most methylotrophes, but different methylotrophes have different genes involved in the cleavage and rearrangement phase.So that the PPQ biosynthetic pathway has to be cloned into E.coli or PPQ has to be added to the growth medium.The other pathway to consider is the serine pathway.It seems that MMOD binds to MMOH in competition with the regulatory protein MMOB, which hints to an inhibitory function of MMOD7.Examples of non-orthologs pathway are ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, the tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathway, and the gluthione-linked pathway.That is why we want to implement MMO into Escherichia coli (E. coli) so that it can breakdown methane.Sazinsky, M. H. & Lippard, S. J. Methane monooxygenase: functionalizing methane at iron and copper.These bound subunits form again a dimer, resulting in ?2?2?2, with in the middle a  canyon .On each of the ??? subunits is a binding site for either MMOB, the regulator, or MMOC, the reductase2.Binding of MMOB to MMOH is needed for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation (the actual breaking of the C-H to C-OH bonding)2.The group of microorganism that has the ability to grow with only a one carbon compounds as the single carbon source are called methylotrophes1.MMOC transfers the two electrons from NADH to the diiron site in MMOH2.The goal of this final step is to break down methanol to biomass, so E. coli can utilize methanol as an energy source.Preparation and X-ray structures of metal-free, dicobalt and dimanganese forms of soluble methane monooxygenase hydroxylase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).The NAD-linked cytoplasmic enzyme was therefor chosen because only one additional gene is needed and it utilizes the electron acceptor already found in E. coli.However, there is no known activation enzyme or sufficient flux for the process of condensation of formaldehyde2.What this means is that only two additional genes, Hps and Phi, have to be added to E.coli in order for RuMP cycle to perform its function.PLoS One 8, e59188 (2013).Ochsner, A. M., M\u00fcller, J. E. N., Mora, C.

actively engaged in (media) outreach.To get a better idea of the actual feasibility of implementing our filter, should it work, we set out to tour the facilities of relevant industries and discover how our filter system could be of use.It is imperative in fields such as synthetic biology to inform the public, as to which fears are overblown or without merit while constructively directing the attention of the public to areas of real risk.Some of the industrial areas of interest that were immediately obvious to us were; landfills (some of which reside in closed air spaces), sewage treatment facilities, and cattle farms.We have devided our activities under the categories Our project was inspired by the possibility of capturing methane emissions in facilities where methane is produced, and converting this methane into a useful product.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "", "protocol": "The amount of formed NADH can be measured at a wavelength of 340 nm.The formation of NADH is proportional to the amount of methanol converted into formaldehyde.To get a hint about the background in our reaction we established two controls:  E. coli strain expressing MEDH2 but methanol was not added to the assay reaction In a second approach we wanted to determine the in vivo activity of heterologous expressed MEDH2 in E. coli.During the conversion of methanol into formaldehyde NAD+ is used as a cofactor, leading to the formation of NADH.Protein expression under control of a T7 promoter can be induced by adding Isopropyl-?-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG).Figure 1: Schematic overview of the pET28a or pET30a vector with a T7 promoter, a ribosomal binding site (RBS) followed by our gene of interest.With PCR we added restriction enzyme sites at the 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 end of CDS of each gene.The codonoptimized mmoG as well as all three genes encoding the enzymes for the methanol to biomass conversion (medh2, hps, and phi) were created as The CDS of the hps gene, encoding the 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase, contains PstI and XbaI restriction sites making it not compatible with the BioBrick system.The concentration of formaldehyde is proportional to the concentration of DDL, which can be calculated using the Beer\u0096Lambert law.Instead mmoG was synthesized by IDT as a gBlock gene fragment, codon optimized for protein expression in E. coli.The second project part had the intention to create four new basic BioBrick parts.During the conversion of methanol into formaldehyde NADH is generated.The production of NADH can be measured at a wavelength of 340 nm.Figure 1:Schematic overview of in vitro assay of NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase.Thereby the Beer\u0096Lambert law can be used to calculate the concentration of NADH which corresponds to the concentration of produced formaldehyde.Imidazole is an organic compound and replaces the tagged protein in the interaction with the Ni-NTA chelate complex.To characterize the functionality of the NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase (medh2) two different approaches were chosen.Formaldehyde will react with components in the Nash reagent to form 3,5-Diacetyl-1,4-Dihydro-2,6-Lutidine (DDL.In the presence of formaldehyde it leads to the formation of 3,5-Diacetyl-1,4-Dihydro-2,6-Lutidine (DDL).Genes encoding the enzymes for the conversion of methanol into biomass (medh2, hps, and phi) were amplified by PCR from Bacillus methanolicus (MGA3) genomic DNA and TOPO blunt end cloning into the pCR4 vector was performed.By detecting the absorption at 412 nm, the formation of DDL can be measured.In two rounds of in vitro mutagenesis both restriction sites were removed and hps was cloned into pSB1C3 and submitted as a Before assembling the final constructs we wanted to show that each individual protein could be expressed in E. coli.Afterwards the gene was cloned either into pET-30 or pET-28 with the use of the listed restriction enzymes.Furthermore it is necessary to show if the heterologous expressed proteins are soluble expressed and not aggregated into inclusion bodies.Primers were designed in a way that they bind in the 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 untranslated region (UTR) of each gene.TOPO blunt end cloning of mmoG did not succeed.Aggregation in inclusion bodies prevents a proper folding and thereby proper function of the protein.Those basic parts consist of the coding sequences (CDS) of a gene.Addition of imidazol removes the polyhistidine tagged protein from the chelate complexe.For the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) we

wanted to show particular protein expression of each subunit into E. coli.We made hps compatible to the BioBrick system removing a XbaI and PstI restriction site by in-vitro mutagenesis and generated a basic BioBrick part (BBa_K1619002) .These BioBricks contain the original genomic sequences of medh2, hps and phi.We expressed MEDH2 in E. coli and purified the enzyme.Figure 5: Sequencing of hps

Zurich, Switzerland.", "background": "", "description": "bacteria that is able to respire its excess electrons through electrodes),  and since PET is a polymer that contains a large amount of energy in its carbon-carbon bonds,  excess energy released by our engineered P. putida from terephthalate degradation will be harnessed and utilized in a microbial fuel cell (MFC),  leading to an efficient and energy producing, rather than consuming, degradation of PET.In order to achieve symbiosis between our two chosen bacterial species we have separated them using a dialysis membrane so that the E. coli, secreting the LC-Cutinase and utilizing ethylene glycol is enclosed and separated from the P. putida which is utilizing the terephthalic acid that diffuses out of the dialysis bag.Their mutual dependence depends on the fact that terephthalate will be the sole carbon source for P. putida s growth, and cannot be generated in the absence of E. coli secreting LC-cutinase, while E. coli will not survive in elevated levels of terephthalate, that has to be degraded by P. putida, thus engineering a symbiotic dependence between the two bacterial species.Our goal is to genetically engineer P. putida so it will contain two plasmids which will encode for two essential components: a membrane transporter that will carry the terephthalate molecule into the cell and the necessary genes for its degradation.We plan to insert a degradation pathway for terephthalate into P. putida using genetic engineering, while the other monomer of PET, ethylene glycol, is utilized by E. coli that secretes our improved LC-Cutinase protein.The terephthalate degradation pathway, derived from a strain of Commamonas testosteroni , terminates in protocatechuate, a toxic molecule for most bacteria, however, P. putida, is able to utilize it as a carbon source for its growth (Jimenez et al 2002).LC-Cutinase is an enzyme discovered from an unknown organism in leaf-branch compost, and has been found to be one of the most efficient enzymes in breaking down PET polymers with relatively high crystallinity into degradable products, the monomers ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.This way, we hope to achieve a full degradation of the two PET products and with it to drive the PET biocatalysis reaction by LC-Cutinase forward.This energy can be utilized in a future device for the maintenance of growth conditions or the pretreatment of PET to render it easily degraded by the engineered bacteria.We have chosen to work with P. putida, which is a gram-negative bacterium, for its diverse metabolism, including the ability to degrade organic solvents, especially protocatechuate, a toxic substance for most bacteria, its similarity to E. coli in most laboratory protocols and its electrochemical properties which allow it to be used in our fuel cell.Based on the LC-Cutinase structure that was solved in 2014 (Sulaiman et al 2014), we have chosen to use a rational mutagenesis approach for its improvement.We decided to achieve this by genetic engineering of metabolic pathways of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida (P. putida).The ethylene glycol degradation pathway, present in our chosen E. coli strain, BL-21, supplies a carbon source for its growth while degrading PET to its respective monomers with LC-Cutinase.The two bacteria will metabolize the two PET degradation products - leading to the conversion of PET to CO2.In addition, current solutions for the disposal of PET, such as recycling and burying are also energy consuming as they require means such as transportation,  sorting and initial processing.Many ideas were considered in dealing with plastic waste such as burning plastic or burying it, but these solutions are considered damaging to the environment due to plastics toxicity.In addition, the pelB leader sequence was fused to the enzyme in its N terminus and was expressed and secreted to the growth media of E. coli.Next, we wanted to fully degrade the resulting monomers to CO2, this way no toxic molecules will remain as products of the degradation process.With the advancements made in the field of polymer chemistry during the 20th century,  many new polymers were introduced into industry and are known to us today as Polystyrene, Polyethylene and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET).Since the introduction of plastics, some microbial communities or species have evolved to successfully degrade plastics, however,  from an evolutionary point of view, probably due to the relatively short period of exposure to plastics,  they are yet to be efficient in plastic biodegradation.However, one of its best features was found to be one of its greatest drawbacks, the durability of plastic makes it virtually non-degradable.Using this approach, we made various mutations using an algorithm developed by Dr. Sarel Fleishman of the Weizmann Institute of Science (Goldenzweig et al.In order to offer a better alternative to the existing solutions we decided to explore options which would allow us to maintain a positive energy balance.Our goal as the Ben-Gurion University IGEM team of 2016 is to overcome this evolutionary hurdle by devising several approaches using synthetic biology tools for efficient plastic biodegradation.Genomic analysis of the aromatic catabolic pathways from Pseudomonas putida KT2440.", "design": "To provide us with a versatile vector, that will allow excision of a specific sequence from the designed insert if needed,  we added a restriction site between each element (gene or RBS).M259F - A \u0091hole\u0092 inside the protein core could be destabilizing to the protein structure.E. coli strain MG1655 was used for cloning of the LC-Cutinase genes into the pACYC vector backbone.Our chosen approach utilized a dialysis membrane with a cut-off of 12-14kDa, which is lower than LC-Cutinase s molecular mass, to enable the diffusion of the PET degradation products outside the bag for utilization by P. putida, while enabling a large concentration of LC-Cutinase inside the bag for efficient degradation of PET.Here are a few examples of mutations present in our mutated variants: A249P - Proline (shown in yellow) is added to increase the rigidity of the protein structure.Based on the structure of LC-Cutinase, we decided to use a rational mutagenesis approach, in which we introduce various mutations to the enzyme s sequence.In order to build a self-sustaining system in which part of the energy from PET could be utilized to make clean energy, we  We chose a bacterium

team (Part:BBa_K936013) and was amplified using primers containing restriction sites that match the pACYC backbone.Shredded PET was added to the dialysis bag and a magnetic stirrer was used to prevent precipitation.The algorithm uses the following steps in selecting the mutations: A sequence alignment was generated between the target wild-type sequence and other homologous sequences, from which several mutations were chosen.The restriction site had to be unique to avoid digestion of the genes or the vector backbone.Flanking each insert we designed and added homologous sequences to the desired target vector (224 or 434), for cloning with the NEBuilder\u00ae HiFi  DNA Assembly Cloning Kit.The flanking sequences also contained restriction sites for cloning into the multiple cloning site(MCS) of each vector.The mediator\u0092s formal potential should be adequate to the enzyme potential.We decided to use protocatechuic acid as it is part of the terephthalate metabolic pathway, which enables us to reduce the use of external reagents and to create a self-sustaining system.Containing 3 genes from C. testosteroni strain KF-1 for the transport of Terephthalic acid from the periplasmic  The genes involved in the Terephthalate degradation pathway and transporter were acquired from the Darmstadt iGEM team, 2012.Each mutant\u0092s structure was compared to the wild-type structure,  and the energy difference between them was calculated (??Gcalc).Containing 4 genes from the same strain of C. testosteroni for the degradation of Terephthalic acid to Protocatechuic acid \u0096 tphA1, tphA2, tphA3, tphB.At first, we examined the possibility of adding an electron carrier to the fuel cell,  as it was shown to be effective in enhancing the MFCs performance and was demonstrated using this species.We have chosen the pSEVA plasmids because they have been previously used in the P. putida KT2440 strain by the laboratory of Prof. D. Taufik at the Weizmann Institute.", "human_practice": "As an initial step to solve the plastic waste problem, we read the literature, learned what have already been done and met with several experts in different aspects of plastic waste:Prof. Alex Sivan, a scientist from the Ben-Gurion University who is an expert in microbial degradation of plastic waste.After learning about the LC-Cutinase, and making a comprehensive research about its properties we decided to focus on improving its PET degrading activity.Next, we consulted Dr. Sarel Fleishman, a scientist from Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, who is expert in computational protein design to improve enzyme activity.Finally, we aimed to learn about the current solutions for plastic waste.With the acquired knowledge, the magnitude of damage of plastic waste, and it became clear to us that we must find an effective and fast solution to deal with this problem.We also contacted Prof. Dan Tawfik and Dr. Halim Jubran from the Department of Bimolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, who provided the P. Putida KT 2440.In addition we met Prof. Amir Aharoni and Dr. Shimon Bershtein, two scientists from our university who are expert in protein engineering who study and improve complex biological processes.By visiting at Aviv recycling company, we saw and learned the process of plastic recycling \u0096 from the arrival of the plastic bottle to the plant to its reduction into raw plastic material made for the creation of other products.Finally, we discussed our plan and the project s design with our PIs concluding the valuable information to start wet lab work on our project.Furthermore, we done a comprehensive investigation of plastic s implications in order to learn and be able to raise awareness of the plastic hazard.Throughout the project, we met experts from the industry who utilize plastic in its raw state - Coca-Cola Company, Genome compiler and many more.We have learned about plastic s convenient properties such as flexibility, rigidity and lucidity that make plastic a popular raw material in the industry.Discovering that the current recycling process produces plastic waste that is not recyclable was eye opener, as it emphasizes the unmet need for biodegradation of plastic waste.One of the most interesting and important things we have learned is that 99% of the recycled raw plastic material is being used for products that cannot be recycled again.We consulted Prof. Sivan about our approach to a new solution for plastic degradation and learned that LC-Cutinase is an enzyme that is known for his ability to break PET bonds into two monomers: ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "The results show significant raising in the absorption but we didn\u0092t succeed to detect the TPA.The reasons why we didn\u0092t succeed to detect TPA can be contamination of the medium with another carbon source or maybe because we didn\u0092t filter the samples so there are some materials that can cause quenching

expressing LC-CutinaseCharacterizing E. coli growth inside a dialysis bag Characterization of the co-culturing of E. coli and P. putida - a controlled symbiotic approach Detection of TPA in plates containing PET and E. coli using fluorescence The bacterium Rhodococcus ruber R. ruber, known to utilize polyethylene (PE) as a carbon source, was grown in various liquid growth media with and without amino-acids and containing PE or PET pellets for a period of 30 days.Examining the utilization of PET by E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase In order to test the PET degradation ability of the LC-Cutinase enzyme variants, all variants were grown on M9 minimal medium plates with shredded PET pellets as a sole carbon source to test their ability to degrade PET.As seen from the results, our E. coli was able to grow with only PET as a sole carbon source, suggesting it utilized PET s degradation product, ethylene glycol, as a carbon source.(for detailed instructions on the preparation of the media see Protocols).Figure 28: E. coli expressing the codon-optimized(CO) LC-Cutinase grown on a M9 soft agar plate with shredded PET pellets as a sole carbon source.As seen from the images, the surface of the PET pellets is relatively smooth, there are some high crystallinity rod shaped structures but they are fairly covered.Figure 20: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days

from the image, both samples show growth, corresponding to P. putida s endogenic resistance and E. coli s plasmid acquired resistance to Chloramphenicol.Figure 42: Plate number 2 - samples grown on a

carbon sources for a period of 30 days.As seen in the images above, all LC-Cutinase variants were able to grow on the plates containing shredded PET, suggesting that the PET is degraded and E. coli is utilizing at least one of its products (we assume - ethylene glycol).The media containing plastic as the sole carbon source (PET, PE), reached higher O.D600 values from that of a medium with no carbon source (SM medium) but lower O.D600 than on glucose media or plastic enriched with AA media.Figure 32: E. coli expressing the R7 LC-Cutinase variant grown on a M9 soft agar plate with shredded PET

pellet in a X1000 magnification.Figure 6: A scanning electron microscope image of a PE pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X1000 magnification.For control, TPA presence was detected in plates containing E. coli transformed with an empty vector plasmid (the same vector used for expression of LC-Cutinase), and no bacteria at all.As proof of concept in the biofuel part of our project, Our test results may suggest that there is a potential in constructing a biofuel cell based on the electrochemical activity of P. putida KT 2440 with protocatechuic acid as an electron mediator.If our speculation was correct, the LC-Cutinase was supposed to be expressed from the E. coli, degrade the PET, and the bacterium could consume ethylene glycol from the degradation products.Here are the results of E. coli strain BL21 s growth with liquid M9 media containing ethylene glycol as a sole carbon source:Figure 27: E. coli strain BL21 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of EG for a period of 96 hours.That can be explained by the preferential degradation of the amorphous material exposing the better defined (higher crystallinity) material that goes through a slower degradation (Shah et al 2008).Figure 9: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.Figure 10: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.Figure 11: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.In order to assess the ability of our two chosen bacterial species - E. coli and P. putida to grow in symbiosis, a key element in our project s design, we cultivated both bacteria in a liquid LB medium, separated by a dialysis bag.Even though later tests with R. ruber show that the concentration of enzyme is an important part in efficiency of degradation,  we still decided to run these tests again, with equal enzyme concentrations on our 2 fastest variants - CO and F4:Figure 15: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of 3 LC-Cutinase variants - CO, F4 and the W.T., at a substrate concentration of 125?M.Looking at the entire design- our biofuel cell will consist of E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase that degrades the PET and consumes ethylene glycol (it includes the previous results in the E. coli ethylene glycol utilization results).In contrast, our results show no growth with TPA, which lead us to the conclusion that P. putida cannot utilize it as a sole carbon source.This experiment, although it cannot quantify the degradation efficiency, is another indication of the existence and activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme, and the ability of E. coli expressing our LC-Cutinase to utilize its degradation product- ethylene glycole.However, we have clearly shown that our bacteria can utilize PET as a carbon source using the LC-Cutinase protein, which is a proof-of-concept for one part of our project.Figure 44: PET plates (prepared as previously described in the PET Utilization experiment (Experiments Page), after colony growth, were exposed to UV light (as described in the Terephthalic acid detection assay (Experiments Page)), then tested in a fluorescence gel imager to detect TPA presence by excitation in 314nm end detecting emission at 426nm.We took samples from both PET and PE media (with pellets) and examined them with a Phase-contrast microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM):Figure 3: An image taken with a Phase-contrast microscope from SM media with PET after incubation with R. ruber.We can conclude from these results that our E. coli strain BL21, like other E. coli strains, can utilize EG as a sole carbon source, with an optimal concentration of 30mM.X1000 magnification.Figure 18: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days of incubation in a liquid LB broth with no bacteria.X1000 magnification.Figure 17: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days of incubation in a liquid LB broth with no bacteria.It should be mentioned that protocatechuic acid polymerizes in the presence of amine groups, a reaction that could interfere with the electron transfer, hence other more potent mediators will be explored including the operation of the biofuel cell without mediators, since P. putida are reported to produce their endogenous electron transfer mediators.We have demonstrated that creating a biofilm on a graphite anode can be easily done, making this part of our system applicable.As seen above, after incubation with the LC-Cutinase expressing bacteria, the surface of the PET is rougher than the control.X2500

Colony-PCR results used to the detect the presence of the aldA gene(1440bp) from E. coli shown on 1% agarose gel.Samples were left to incubate unopened for 3 months to test for the formation of biofilms.Figure 2: R. ruber biofilm formation on a PE pellet.In this experiment we grew E. coli strain BL-21 transformed with the pACYC vector containing the LC-Cutinase W.T.We have witnessed similar results with PET pellets, suggesting R. ruber can also utilize PET as a sole carbon source.As shown, plates containing E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase showed higher emission levels, which indicates of higher presence of TPA in the plates in question.Moreover, we see that E. coli remained viable throughout the experiment, verifying our hypothesis that it can grow inside a dialysis bag, and suggesting that our symbiotic design using a dialysis bag is plausible.We consider that result as an important step and a proof-of-concept of our final goal.gene grown in liquid M9 media with PET as a sole carbon source.Moreover, when comparing the bacteria expressing the LC-Cutinase gene and the bacteria transformed with an empty vector backbone, we see a clear difference in the texture of the PET.One method to assess the activity of our designed mutants was using the pNP-butyrate (pNP-B) degradation assay We ran the tests on all 5 variants of the LC-Cutinase protein with different concentrations of the substrate: Figure 12: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.It is important to note, that to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PET degradation by R. ruber is reported.We assume that this is the result of the PET degradation activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme.Those results are a consequence of a rupture in the dialysis membrane which occurred during the experiment.Reviewing these results leads us to the conclusion that the TPA degradation pathway must be cloned into the P. putida bacterium for efficient PET degradation.In order to test P. putida s ability to utilize TPA and PCA as a carbon source we measured O.D610 values for a period of ~100 hours with P. putida in liquid M9 media with either TPA or PCA as a carbon source.As seen from these results, all of our variants, including the codon-optimized Cutinase, have shown increased pNP-B degradation activity compared to the W.T.From these results we conclude that P. putida can utilize PCA as a sole carbon source, as previously reported.As seen from the results above, both bacteria maintained viability using our dialysis bag apparatus during the experiment.Samples taken from plates 1,3,6,7 and 10 were positive, suggesting they contained E. coli.Figure 41: Plate number 1 - samples taken from inside and outside the dialysis bag and grown over-night on a petri dish containing Chloramphenicol.As seen from the image, both samples show growth, suggesting that both samples contain P. putida, which has endogenic resistance to Ampicillin.It should be mentioned that it is not yet established that R. ruber is able to utilize PET as a carbon source.We have managed to show that out E. coli will be able to break down PET in conditions similar to those in our designed biofuel cell and to survive without any other carbon source.Controls are the same as with 50?M concentration.Figure 14: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.Contrary to our expectations, the untreated PET surface is smooth while the treated sample\u0092s surface seemed to have gone through degradation (fig.In the second day of measurements, there was a decline in power output probably due to cell death.As seen from the results, the Km values of our variants compared to the W.T.To prevent contamination, we used Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol (at 100?g/mL and 34.1?g/mL respectively) as selection markers.Figure 25: P. putida KT2440 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of PCA for a period of 96 hours.Please note, that when comparing the appearance of degraded PET between LC-Cutinase degraded PET and R. ruber degraded PET, they looked the  same, however, the difference was that it took a month to R. ruber to degrade PET to the observed picture (Fig.Moreover, our new LC-Cutinase genes consist of a PelB leader sequence that has been codon optimized to maximize expression levels in E. coli.5 and 10mM concentration were tested twice (\"a/b\").Figure 26: P. putida KT2440 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of TCA for a period of 136 hours.LC-Cutinase grown on a M9 agar plate no carbon source.Detection of TPA in plates containing PET and E. coli using fluorescenceAfter seeing bacterial growth on our PET plates, we wanted to combine our protocols of PET utilization and to detect the presence of TPA in our plates.Again, we can see that the CO and F4 variants have higher activity in regards to pNP-B degradation than the W.T.Figure 39: Colony-PCR results used to the detect the presence of the pcaD gene(792bp) from P. putida shown on 1% agarose gel.As part of our work with the P. putida KT2440 strain we wanted to test its antibiotic resistances, so we can select the appropriate cloning vectors.We cannot conclude which variant degrades the PET with the highest efficiency, as the PET in the plates is not evenly spread and the amount of PET degraded cannot be measured in this assay.Calculating the values from the CV measurements we found that the substance had a middle point Potential of E0 = 174 mV vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.Figure 43: Plate number 4 - samples taken from inside and outside the dialysis bag and grown over-night on a petri dish containing Kanamycin.For control we used E. coli strain BL-21 without any vector (\"BL-21\") with pACYC plasmid backbone only (\"pACYC\").Figure 13: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.That being said, more experiments are required in order to confirm our hypothesis and determine the proper concentrations of the protocatechuic acid and characterize the mechanisms with which it mediates P. putida s electron transfer.We also notice that the surface of the PET looks more porous and the rod shaped, high crystallinity PET, is more exposed than in the control.Which is an indication to the electroactivity of P. putida compared to control, with relatively high internal resistance.We can see a large increase in power output induced in the sample containing bacteria in the 250-500 mV range,  compared to the control.The internal resistance was measured in the first day with values of 60 ? for the cell containing bacteria and 1000 ? for the control.One control was PET pellets incubated for 2 days in LB liquid media with no bacteria.We speculated that in this case the EPS is used for the absorption of the PET micro particles and allows the accumulation of secreted enzymes.Moreover, when comparing the Kcat values of our variant to the W.T.Finally, we can see that the catalytic efficiency, portrayed by the Kcat/Km value, has been significantly improved in our variants, compared to the W.T.As seen from the image, no growth is visible in either sample.It can be explained by the ability of bacteria, i.e.", "safety": "\"Synthetic biology is a relatively new science with tremendous potential to change how we view and

regarding scientific research and progress.We thought that as we modify organisms in our lab enabling them to preform new functions,  we should learn our limitations and the complexities are involved in synthetic biology.(For example, at times, it was necessary to work with a chemical like Catechol, or to handle EthidiumSafe Project Design (Safety Risks to the General Public): Our final goal as

paper, \"Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View\u0094, Prof. Glick describes the Jewish approach towards scientific progress as well rounded and aware to the problems it presents: \"Judaism traditionally looks favorably on man as a co-creator with God and encourages research for the benefit of humankind.All of our project s lab members received safety training by our advisors, and had to partake in a lab safety online  course offered by the Ben Gurion University safety department.In order to ensure the safety of our product, we integrated into our design the self-destruct mechanism developed by the 2013 Ben Gurion University iGEM team.During the summer, we met several experts from the bioethics field, who gave us general new ethical insights that might be First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science.Thus, we learned that ethical issues need to be considered in many  Second, we learned that our designed product is encountered with a relativity new term called genetically modified organism  (GMO).In recent years, effective biosafety laws and regulations have been adapted by several countries to prevent terrorists and  other hostile powers from obtaining dangerous biological agents, technologies, or information that would allow them to  In 2008, the Israeli parliament (\"Kenesset\") decided to tighten biosecurity measures and legislated the regulation of  research into biological disease agents law, which provides a legislative framework to conduct research involved biological  disease agents.Furthermore, ethic  issues might arise during the research process.These principals are much alike some aspects  Familiarizing with the GMO concept, we discovered that there is a discrepancy between the way the public perceive bioethics and the way it is studied and practiced.But, in the Jewish tradition man is also charged with stewardship over nature and  is admonished to preserve and nurture, not just to exploit and destroy\".With this mechanism, not only the expression of our genes will be dependent on an IPTG inducer, but it will also force our E. coli to be fully dependent on an unnatural amino acid (UAA).In our project, we preformed multiple growth experiments using different intermediates in the PET degradation  pathway as carbon sources.Some of the chemicals have specific safety instructions according to their MSDS,  which were printed out and stored in the lab for all of the members to read and work according to.Synthetic biology promises significant advances in areas such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, agriculture, and medicine  Many concerns might stem from the field of synthetic biology.For instance, researchers confronts ethical questions regarding integrity, objectivity and authenticity during the research process.In the lab, we wear protective clothing and gloves at all times (unless working with fire).World-wide governments, including the federal regime in the USA, had a minor role in regulating and enforcing ethical  As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues.Many hold the view that  pollution is an insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care  for God s creation.Without supplying it to the bacteria medium, or in case of release to the environment (which will only happen by accident since we do not intend to release our bacteria), our E. coli bacteria will not survive.The Talmud which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, teaches  a basic ethical principle in Jewish law, the  Bal Tashchit  (\"do not destroy\") commend.Does a genetically modified organism can have a negatively effects on the environment or on human being?We found a quote from Rabi Moshe Ben Maimon (Maimonidas), a philosopher, scientist, polymath and one of the  most important adjudicators in the Jewish religion that lived in the Middle Ages :\"If men possessed wisdom, which stands  in the same relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye, they would not cause any injury to themselves or to others, for the knowledge of the truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual injuries\".The federal government in the USA and the European governments enforce all aspects regarding the research process, implementing rules and regulations.Third, we asked ourselves what is the potentially harmful consequences that may emerge when implementing new technology.We met with Prof. Shimon Glick from the  Faculty of Health Sciences (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be er-Sheva, Israel), an expert in the field of Jewish medical ethics.The law calls for the establishment of a council to regulate and monitor research on select infectious  disease agents.The federal government As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues.Our second bacterium, P. putida, which is design to consume TPA (one of the PET degradation products), would not be able to consume PET as it is dependent on LC-Cutinase (the enzyme which breaks the initial bond in the PET polymer into TPA and EG), since LC-Cutinase is expressed and secreted from E. coli.Such concerns  are also considered a biosafety matter as creating a GMO is accompanied with lots of uncertainties regarding its future effects on the environment.It also prescribes institutional committees with defined responsibilities and identifies means of control, Until the beginning of the 50 s there were no clear guide lines or standards for ethical behavior in conducting a research.Furthermore, GMOs is widely  We also learned that there are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, when a marked difference can be  found between the United states that favor for GMO products while Europe union is basically against.For example: Bacterium self - destruction switch mechanism that was developed by BGU iGEM Team 2013,  And allows to control the life time of the modified organism.Thus, the Jewish tradition would haves a positive attitude towards the current goals of synthetic biology.In the meeting Prof. Glick thought us about Jewish views of bioethics.In order to  enforce these regulations, government instructed the establishment of the Institutional Review Board (IRB).The lack of knowledge and the complexity of this field arise many  questions and concerns among the general public.(Prof. Bracha Rager-Zisman, Department of Microbiology  Immunology and Genetics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) .This way, the degradation process does not release any pollutants or toxins to the environment other than the  carbon dioxide and water bacteria produce in their own metabolic processes.The commend orders men not to waste or destroy our earth, the commend is invoked only for destruction that is deemed unnecessary.The Book of Genesis indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis emphasizes that

this is due to the difference in their degradation rates; while sok has a half life of 30 seconds, the half life of hok is much higher: of 30 minutes.Both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don\u0092t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.Additionally, both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don\u0092t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.In order for it not to be produced in higher concentrations than necessary, which can lead to the risk of it not being completely inhibited by sok, we have inserted only one hok sequence in this design.While the cells contain the DNA circuit and are inside the bioreactor, they will produce both the toxin and antitoxin, and will live.Therefore, the developed bacteria wouldn\u0092t be producing neither Lcp nor roxA, presenting no threats to usable rubber or to the environment.Although the simplified Hok-Sok kill switch mechanism proposed by our team allows, with low energy cost, the efficient and rapid death of the cells after leaving the bioreactor, it doesn\u0092t grant that cells inside the bioreactor which didn\u0092t inherit the developed DNA circuit die.As we use inducible promoters for producing the rubber degrading enzymes, if rhamnose isn\u0092t present on the environment, our genic circuit is off - presenting no threats.None of the used DNA parts in the main circuit has any direct relation with virulence and the organism presents low pathogenicity, besides being a commonly found bacteria.Besides the plasmid having an antibiotic resistance related part- on our first project design -, it is a known and common sequence, which can be easily obtained by DNA synthesis or acquiring the plasmid commercially, for example.If the bacteria is released from the bioreactor, it will be in an environment without rhamnose, and won t produce tetR - leading to the production of HokD, a protein that causes cell membrane depolarization, killing the microorganism.As the bacteria desired to survive will contain a plasmid with antibiotic resistance, it won\u0092t die - and all of the other bacteria will.This may be a problem to the process efficiency, as cells that aren\u0092t developing the desired processes will be competing for nutrients with the ones that contain the DNA circuit.A kill switch mechanism designed to be activated when the bacteria leaves the bioreactor was included in our DNA circuit.Brasil-USP team is very concerned about the project\u0092s biosafety, and considered it not only while working in the wet lab but also while designing our biological system.These acts as a physical containment for the developed bacteria and, therefore, minimize the risks of releasing it unexpectedly to the environment.Also, as these processes are being idealized to be performed in factories, only few people of the staff would have contact with the developed microorganism; and these would be specifically trained to minimize contamination - granting an even lower chance of the microorganism being released unexpectedly.The main molecule produced in this process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al), however there are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, it will be produced constantly while the cell is inside the bioreactor.The hok system promoter is changed to a constitutive one - so it will also be produced constantly.All the procedures applied in our team\u0092s project have been discussed with the members and no safety concerns were raised.Conditional suicide system for the containment of bacteria and plasmids.Our circuit uses inducible promoters (BBa_K91403; BBa_R0080; BBa_R0010), so if the trigger reactant isn\u0092t present our genic circuit is off, not producing the ODTD molecule, which might be toxic to the environment.This is how it works: the bacterial culture medium will contain rhamnose, activating the left part of our designed DNA circuit (Figure 1).In order to eliminate this issue, our team proposed inserting our circuit and the antibiotic resistance into the genome of the developed bacteria - avoiding horizontal gene transfer and the creation of potentially dangerous organisms.Therefore, no relevant risks to the environment were detected.On our first project design, however, we still depend on antibiotic resistance for maintenance of the desired plasmid.There are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, this strain is classificated in Risk group 1, and it meets the requirements of the US NIH.As the continuum use of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria and has been avoided by scientific community5, our team proposes a circuit that would be able to control these problems.The main molecule produced in this process is the 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD).Additionally, the E. coli BL21, contains several mutations silenced, and does not compete in the environment.It will not be constructed due to time issues, but it is idealized here (Figure 2).The circuits includes sok, a RNA antitoxin, under the rhamnose promoter; tetR is removed from the circuit.We are using a strain of E. coli that it s not supposed to survive greatly in the environment.In order to minimize the release of the developed bacteria to the environment, we were very careful in the disposal of biological material at the laboratory.For the proposed project, these contaminations will be controlled using antibiotics.All of the students involved in our project have received safety instructions for working at the laboratory.According to the DSMZ database, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are from the risk group 1, and does not offer any disease on healthy adult humans.For the Interlab study, we used E. Coli DH5-?.Unfortunately, physical containment alone isn\u0092t enough to ensure that the GMO\u0092s won\u0092t be released accidentally.If the kill switch fails, the bacteria will only survive in extreme conditions, which was a low probability to occur.O.

Coli without plasmid), confirmed by a Mann-Whitney U test.However, it is known that TatA is the most expressed gene of this pathway and it has 60% of homology with TatE, which can partially substitute TatA; TaTB can form a complex with TatC to prevent its degradation; there is evidence that TatC is the signal peptide binding protein and, finally, TatD produces no effect on protein translocation but has DNase activity.5 The secretion is composed by 12-16 different proteins, but none of these proteins have their specific roles elucidated.5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ompA mechanism is inserted in the type I secretion system which, in Gram negative bacteria, promotes the secretion of various proteins of different sizes and functions in one single step, without the necessity of a periplasmic intermediate.The proposed circuit provides the secretion of the proteins by the fusion with a specific signal sequence, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence, or its binding to the bacterial outer membrane by the fusion with a specific protein, OmpA fused with a linker (BBa_K1489002).We show in figures 2 and 3 our results.Figure 2 - Optical Density (OD) measurements over time, showing that all colonies were in their log phase.Figure 3 - Fluorescence per cell for each promoter, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.The first one aims to get the protein through the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and, for that, it can use three different pathways (the SecB-dependent pathway, the signal recognition particle (SRP), and the twin-arginine translocation (TAT)).Our results are in figure 4 and 5.Figure 4 - Fluorescence per cell for pLac, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.Unfortunately we weren\u0092t able to perform these tests, first due to our problems with promoter test and second because we are still in the circuit construction phase.We see that with IPTG, GFP activity incresases and RFP activity decreases, as it should happen.Figure 5 - Fluorescence per cell for each promoter, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.The second step is the protein translocation through the outer membrane, involving specific protein machinery known as the secreton.5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The TAT pathway, unlike the SecB or the SRP pathways, is capable of transporting folded proteins across the inner membrane independently of ATP using the transmembrane PMF (proton-motive force).5 This translocation system is composed mainly of five proteins (TatA, TatB, TatC, TatD and TatE) but their specific function have not been firmly established yet.Therefor we planned circuits with two exportation systems, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence and the fusion of the enzymes with the bacterial outer membrane, OmpA, to check which of these exportation systems were better for each of the enzymes.Not only the induced activity is lower than the activity without induction - for the first 3 concentrations of Rhamnose -, but also the RFP is also growing.BBa_K1819008 was submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts as a Brasil-USP team new part.Moreover, there are several large scale system established for E. coli use in industry and, since our project aim for industrial applications, we have chosen the E. coli system allied with the previously named secretion routes that might help increase enzymes  stability.Another possibility for our negative results is the wrong ligations between the parts, that again we just confirmed by agarose gel instead of sequencing.Figure 6 - Exportation test circuits (more information about the design of the circuits here).The protein being transported has a specific C-terminal signal sequence that usually has few to 50 glycine rich-repeats, that might be necessary for the protein function and, therefore, is not cleaved during the secretion6.These enzymes are fundamental for rubber degradation and have to be secreted or exposed in the exterior of the cell to be in direct contact with their substrate, the poly(cis-1,4 isoprene) - the main component of rubber.The exportation of RoxA ensures its passage through the bacterial periplasm which increases the chances of a correct folding of the protein.The designed circuits are shown in the figure below (Figure 6).The Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) system is classified as part of the type II bacterial secretion mechanism, which is composed of two steps.Figure 1 - Promoter test circuits (more information about the design of the circuits here).We intended to evaluate the exportations systems through GFP fluorescence, since this phenomenon depends on the correct folding of the protein, which in this case is linked with the folding of Lcp and RoxA.strain 35Y.1 However, most of these organisms show a slow growth when using rubber as a sole carbon source.2-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To improve microbial rubber degradation efficiency, our project aims to create a gene circuit which will, among other things, be responsible for coding and expressing two enzymes: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase A) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein).TAs mentioned earlier, our enzymes have to be secreted so they can be in contact with the substrate, moreover it\u0092s been seen that the heterologous expression of RoxA wasn\u0092t successful due to inclusion body formation.The secretion is driven by three proteins of the cell envelope6.The first one is located in the outer membrane, and is called OMP (Outer Membrane Protein); the other two are cytoplasmic membrane proteins, called ABC (ATP-Binding Cassette) and MFP (Membrane Fusion Protein).However, the choice of the promoter system is not as simple as the chassis .The Gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli is the most used chassis in Synthetic Biology.This signal sequence recognizes the ABC protein and triggers the assembly of the whole complex for the translocation process.Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed induction, i.e., induced fluorescence per cell was (statistically) significantly higher than our negative controls.Since we had no issues at all with any of our constitutive promoters (see for instance our Interlab Study, Pveg characterization in E. Coli, Linker-GFP part), our primary concern is that our protocols should be modified and optimized for induced promoters.Finally, no considerable changes were detected in the RFP measures.In the x-axis, the higher the concentration label, the higher the concentration, with zero means no induction at all.That being said, we designed circuits to test the viability of three different inducible promoters: Plac, Para and Prha (figure 1).", "safety": "If they leave the bioreactor, sok won\u0092t be produced, and the cell will die due to hok presence.For cells that didn\u0092t inherited the developed DNA circuit: these will contain Hok in their plasma, but not sok - this is due to the difference in their degradation rates;

BBa_R0080; BBa_R0010), so if the trigger reactant isn\u0092t present our genic circuit is off, not producing the ODTD molecule, which might be toxic to the environment.This is how it works: the bacterial culture medium will contain rhamnose, activating the left part of our designed DNA circuit (Figure 1).In order to eliminate this issue, our team proposed inserting our circuit and the antibiotic resistance into the genome of the developed bacteria - avoiding horizontal gene transfer and the creation of potentially dangerous organisms.Therefore, no relevant risks to the environment were detected.On our first project design, however, we still depend on antibiotic resistance for maintenance of the desired plasmid.There are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, this strain is classificated in Risk group 1, and it meets the requirements of the US NIH.As the continuum use of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria and has been avoided by scientific community5, our team proposes a circuit that would be able to control these problems.The main molecule produced in this process is the 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD).Additionally, the E. coli BL21, contains several mutations silenced, and does not compete in the environment.It will not be constructed due to time issues, but it is idealized here (Figure 2).The circuits includes sok, a RNA antitoxin, under the rhamnose promoter; tetR is removed from the circuit.We are using a strain of E. coli that it s not supposed to survive greatly in the environment.In order to minimize the release of the developed bacteria to the environment, we were very careful in the disposal of biological material at the laboratory.For the proposed project, these contaminations will be controlled using antibiotics.All of the students involved in our project have received safety instructions for working at the laboratory.According to the DSMZ database, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are from the risk group 1, and does not offer any disease on healthy adult humans.For the Interlab study, we used E. Coli DH5-?.Unfortunately, physical containment alone isn\u0092t enough to ensure that the GMO\u0092s won\u0092t be released accidentally.If the kill switch fails, the bacteria will only survive in extreme conditions, which was a low probability to occur.O. R. Faridani, A. Nikravesh, D. P. Pandey, L. Good, K. Gerdes Escherichia coli in the Environment: Implications for Water Quality and Human Health.All of the knowledge obtained in the course was applied on the project developed for iGEM.Graduated students have attended a course offered by S\u00e3o Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC/USP) about basic safety aspects, and then instructed undergraduate students about the precautions to be taken.The course included topics such as: the use of appropriated clothing and personal protective equipment; correct use of equipments such as autoclave, laminar hood flow, electrophoresis chamber and centrifuge; handling safety aspects and disposal of biological and chemical agents; specific danger of the main reagents used at the lab; and precautions about bioaerosol.The mechanism is expected to kill the cells almost immediately, with only a fraction of 1.4 x 10-4 the cells surviving after 90 minutes4.Therefore, the system is efficient for containing the microorganism spreading and its modified DNA transmission.", "keywords": "constructed UMBC15project1 crystalline trans-zeatin angiostatin interdisciplinary specificity angiogenesis scientists applications", "track": "Environment",

also students at the University!Here is a list over activities, seminars we ve held, articles about us, a radio interview and other things we have done to bring attention to our project.Presentation and stand.Our project has had several issues that we have had to consider, some of which were:- Patient confidentiality and availability of our product to the general public- Optimization of our assay to achieve a clinically relevant detection range- Proving that our set-up safely tests for ESBL-producing bacteria- Addressing antibiotic resistance potential on a genetic level in addition to phenotypic resistance All of the above problems have been points of thought and investigation to us.We can t fight this battle alone.Antibiotic resistance involves people all over the globe, and it is impossible to decrease the trend without as many as people being involved.We have been in touch with several experts in the field and we have held many lectures about our project to other students, from secondary school pupils to master students.Along with the birth of our idea, to create a product that would have access to peoples personal devices, and inform them as to whether resistant bacteria are present in them or not, came the realization that the eventual generation and storage of data would have to operate on a high level of security.It will be released after the trip.They made an article about us, which will be released soon.While we are attempting to fight antibiotic resistance with our novel diagnostic test, we acknowledge the fact that our test only works at a protein level.Therefore, we settled on expressing and testing for class A, and could easily also have done so for the other classes.Upon the realization that the Penta Well test deals only with the enzymatic activity of antibiotic resistance, we decided to attempt detecting also the genes causing said enzymatic activity.This was done by conferring with the experienced people working in our lab, walking them through our set-up and having them supervise us when we were handling the bacteria.Sequences provided by \u00d8rjan Samuelsen at the National Expertise Center of Antibiotic Resistance in Troms\u00f8.Although it includes relatively few sequences, this phylogeny suggests that the classes A, B C and D of ESBL are so different on a genetical level that the design we propose could probably be used to pin-point the class of ESBLs present in a sample, simply by designing crRNA/tracrRNA compatible to sequences unique to each class.This is something that in general has been of great importance to us; to utilize the potential and the potent expertise that resides in the institution that we are lucky enough to be a part of.However, he did not respond immediately, and this ended up being something that we kept in mind, and would have moved forward with if we were to continue with the project.Thus, by adding for example liquid compounds similar to X-gal, a visible color change could be achieved, similar to the one seen in our project with nitrocefin.By designing different tracr/crRNA sequences, this design could potentially be altered to recognize any gene present in high enough numbers in a liquid sample.This was not entirely successful, but we learned a lot from the experience, and we feel certain that we would have achieved clear results from this if we had time to do it again.Figure 1: Conceptual sketch of the proposed dCas9-systemTo investigate how this would work with different classes of ESBL, we aligned the sequences found in clinical isolates of ESBL infections in Norway (information provided by \u00d8rjan Samuelsen in Troms\u00f8).We have also gotten help from the headmaster to write about us in his blog, and we have also made it on different webpages.This was achieved; we successfully purified a class A ?-lactamase using a biobrick from the Calgary team of 2013 (see the \u0093biobrick\u0094 section).For each target gene, we propose to have two sets of tracr/crRNA, complementary to different, but adjacent parts of the same gene.In addition to spreading the word about iGEM, we presented our project and told the new students of the problem of antibiotic resistance.If we were to further advance our project, the imminent steps to be taken would be to realize our CRISPR/Cas9 system, optimize the set-up with clinically isolated ESBL-samples and purifying class B and C ESBL-proteins.Ragnhild, Paul, Marthe and Torleif held those seminars, and they did a really good job.Torleif also handed out our comic book to Dokka VGS, the high school in the municipality of Nordre Land.These amazing pictures is made by Antje Hofgaard who works as an senior engineer at the department.We have done a lot to get public attention about iGEM, but also about us and antibiotic resistance.In the end, by using a high concentration of nitrocefin and lysing the bacteria, we achieved a detection limit of clinical significance.It was held at Kristine Bonnevies house at the University and there were also pizza afterwards.The UiOslo team have used the iGEm season to teach synthetic biology to kids and high school students.We also moved on to prove that even very low concentrations of the protein produced a reliable signal with nitrocefin, that it was inhibited by clavulenic acid (CVA, the inhibitor for class A enzymes in the Penta Well test), and integrated this into our hardware and software.Further, earlier detection would lower the probability of spreading of the resistant bacteria, potentially protecting a lot of people from painful, dangerous infections.We have appeared several newspapers, attended a science festival, got interviewed for a TV-show, been in magazines and even on the radio.We have used social media, we have a blog, radio, magazines, different newspapers and even published a comic book to hand out.By fusing these two peptides to two separate dCas9 constructs recognizing adjacent parts of the same gene, the presence of said gene would be coupled to the forming of a functioning galactosidase.We share fun stuff as well as relevant articles and keeping people updated about our project.BlogWe also have a blog which we try to update regularly.To investigate this, we brainstormed around the issue, and reached out to Gissle Hannemyr, an expert in software security at the University of Oslo.This outline is a result of conferring with supervisors Dirk Linke, Eric de Muinck and Paul Grini along with correspondence with Kevin M Esvelt from the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA (corresponding author of the article \u0093Cas9 as a versatile tool for engineering biology\u0094, PubMed ID: 24076990).Let s hope they ll get more excited about synthetic biology.Increasing knowledge for new students at the universityThe 30th of August and the 6th of September we held lectures for new biology students at the University.We did in the end attempt a run of our set-up with clinical isolates.You can see some pictures of it on the right side, or you can visit our stand and get one yourself.However the 3D-model is available online, and we have given the file to the \u0093Biologylab\u0094 at Department of Biosciences.Hopefully, they can use another printer and use it for educational purposes.This was important to us; as a proof of concept, we formed our set-up using \u0093regular\u0094 AmpR bacteria.Most important of all; it has been so much fun!Increasing knowledge for primary and secondary school pupilsThe 27th and the 28th of September \"Ungforsk\" was arranged at the University.This was achieved largely through corresponding with \u00d8rjan Samuelsen at the Norwegian Center of Competence on Antibiotic Resistance in Troms\u00f8.We have learned so much while doing this and we have met so many interesting people on the way.We also want to stress the issue that we created the chassis, in form of biobricks, to also express class B and C ESBLs, but did not do this due to bio-safety concerns.proteinIn addition to this, we contributed to generate electron microscopy pictures of our clinical isolates.These pictures will be used to educate high school students and contribute to increase knowledge  about biology among high school students.First of all, we had to get our hands on both the bacteria themselves and information about them.As the central dogma of molecular biology dictates, protein is the last instance in the information flow in a cell.When the tracr/crRNA finds its goal, dCas9 would bring the two parts of the split-enzyme together, thus creating a detectable signal.Because of this we have generated a 3D file for a bacteria.The numbers that returned (averaging around 10^5/10^6 bacteria/mL) did not correlate with the detection limits we saw in our initial experiments with nitrocefin.The first thing we did in respect to clinically relevant detection limits, was to contact experts to find out the bacterial number one can expect in urinary tract infections.For more information about the strains that were used, the set-up and the results, see under the \u0093Lab\u0094-section.Second, ESBL-producing bacteria classify as bio-safety level 2, meaning that we had to thoroughly think through and plan whatever we wanted to do with them.You can listen to it here.MagazinesWe have been in the University magazine Apollon.We consider Human practices to be one of the most important and rewarding things about iGEM.But, eventually, we wanted to move on to the big bads; clinical isolates of ESBL-producing bacteria.Our goal was to spread the knowledge not only about synthetic biology, but especially about our project antibiotic resistance in general.We share things about our project, but also conferences we ve attendend, as well as other fun stuff to keep people interested.The idea behind this was to generate a bacteria that could be taken apartso one could have a look inside the bacteria, of what it contains and how it is build up.For the investigation part of said issues, see below.This led to the CRISPR/Cas9 design described further under \u0093Gold\u0094.\"Ungforsk\" roughly translated means young science and was arranged for the 20th time.All of these things points to a need for a diagnostic tool that not only detects enzymatic activity, but also the genes leading to said enzymatic activity.The problem of resistance genes could of course also reside on a genetic level, upstream of actual enzymes.Expressing those proteins would mean creating dangerous, resistant bacteria in our lab, which we did not want to do unnecessarily.Naturally, this was not something we desired to do - we do not want our test to rely on distribution of resistant bacteria.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "For this reason, all work that includes biological factors class 2 should occur only in a biosafety 2 level lab with an updated risk assessment, so that the researcher at all times can take steps to reduce the exposure to a minimum.In addition to this the UiO iGEM team has been through a customized HSE review specialized to the lab where our workspace is located.Thus, we obtained ?-lactamases from three different classes (A, B and C) without working directly with the isolates.After proving that our test worked and optimizing it using relatively harmless bacteria (for more information about this, see the \"Lab\" section), we had the test tried out on some of the clinical isolates.Read morea about the specified procedures and regulations for working with biological factors class 2 from our university.These regulations are in Norwegian, and contain procedures on how to work with biological factors in a secure and healthy manner.In this way we have ensured that safety measures have been maintained at all times, and we have never felt uncomfortable in the lab.Before starting up with the laboratory work our team had a dialogue with the safety committee from iGEM HQ about the use of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria harbouring said genes.A list of some of the precautions the team have taken for regular procedures in the lab is listed here: * When working with bacteria gloves and lab coat are used at all times.First of all we never work in the lab alone; there have been a minimum of two or more students from the team at all times.Working in the lab, especially in a BSL 2 lab, came with specialized guidelines and regulations.To minimize the risk that may arise from working in such a lab, it is important to always be aware of the risk factors every experiment pose, in addition to those that may arise if something goes wrong.In this way, we felt confident that the work was done in a secure manner within a safe environment.In the cases where an appropriate SOP did not exist in this library, a safety representative from the team wrote an appropriate SOP and had it approved by the HSE manager.The UiOslo iGEM team and our project have been governed by the general regulations and safety procedure of the University of Oslo, regulations that apply to the institution as a whole.We recognized the potential risks of working with antibiotic resistance genes, and wanted to get feedback from the safety committees on this.All of the work was of course done in a high security biosafety cabinet using gloves and lab coat at all times.This is to ensure a good work environment and the safety of the employees and other members of the institution.As a researcher you have a responsibility that your research is performed according to the standards of good research practice and established scientific and ethical principles.UiO has a strong focus on research ethics and safety.As some of the team members are not molecular biologists and have limited lab experience they have been encouraged to join lthe ab work with one of our molecular biologists, who are used to functioning in the landscape of the lab.UiO has a library of common procedures that is performed at the Department of Biosciences; here we obtain the appropriate SOP.In addition to this, a responsible from our supervisors research group have been available and nearby at all times.Also, of course, over the course of the last months, we have developed some routines to ensure that the safety guidelines are followed at all times.A SOP (procedures, risk assessment and waste disposal) informs of the risks that comes with the experiment in question and how to minimize these, what the researcher should be aware of when performing the experiment and how to appropriately dispose of reagents and waste.This kind of training ensures that all students, as well as other members of the working environment, have the necessary training to perform for their duties and fulfill their responsibilities put forward by their work.When working with these isolates we used disposable tubes that went directly in a risk waste bin designated for work of this nature.Doing so minimize the amount of work to be done with the actual clinical isolates.When the work in biosafety cabinet was done, UV-light was employed to kill any bacteria inside.This is to prevent transfer of potential infectious material the spread of this into the environment.Together with our supervisors, we decided to synthesize (by IDT) some of the genes obtained from Troms\u00f8 and have them transformed into regular laboratory E. coli.As already mentioned, it is a BSL2 lab, meaning that all of these things are of utter importance.All students at the UiO receives HSE training specialized to the faculty they belong to.Before any experiment, the appropriate SOP must be carefully read through.Our work with organisms within risk group 2 was reduced to a minimum.When working with bacteria it is important to wear gloves and an appropriate labcoat at all times to minimize the chance of contamination.We have also used the check-ins forms provided by iGEM HQ as a precaution even though antibiotic resistance genes do not require a check in.This center has a high level of expertise when it comes to antibiotic resistance bacteria, and their knowledge has been of a huge benefit to us.", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track": "Diagnostics", "part_favorite": "",

we have submitted a basic part for the improved elongated GS linker.In the experiment, we hypothesized that an elongated linker would enhance the function of the fusion protein for the original linker is too short for the proper folding of the two domains.However, we found no result in the previous history using this linker.So we went to the linker library in iGEM part registry website to search for a longer linker.Through the reference searching, we found that the previous research all used the three-alanine linker.(see Design & Device)This year, we have designed fusion proteins of spider toxin in conjunction with snowdrop lectin by the three-alanine linker.In the experiment(See the Link), the fusion protein with the elongated GS linker did show the enhanced repellent effect.Therefore, we modified the sequence and added three more amino acids into the linker in case it was still too short for proper protein folding.Observed from the phenomenon, we did prove the enhanced function of the fusion proteins, so we speculate that the fusion protein has a better secondary structure than the original ones.It is a revolutionary system that not only guarantees the safety of the farmers and customers worldwide but also safeguards the sustainability of the environment and ecosystem.", "design": "2001, 276, 40306\u009640312Elaine Fitches, Martin G.

[5]In nature, spiders inject venom into the haemolymph of insects\u0092 that causes the death of the prey.AnachnoServer is an online database that contains nearly 800 peptide toxin information from 78 spider species[1], and UniProt is a library of protein information.Also, snowdrop lectin is proved to be resistant to proteolytic activity in the insect gut.Another apprehension about nowadays insecticidal pesticide is that through bioaccumulation, the pesticide chemical residue will accumulate in the human body, and can\u0092t be degraded by us.The traditional pesticide will kill all the insects in the farmland no matter it is pest or not.The inspiration for Pantide originates from the food chain.The active site in the peptide that performs its toxicity are the amino acids located in loop regions.[6] Snowdrop Lectin recognizes the glycoproteins on the epithelial cell in the insect gut and facilitates the fusion protein to cross the epithelial cell by transcytosis.To tackle this problem, Pantide is species specific to several orders of pests, Hv1a targets Lepidopteran, Orthopteran, and Dipteran, Sf1a targets Lepidopteran, and Dipteran, OAIP targets Lepidopteran and Coleopteran.The devices in each area will collect the farmland conditions respectively, and the data will be transmitted to one host device in each area through Bluetooth, and then the host will upload the data of its area up to the cloud through WiFi.By using these three peptides alternately, the pest is hard to have resistance.For the practical application in the farmland, the farm will be divided into several areas, in each area, several sets of devices and sensors will be installed.Take Hv1a as an example for proving the stability of ICK; Hv1a is highly stable in the temperature range of -20\u00b0C to 75\u00b0C and pH values of 1 to 8.Sf1a is a toxic peptide derived from Segestria florentina (Tube-web spider).In this case, we chose snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) lectin as a carrier of toxin peptides to create a fusion protein.Spiders are one of the most successful terrestrial venomous creatures on earth.Hv1a is lethal to several insect orders but is not toxic to mice.; Christie, M.J.; King, G.F. \u0093Discovery and structure of a potent and highly specific blocker of insect calcium channels,\u0094 J.

protein works performs its toxicity better.In the two-hour test, we can see that most of the tobacco cutworms move to eat the negative control group, which proves the repellent effect of Pantide.After the three experiments, we have three conclusions.Pantide performs its toxicity as a repellent in vivo.The remained leaves area decreased as the concentration of PANTIDE decreased, which shows the dose response of Pantide.In comparison with the two other design, we could find out that the remained leaves area with improved Hv1a-lectin were all more than that of the original Hv1a-lectin and Hv1a.(a)

in an easy way, the testee selection, and experiment design would be briefly described.(Table 1)After amplification with PCR, the PCE products of Hv1a, Sf1a, and OAIP have a length of around 500bp? and Hv1a-Lectin, Sf1a-Lectin, and OAIP-Lectin has a length of 750bp~1000bp? and Hv1a-Lectin with GS linker has a length of 893bp.It shows in figure5.To use the p-value as an indicator of statistical significance, we compared Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin with the negative control; it shows that the remained leaf disk area of Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin are significantly different from negative control, shown in figure6.To sum up, the Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin work well in vivo.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification analysis of electrophoresis of seven PCR products with Marker labeled length on the left hand (a)Hv1a (BBa_K1974011, 495 base pairs).(Table 3)The gel of SDS-PAGE result of Hv1a, Sf1a, OAIP have a length of 5kDa~7 kDa?and Hv1a-Lectin, Sf1a-Lectin, OAIP-Lectin, and Hv1a-GS linker-Lectin have a length of 17kDa~19kDa.The T-test analysis in different dose of GS-linker improvement test.To know how the length of the linker affect the function of the fusion protein, we constructed Hv1a-lectin with the original three-alanine linker and a longer GS linker.The T-test analysis in different dose of OAIP/OAIP-lectin.In this experiment, we compared the toxicity effect of the three toxin designs including Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin/Hv1a-lectin with GS linker to test the toxicity effect.To know the qualitative toxicity effect of Pantide, we prepared the samples with the sonicated LB solution lysate containing Pantide-expressed E. coli Rosetta-Gami strain and diluted it with the three concentration.SDS-PAGE result of the seven purified Pantide products compared with the unpurified one, and with Marker labeled length on the left hand.In the following experiments, we used E. coli BL21 Rosetta-Gami strain to produce Pantide.The T-test analysis in different dose of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin.Figure4 shows the pictures of the remained leaf disks after twelve hours of feeding assays.The tobacco cutworms have a preference on the leave disks without applying Pantide.Although Pantide does not act as a biological pesticide as our hypothesis had mentioned, we may conclude that it is a biological insect repellent, which corresponds to our ideology of lowering the artificial impacts on the environment and simultaneously achieve effective pest control.Remained leaves in the GS-linker improvement test with the Hv1a, Hv1a-lectin, and Hv1a-lectin GS-linker improved.Figure14.All the experiments were to check the functions of Pantide for leaf protection, so the observation of the results would focus on the remained area of the leaf disks.The dose response is shown in figure5.Compared Hv1a with Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area in the Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a, which means the repellent efficiency of Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a.Figure11 shows the ratio of the remained area on the leaf disks.Figure5 shows the percentage of the remained area on the leaf disks.After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratios, we measured the area with the software imageJ.After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratio, we measured the area with the software

further purified Pantide to check whether it is well-expressed.The effect can be roughly ranked as:Hv1a-lectin > Hv1a > E. coli > Negative controlWe got the similar result in the Sf1a/Sf1a-lectin and OAIP/OAIP-lectin.Figure7.The p-value of the T-test can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other.In the test of Pantide toxicity, we chose tobacco cutworm as the testee for the insect appetite tests because all the Pantide targets lepidopterans.Remained leaf disks in the pre-test with the OAIP and OAIP-lectin.Figure11.Remained leaf disks in the pre-test with the Sf1a and Sf1a-lectin.Figure8.The observed phenomenon can be analyzed below.With the dilution of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area decreased, which indicates the dose response.SDS-PAGE result of the six Pantide-expressed sonicated products compared with the unexpressed sonicated one as a control and with Marker labeled length on the left hand.Afterward, we sonicated E. coli and then ran SDS-PAGE to make sure that Pantide fell into the correct ranges.The positive control in the experiment was to apply Bacillus thuringiensis on the leaf disks, which is nowadays the most widely-used bioinsecticide, and the negative control group in the test was DD water.This experiment is the pre-test that shows us whether the amount of Pantide is sufficient enough to perform the toxicity against the larvae.(Table 2)The gel of SDS-PAGE result is correct, and here is our result.Besides, there is also a Hv1a without the linker between the repellent peptide and the lectin served as a comparative sample.In the picture, it shows as a star.We hope that we can observe the difference of the three toxins in vivo.We applied the sample onto the leaf disks and put five cutworms into the separate cabinets for feeding assays.We preserved all the result of the remained leaves sealing with the glass paper and calculated the percentage of the remained area on the leaves.The results consist of three parts-feeding assay pre-test, the fusion protein improvement test, and preference test.The mechanism of the repellent effect is so far unknown.The toxicity efficacy of Pantide is equal to Bacillus thuringiensis.According to the mechanism of Pantide, Pantide is supposed to perform its toxicity in the nervous system of the larvae.(Figure 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g) As a result, the constructions of BioBrick were correct.Figure 3.With the elongation of the linker, the improved fusion protein has the best repellent effect.**Note: The word \u0093Pantide\u0094 in the following paragraph refers to the collection of all the toxin design in our project.Figure6 shows the p-value with the star attached to indicate P < 0.05 and two stars to indicate P < 0.01.B is the elution product of purification.", "safety": "To ensure that Pantide will degrade into amino acids when it is released into the environment, we have done an experiment to prove that Pantide does degrade in the ultraviolet light.Therefore, we should guarantee that Pantide is safe to humans and harmless to the environment.So, after we expressed Pantide with E. coli, the LB broth containing E.coli should be first sonicated by the sonicator to let Pantide be soluble in the LB broth.(See the experiment) Once we have known that Pantide will degrade in the ultraviolet light, we may conclude that Pantide will degrade in the natural light over time.One is the laboratory safety; the other is the safety of spraying Pantide into the environment.Before entering the laboratory, all the members in NCTU_Formosa must receive several training courses and evaluate exams offered by Environmental Protection and Safety Center.So it is harmless for the environment.With the degradation modeling simulation (See the Modelling), we may also apply the degradation rate into the automatic spraying device.For humans, Pantide will not have any negative effect on human health.As a result, we design a processing standard in the laboratory.When the customer gets the agricultural produce from the market, most of the Pantide is thought to have degraded into amino acids and even there is some residue of Pantide on the surface of the product.When it is washed into the soil or in water resources, Pantide is ineffective to the microbiomes and the vertebrate in the ecosystem.The content of the training courses consists of four parts.For the basic laboratory safety instruction, we learned the safety level of laboratories and personal protective equipment.For the laboratory emergency response, we learned of how to react to several emergency situations and certain procedure dealing with specific chemicals.For the toxic chemical operation and management, we learned the content of the material safety data sheet (MSDS).For biosafety, we learned biological hazard, including levels of biohazard and instructions of dealing with biological trash.The four training courses contain an evaluating exam.Instead, it can be as the fertilizer.The product we spray into the environment should not contain any genetically-modified organisms.SDS-PAGE gel and the concentrations of boiling test to native Hv1a-lectin (17.1 kDa).After taking the courses and passing the exam, we all get certificates for each training.In the future, we plan to spray Pantide onto the environment.", "keywords":

"Thus, the mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase that we design will be able to enzymatically distinguish the wild-type leucine from the protected leucine.Through research and experimentation, we determined

leucine to be incorporated normally into polypeptides.To accomplish this goal, we aimed to select a protecting group for leucine and a corresponding cleavage enzyme to remove the protecting group, and

incorporating normal leucine amino acids into proteins, while still being reliant on protected leucine.Our protecting group needs to bind to the N-terminus of leucine, as the C-terminus of the amino acid has to bind to tRNA.The amino-acyl-tRNA bond formation active site should be sterically altered to select for CBZ-leucine, and the editing site should also be changed so that it recognizes wild-type-leucyl-tRNA as an incorrect pairing.To implement this system completely, the genes for both the CBZ cleavage enzyme and for the mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase need to be readily transcribed and translated into functional proteins in the organism.Additionally, to ensure that leucine is not usable in the organism s metabolism, the wild-type leucyl-tRNA synthetase gene needs to be knocked

"human_practice": "Working with the head of the Open Bio Labs, we created a biosafety guidelines document, including provisions on biocontainment.Not only did we work to improve awareness of and dialogue about biocontainment in the general public, but we also considered the iGEM community as another target audience.In response to these discussions, our team generated a sample policy proposal for the testing, application, monitoring, and termination of biocontainment devices in a released GEO.In the development of our method, we conducted interviews not only with synthetic biology experts, but also with individuals working in various industries that use microbes or genetically engineered organisms (GEOs).Feedback on our proposed biocontainment method from synthetic biology experts allowed us to reassess our project design, our definition of success, and how we would demonstrate that success.The results of this survey and our conversations with scientific and ethical experts informed the creation of a biocontainment pamphlet for the use of future iGEM teams.Despite the rapid growth of the field, several applications face barriers to implementation, including the lack of an effective, cheap, and easy-to-use biocontainment method.In addition to educating other teams about biocontainment, these conversations allowed us to gauge the current knowledge and concerns of the iGEM community.With industry experts, we discussed the potential for application of our biocontainment method in their companies or industries.As the field of synthetic biology moves out of its infancy, molecular biologists, community biology laboratories, and iGEM teams around the globe are making revolutionary discoveries with more frequency and greater impact.In July, our team facilitated a forum discussion about biocontainment at the University of Maryland\u0092s Mini-Jamboree event.At this event, we designed our own module and accompanying video to teach children and their parents about the purpose of biocontainment.We also created a widget that teams can utilize to determine the best biocontainment method for their project, depending on their specific concerns and implementation goals.To further improve public awareness on synthetic biology and biocontainment, we created two videos on these topics.Oftentimes, individuals working in relevant industries were very knowledgeable about the biological concerns raised by our methods and offered insight on the design or testing of our method.Additionally, we spoke to the main regulatory agencies of GEOs in the US about their current policies.However, while speaking to these experts, it was clear that lack of an acceptable biocontainment method was not the only barrier preventing implementation.", "modeling": "The following is a visualization of our mutant synthetase with optimal structure.Upon initiation, MUT asks for four main inputs: the protein pdb file that will be analysed, the residues that the program will mutate, the coordinates of the binding pocket for docking simulations, and a ligand pdb file.To perform mutagenesis on leucyl-tRNA synthetase, an integrated software script was written in the Linux shell, with inputs including a protein to mutate, a ligand, a list of residues of interest, and binding pocket location.Using a variety of protein-ligand docking software like CSM-lig, Autodock Vina and iGEMDOCK, we were able to confirm that AMS (the adenylating agent found in the literature) and AMP yield similar binding affinities to the synthetase when bound with leucine.Lastly, we performed Michaelis-Menten modeling for the enzyme pepsin to gauge activity in nonspecific cleavage enzymes.The leucine tRNA Synthetase (LeuS) used in the following simulations was found using the RCSB Protein Data Bank.After mutagenesis is complete files undergo stability testing and docking to determine if the new mutant is stable and a better match for the ligand.To select a protecting group, the team used protein-ligand docking software to compare binding affinities of several protected leucine/synthetase complexes.Should the results look bad, mutants from a lower ranking can be selected or new residues can be picked.Virginia iGEM designed a Linux-based protein engineering tool called MUT.MUT first performs stability testing and docking to get baseline values for the future tests before it mutates the initial PDB file.However, the binding affinities for all the protecting group choices were very similar, so we chose based on a different set of criteria.Another 4 data runs were performed and can be found in the supplementary data section, but exhibit similar results.Several programs were used to asses the viability of the different protecting groups in our system.Biochemistry 46, 4466\u00964472.To find residues of interest in the catalytic pocket, we used a combination of docking data as simulated in iGEMDOCK and of structural data visualized in Ligplot to determine additional mutational focci.The following is a PyMol visualization of the protein that we compiled.As stated in its documentation, during the characterization of 4aq7, a leucyl-adenylate analogue was used to determine the crystal structure of the protein.Energistic relationships between molecules of 4aq7 are shown in detail in the 2D representation, and conformational analysis can be conducted on the 3D image.The following residues were picked for mutagenesis.Residues that returned large values in the protected leucine simulations were believed to have a high impact on the reduced viability of docking.Once an initial ranking has be completed, the user has the option to rerun docking on the selected mutants to confirm the simulation.The user inputs to MUT a protein\u0092s PDB file, residues of interest for mutation, a binding pocket, and a ligand.The editing site mutation, Thr 252, allows for the hydrolysis of Leu-tRNA, a crucial step in our overall project.22Reference:Mursinna, R.S., Lee, K.W., Briggs, J.M., and Martinis, S.A. (2004).This program was used to query for the optimal mutant structure for Cbz-Leu docking.Residues that protruded around the N terminus of leucine, the location the protecting group binds to, were thought to be possible sources of steric hindrance.Three programs are used to accomplish this task: PyRosetta conducts computational mutagenesis, FoldX tests protein stability, and AutoDock Vina performs protein-ligand docking.Of the four mutations, one is in the editing site while the other three are in miscellaneous locations around the protein.After the simulation runs, the program outputs a top ten list of mutant structures along with their files.In order to determine the relative efficiency of our enzyme, we modeled another BioBrick.These are detailed in the following figure.Pugh chart used to score and rank possible protecting groups.First, the residue had to have been shown to have a high energy during docking.Some of the criteria are practical like the cost of the protecting group and enzyme.After the reductionist approach is complete, all files are mutated to four mutants and re-scored.We modeled our system in silico to select a sterically feasible protecting group and to optimize a mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase for complementarity of its catalytic site to protected leucine, and of its editing site to leucine.MUT utilizes PyRosetta, Autodock Vina, and FoldX to mutate, test, and rank protein structures based on docking scores.MUT generates mutant structures, subjects the resultant proteins to stability testing, and ranks the results based on protein-ligand docking data.Ligplot is capable of creating a 2D image of the binding site as detailed in the crystolography file.Files that fail the tests go to the kennels.BBa_M1436 codes for pepsinogen, an inactive form of the cleavage enzyme pepsin.This program is used to screen protein-ligand docking across possible protein mutants.The first and fastest way is the reductionist approach.Below is a flowchart that explains the algorithm of the program.The kennel system allows for two levels of simulation.The script runs mutagenesis, assesses mutant protein stability, then performs ligand docking.This method ensures that all possible combinations of mutations is tested, but is computationally intense.After a run is complete, all files are automatically ranked and ordered by binding values (more negative is better).Thus, 4aq7 represents an protein that can accurately model our system containing leucyl-AMP and LeuS.The above figure shows select data from CSM-lig comparing Cbz-leu-AMS (Left) and Cbz-leu-AMP (Right).By analyzing the file contents in PDBest, a PDB editor software, we identified the analogue as leucyl-AMS.We constructed six different molecules with ChemSketch in order to determine whether the analogue significantly altered the conformation of LeuS.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "", "keywords": "resistance

second approach would have the advantage that it takes into account the efficiency of the genetic devices, because our experiments have shown that aspects such as operator placement and translation efficiency have a great impact on the functionality of the biosensor and are difficult to predict.For the future, we envision that a model with optimized parameters could be used to predict a range of repressor concentrations for an optimal output signal and the desired sensitivity.Therefore, we investigated several crucial design aspects with our model.Simulated sfGFP production when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 8 nM repressor plasmid are used (blue lines) or when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 300 nM repressor dimer are present (green lines).A CFPS biosensor is an open system, which means that the components can be manipulated more easily than in a whole-cell biosensor.There are two fundamentally different operating modes with regard to the repressor: It can either be encoded on a plasmid and be co-expressed with the reporter, or the protein is already present in the reaction mixture.When the reporter:repressor ratio is too high, there is a strong background signal and the relative increase in the presence of an analyte is small and would be difficult to discern (orange lines in the figure).The same analyses could be performed in order to optimize a reaction with a purified repressor.Importance of the reporter:repressor plasmid ratio.As can be seen from the figure, there is a weak background signal when a repressor plasmid is used, because it takes some time until enough repressor has been expressed to suppress the expression of the reporter.According to the model, the fluorescence in the presence of the repressor plasmid should be significantly lower than in the presence of a \"neutral\" plasmid, which competes for resources but does not encode a repressor.In contrast, when the repressor protein is already present in a sufficient amount, there is no background signal and the signal in the induced state is twice as high.In view of these results, a pre-existing repressor protein is the better option for a CFPS biosensor.In contrast, when the ratio is too low, an induction is not possible because of the strong repression and because most resources are used for the expression of the repressor (blue).Moreover, the signal in the presence of an analyte is weaker due to the competition of reporter and repressor mRNA for resources.We then compared the results to a simulation in which the same amount of repressor dimer was present from the beginning.Otherwise, further tests and adjustments to the model parameters are necessary in advance.Using this procedure, it is also possible to generate test strips that include several spots that detect the same analyte, but give a signal at different analyte concentrations.This would allow for the amount of repressor to be precisely controlled.The results showed us that the ratio of the plasmid concentrations is very important for a functioning biosensor.Our model accurately describes the expression of sfGFP in our cell-free protein synthesis and is able to predict the effects of the competition of two plasmids for resources.We chose this operating mode for the characterization of our biosensors and used a cell extract that had been prepared from cells expressing the necessary repressor or activator.One crucial component is the repressor, because its amount is decisive for the sensitivity and background signal of the biosensor.Furthermore, when the intensity of the fluorescence is to be used for quantification, it is possible to obtain a larger linear range using several spots with different detection limits.Currently our model uses parameters for repression and induction which were determined for the lac operon.To analyze the differences, we modelled a CFPS reaction with equimolar amounts of reporter and repressor gene in the non-induced and fully induced state.Given the parameters of our model, a ratio of 1:1 yields the best compromise between low background and strong induced signal (green).We tested this prediction with a plasmid that encodes the arsenic repressor and a second plasmid that contains the arsenic operator in front of sfGFP (BBa_K1758300).For future applications it would therefore be desirable to determine the specific parameters of the repressor proteins we worked with.This is a convenient method, however, it would be an even better option to add a purified protein to the reaction.8 nM of each plasmid were used.The position of the arsenic operator relative to the T7 promoter in the PT7-arsO-UTR-sfGFP plasmid is not ideal, as the distance needs to be very small to efficiently block the T7 RNA polymerase (Karig et al.Plasmids encoding sfGFP, either with the arsenic operator (arsO) or without, were combined with plasmids encoding the arsenic repressor (arsR) or mRFP1.A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that in the absence of an analyte, the translation rate constants are most important for the output signal.Therefore, the model could significantly reduce the number of necessary experiments.Therefore, we looked more closely at the importance of the plasmid ratio.This is sufficient for making qualitative predictions about the behaviour of our biosensors, but it does not enable us to predict exact concentrations for the different biosensors we used.These concentrations could then be tested in the lab.Therefore, the amount of active ArsR was likely lower than predicted by the model.These results show that the model predictions are only valid for optimized genetic constructs and CFPS conditions.", "notebook": "Find out how we developed and optimized our own cell extract.See

PRIA s biosafety status we interviewed Dr. Mathias Keller from the district government in Detmold (\"Bezirksregierung Detmold\").He lists examples for the environment where a close contact between DNA and cells are likely to occur, like sewage treatment plants, our digestive tract and the soil.In conclusion, our expert assured us that cell-free systems are safer and better to use for the user than cell-based systems.We asked how the district government deals with the release of DNA from genetically-modified organisms into the environment.For the use of these systems one does not need to be a user of a genetic engineering facility.DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2013.00005 Nielsen, Kaare M.; Johnsen, P\u00e5l J.; Bensasson, Douda; Daffonchio, Daniele (2007): Release and persistence of extracellular DNA in the environment.We want to do a risk assessment to determine to which extent DNA is released in the environment when using PRIA.This is true no matter how the DNA is produced.Guan, Zheng-jun; Schmidt, Markus; Pei, Lei; Wei, Wei; Ma, Ke-ping (2013): Biosafety Considerations of Synthetic Biology in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition.According to Dr. Keller the release of pure DNA is not governed by the German Genetic Engineering Act.So to which extent is the biosafety affected?Moreover, the release of DNA happens permanently.Cell extract is generated by cell disruption, for example via sonification, followed by centrifugation steps in which the cell debris are separated from the molecular machinery needed for CPFS (see CFPS protocols).(2015) who \u0096 by creating an ebola sensor \u0096 showed how cell-free synthetic biology can be a medium to transfer the findings and ideas from the lab to the field.We contacted experts in the field of cell-free biology and asked them about this topic.Biologically/chemically he sees as advantages that the stability, durability and insensibility against external impacts in cell-free systems are considerably higher than in cellular systems.That points out the public awareness when it comes to microbiology and genetically modified organisms.However, none of these problems occur when the system is cell-free.(2013): Preparing synthetic biology for the world.It is also possible to modify the DNA that is used: For example it is conceivable that it includes a kill-switch or comparable safeguards (Moe-Behrens et al.We wondered if it was possible to create a biosensor based on cell extract that is completely cell-free.We consider this a great contribution to the iGEM community.According to Dr. Keller, the uptake of DNA depends on the uptake frequency, the encoded genes (e.g.Therefore, it is important that there are no GMOs in the product.One of those is for example the problem that GMOs are brought outside of the laboratory.PRIA is an in vitro method and can be compared to ELISA, an assay which is broadly used for example in hospitals (Lequin 2005), in terms of biosafety.conferring antibiotic resistance or encoding toxins) and the selection advantage for the transformed cells.Although the cell disruption is very efficient (we had a maximum of 8 colony forming units in 100 \u00b5L of final cell extract), there are still some cells left after this procedure.At first glance, our two approaches the PRIA and CFPS differ when it comes to biosafety concerns.Projects based on cell-free approaches will probably benefit to a great extent from our findings and results.The Act just deals with the handling of GMOs.Sun, PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology explains: \"[...] we have seen both cases where colony forming units come out of the extract and when they don t.\"Although plasmid DNA persists only to a minor degree in host cells (Moe-Behrens et

fields and flourish, and will greatly promote the development of synthetic biology and aerospace engineering \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solving the carbon cycle problem in the space closed-loop system and realizing the recycling of carbon dioxide, not only can provide material guarantee for a long time exploration in deep space for mankind, but also give the method to solve the food crisis and climate problem and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nowadays, the human civilization has achieved unprecedented prosperity.Our previous experience has shown that if we want to build a closed-living bio-regenerative life-support system to realize the material cycling in the space environment, we need to search for the new ideas instand of just simply \u0093add or subtract\" biomass.It is developing the entire circulation system design from the bottom and making full use of the advanced functions among different species, avoiding weaknesses, ultimately achieving material circulation and life support efficiently without any pollution.\"[10] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1960s, several major advanced countries and organizations tried to build a enclosed environment by the Earth s biological regeneration of life support system to simulate material recycling process in space environment.Since 1989, the European Space Agency (ESA) has cooperated with several agencies to launch the MELiSSA, a microecological life support system research program.The ultimate goal is to include multiple compartments to achieve complete closure of the water and gas cycles.we can\u0092t just simply \"add or subtract\" biomass but search for the new ideas,develop the entire circulation system design from the bottom and make full use of the advanced functions among different species, avoid weaknesses, ultimately achieve material circulation and life support efficiently without any pollution.Even the most advanced life support system, the International Space Station (ISS), can only work as a partial closed-loop system, circulating oxygen and controlling pressure.Furthermore, scientists have been neglected the role of microbes in the overall simulation system until they found the important effects of microbes in the entire simulated closed ecosystemlater.Finally, the efficiency of energy utilization and material recycling in natural ecosystems is too low,which requires a large number of ecological space in order to satisfy the astronauts  living requirements (average 100 square meters per person).And the whole story of survival reflects the core idea of the astronauts life support system - recycling everything that can be recycled.Astronauts material consumption reaches 11 tons / year, while the spacecraft to transport 1kg of goods will cost $ 10,000.If Human wants to fly out of the earth like the interstellar travel in science fictions, the primary task is to maintain a reliable system of life support.To solve the complex problems of long-term space travels such as material cycling and life sustainment relying on the existing biological resources of the earth s ecology,we face the challenges including the cost,volume, flexibility and availability.[11] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1970s,the former Soviet Union successfully constructed BIOS-3 enclosed material circulation system, which could achieve 100% of the water cycle and gas circulation.The whole system was completely isolated from the outside air and water, but the system failed to achieve the basic material quality balance, and ultimately failed.For the past half a century of human exploring space, the entire system is basically non-renewable, So it is called Open Loop System.Astronauts can easily obtain a variety of supplies, including food, water and oxygen generators, and achieve the circulation of the waste.It is only performing short-term tasks or in orbit on the International Space Station.Because the biological platform has a self-replicating function and the flexibility biology, there has been a very marginal and mysterious branch, Space Synbio.Space biosynthetic biology will be a catalyst for the development of synthetic biology and the aerospace industry.In 1986, Edward Bass from the USA established a private laboratory, \"Biosphere 2\", to see whether it can create a completely closed life-support system, and all the lives in system live in harmony.Manned space flight only reached the moon from the time when the first human rocket was launched.At present, space exploration continues to expand, from near-Earth orbit to deep space exploration, from landing the moon to Mars survival which may come true in the future.However, due to the neglect of themicroorganisms,which isa very important loop in the system,the closed experiment only lasted for two weeks in such system.The platform of synthetic biology ensures that the search process is more reliable.[7] In this process, it is difficult to bring all the air, food and water needed.From 1968 the release of \"2001 space roaming\", so far, most of the ideas in the film have been realized, except for the space roaming.Artificial simulation is difficult to achieve.The second is that the stability of the natural ecosystem is based on the huge biomass,but the one of the small-scale simulation system is frail.Designing the travel plans to go to the moon and Mars or even further place is very different.He used human excrement, Mars soil and the water from rocket explosion to grow potatoes.University of California, Berkeley, Adam P. Arkin summed up six major challenges of the space The challenge can give people the power to innovate and inspire imagination.Over the past 20 years, we have cut down over 130 million hectares of forest, but only get 47.5 million hectares of arable lands [2].Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project[J].In the film, Mark lived in the desolate Mars, making the environment in cabin similar with the Earth.Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 2015, 12(113).ARC (Ames Research Center) defines space synthesis biology as a subject that provides reliable biological tools and techniques to sustain human activities in space, reduces the risk of space exploration, and drives some hypothesis-driven research.The six grand challenges of space synthetic

million-years evolution.The interaction among different organisms is very complex.Then humans can survive.A famous line from the movie:\"I gotta science the shit out of this planet.[9] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Facing the closed system of spacecraft, how to maximize the utilization of material and energy recycling in order to maintain the long-term space activities for astronauts has became an unavoidable and insurmountable problem for scientists.", "description": "We hope to use E.coli to realize the re-use of carbon dioxide metabolized by astronauts, like green leaf, and to synthesize Glycogen which can be reused by astronauts,using formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.This is the part that connects the front and the back of the entire Blue Leaf project, and also determines whether the entire device can be used to synthesize starch with a carbon compound as the sole carbon source.The route cannot synthesize Glycogen with only one carbon compound as the sole carbon source, and is not suitable for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.In the first part, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.The device,which can maintain the carbon cycle in the long-term spacecraft,is what we call the Blue Leaf.This year, we focus on the issue of carbon cycling in spaceships during long-term space travel.Our wet experiments also also focused on the validation of this pathway and the efficient expression as well as the catalysis of both enzymes.Figue4, Part II, New Synthesis of D-xylulose by Formaldehyde Assimilation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third part, Glycogen Metabolism can be used to synthsize D-xylulose into Glycogen.The use of mature carbon dioxide fixation technology turns the carbon dioxide in the air into formic acid[3], and then gets formaldehyde which is the sole carbon source by specific enzyme.[5] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, in order to enhance the efficiency of the combined catalysis, we used synthetic protein scaffolds technology[6].The second part is the new formaldehyde condensation pathway which can achieve the efficient synthesis of D-xylulose from formaldehyde.[1] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last year, the iGEM team AACHEN2015 used E.coli to design a pathway for Glycogen by methanol.However, the five carbon compound needs to be obtained by E. coli from other glycolytic pathways.Though they aimed at using methanol to form glycogen, in fact,they overlooked one of the most important aspects![4]Figue3, Part I, Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide.[2]They used electric conversion to get methanol,which is the raw material.From the 1960s, the former Soviet Union, the United States, the European Union and other space organizations have tried to construct bio-regenerating life-support system under earth  s closed environment in order to simulate the material recycling process in space environment.The former can turn formaldehyde condensation into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and hydroxyacetaldehyde.The latter condenses two intermediate products into a five carbon sugars Compounds: D-xylulose.This year, we have designed a new carbon cycle system.In other words, E. coli must consume at least one molecule of six carbon sugar to synthesize a glycogen hexose sugar monomer.\"Rapid Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by an Iridium Pincer Catalyst Immobilized on Carbon Nanotube Electrodes.\"We have optimized the protein scaffold sequence and performed functional validation on the basis of the iGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team.For a closed system such as a spacecraft, how to maximize the recycling efficiency of material and energy in order to maintain the astronauts\u0092 long-term space activities has become an inescapable but difficult problem for scientists to overcome.", "design": "But this idea about utilizing the Methanol Condensation Cycle and Glycogen Metabolism into the synthesis of glycogen has stimulated us greatly.To synthesize Glycogen in the presence of one-carbon compound as the sole carbon source, we need to find or even design a new pathway for the synthesis of five carbon saccharide from formaldehyde.A simple and effective method for the complex reaction involved with so many enzymes should be found to enhance the interaction and cooperation within each enzyme and improve the efficiency of the overall reaction.The toxicity of the formaldehyde is high and unstable, especially for the cells.The synthesis of glycogen was achieved by using the synthetic route of formaldehyde to D-xylulose, the partial methanol assimilation pathway and glycogen metabolic pathway.Figue 6, Formic acid to formaldehyde conversion pathway.[4] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We improved the scaffold protein on the basis of the IGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team[5] and used it in our designed pathway-from formaldehyde to D-xylulose.Thus, based on the ways to fix the carbon dioxide by electro-transformation, a one-carbon product with low toxicity and high electro-conversion efficiency should be found, and then we design the pathway of it to assimilate.Though this new approach, we have achieved the synthesis of D-xylulose by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.It is beneficial for the synthesis of carbohydrates to use formic acid as carbon source.However, in this synthetic pathway, an obvious defect lies on the additional requirement of a five-carbon sugar used together with methanol and then to form glycogen.This route aforementioned cannot be used to synthesize Glycogen only with one carbon compound as the carbon source, so as to be deficient for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.Besides, we applied this part in our scaffold protein(BBa_K2155012) with other cohesins, and proved it was functional.Figue 4, CO2 Reduction Thermodynamics & The Strategy of Hydrogenation of CO2 to Formic Acid.This part is \u0093Bearing before and after\u0094 part in Blue Leaf as well as the determined factor of whether the entire device can achieve the synthesis of starch by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.In order to improve the efficiency of the multi-enzyme reaction system, Self-assembly Protein Scaffold was used.It transforms methanol into formaldehyde that will be condensed into six-carbon sugar with five-carbon sugar produced in E. coli, and then goes to the subsequent glycogen polymerization.Since the photosynthesis efficiency of plant is only about 1%[1] , it is clearly not a practical way to use the green leaves to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft where the space is narrow while the demand for energy is huge.The scaffold protein consists of the following components:Figue 3, Synthetic protein scaffolds improve the efficiency of multi - enzyme reaction.Last year, the iGEM team from Aachen University of Technology in Germany[2] designed a synthetic pathway for Glycogen with the methanol from E.coli and finally won the Best manufacture prize.The system, in other words, will convert carbon dioxide into the sugar compounds offering heat supply, so as to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft and ensure the astronauts  long-term space travel or space presence.Based on a registered cohesin(BBa_K1830004) submitted byiGEM15_Concordia\u0092s, we isolated the cohesin module of this part from the linker, which makes following team could adjust linker\u0092s length according to their requirement when they use this cohesin.In the next route, we used Methanol Condensation Cycle.Design a system to achieve the re-use of carbon dioxide in the spacecraft.D-xylulose was phosphorylated to 5-phosphate-xylulose and then went into the methanol assimilation pathway.We found two enzymes with different condensation functions, BFD and TalB , the former could condense formaldehyde into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and Glycolaldehyde.In this way, the target protein could be anchored firmly to the scaffold.Therefore, the linker\u0092s length is a main influence of multi-enzyme system\u0092s reaction efficiency.Amazingly, the conversion efficiency could be more than 80%.Cohesins were expressed on the scaffold, while Dockerins co-expressed with the target enzyme to form a fusion protein.Microscopically, it could automatically assemble the fusion protein with the corresponding Dockerin, making different enzymes next to each other.We know that complex enzyme reaction often has a problem that the products of the last enzyme cannot be timely and competely transported to the next enzyme, making the overall reaction efficiency low due to the location of different enzymes in the space far apart.There are few pathways of formic acid assimilation in nature, and we have searched through the literature to find a path that has been validated.In the case of Blue Leaf, a system in which multiple enzymes catalyze the reaction, the efficiency of the coordinated reaction between the enzymes determines the efficiency of the overall catalytic reaction.Cohesins and Dockerins were the major components of protein scaffolds, each with a reactive group that recognizes each other and mosaics.They got the methanol,which is the raw material, through the electric conversion.[8] Moreover, the toxicity of formate is much lower than that of methanol.So our experiments also focused on the validation of this pathway and the efficient expression and the efficient catalysis of both enzymes.From the macroscopic point of view, it can improve the local enzyme concentration and substrate concentration, thereby enhancing the multi-enzyme reaction system.\u0093Computational Protein Design Enables a Novel One-Carbon Assimilation Pathway.\u0094 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 112(12): 3704\u00969.It is clear that formic acid is more suitable as a sustainable carbon source than methanol.[9]Figue 5, Investigator Peng Kang, from TIPC

activation.In this system, the sgRNA can be targeted to any site that contains a PAM sequence, and when placed upstream of a promoter, it will upregulate transcription of the gene downstream.As both of these origins rely on iterons as the negative copy number control, the competition between the plasmids may render them incompatible when in the same cell[1], potentially limiting triple transformation efficiency.However, by successfully triple transforming the three plasmids, all containing the RFP gene J04450, we demonstrate that the plasmids can be used simultaneously in a single construct.Furthermore, where the sensing regions in the current sgRNA design are sensitive to an RNA analogue, it is a proof of concept that the system activates in the presence of specific RNA.If this system were transposed to mammalian cells, multiple controllable gene expression could be the start of a renaissance in mammalian genetic engineering.In this way it would be possible to have a single cell detect multiple stimuli, outputting different reporters for each stimuli, for example, a cell that fluoresces red in the presence of lead, and green in the presence of mercury.The dCas9  reads  the 20nt targeting region at the 5  end of the sgRNA, guiding it to a location adjacent to a PAM that is complimentary to the targeting region.Our RNA binding protein (RBP) is fused to an effector protein that ordinarily upregulates the transcription of nearby genes with appropriate promotors.The handle can be reformed upon the introduction of a specific single stranded RNA that binds, changing the conformation of the sgRNA.We hope this will make it available to less economically developed countries as a frontline diagnostic tool and make a real impact in the fight against infectious diseases and pollution.The single guide RNA (sgRNA) gene that forms part of plasmid 3 when expressed, forms a stand of RNA with a designed secondary structure.As a result, we decided to make our research findings available to the wider iGEM community, so that any teams in the future pursuing similar projects may have greater confidence in aspects of their designs.In order to test whether triple transformations using biobrick standard plasmids was possible, we selected three biobrick plasmids differing significantly in copy number and antibiotic resistance.When a metal ion binds to the aptamer, the aptamer changes conformation, exposing the previously bound RNA in the 20nt targeting site and dCas9 handle.This binding will cause a conformational change such that the dCas9 enzyme may bind upstream of the transcriptional start site of a fluorescent reporter gene inducing transcription.This de-represses the dCas9 action, allowing the system to activate expression of the reporter gene.As our sensor is RNA based, any form of aptamer can be made compatible with the system.For our current system, we are aiming to target Leptospirosis, aiding in the diagnosis of this disease.However, from data gathered by the Warwick iGEM team in 2015, and further sequencing completed by the registry, a mutation in the origin of replication was identified that caused the copy number to be significantly higher than the recorded value.Upon evaluation, the team decided that synthesizing a modular biosensor detection kit would be most influential, due to the potential application to a wide range of diseases and environmental health issues.The CRISPR/Cas9 system will have guided the dCas9 to bind upstream of the transcription start site for the reporter gene, e.g.The effector domain is linked to the binding domain via a glycine-serine linker, a flexible length of amino acids that allows the effector to dangle freely when the RBP has bound to the appropriate stem loop structure on the sgRNA.Once the fusion protein is expressed, it can bind to the complementary binding region on the sgRNA.The dCas9 enzyme has a binding domain that targets the dCas9 handle on the sgRNA, resulting in a strong binding with high affinity.While the system is currently designed to detect mercury and lead, by modifying the aptamers it can become sensitive to any compound which an aptamer exists to bind to it.We are also looking into incorporating metal aptamers into the design such that our sensor can detect hazardous levels of heavy metals, creating a portable paper-based water monitor.Incorporating a metal aptamer in the 5  end of the sgRNA in such a way that it prevents the binding of dCas9 to the sgRNA, allows this metal sensing to occur.On the other half of the plates, we streaked a colony of top10 cells that had been grown on a streptomycin plate.By editing the RBP handle so that it reforms in the presence of sRNA from bacteria, it becomes possible to create a detection kit for bacterial infection.By modifying the structure of the sgRNA so that the RBP handle is misfolded under normal conditions, the activation of the reporter gene becomes dependent on the refolding of this handle.Figure 2: Full colour image of the triple transformed and untransformed Top10 cells plated on three different antibioticsFigure 3: A UV light image of the same plates, clearly showing the difference between the cultivated transformed and untransformed cells.References[1] http://openwetware.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli/Vectors, 19/10/16Our detection system for infectious agents and environmental pollutants will be based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology, relying on conformational changes in an RNA-based sensor that will trigger transcriptional regulation by a dCas9 protein.The last plasmid, pSB4A5, is listed as having a low copy number in the registry.Whilst planning our project, we decided that the use of three interacting plasmids would be the most optimal method of deploying our device.We found that only minimal information was available on the iGEM registry concerning this subject, as each plasmid had only been characterised individually, and few teams had ever attempted triple transformations as an integral part of their work.Afterwards, the sensor will be freeze-dried onto a paper scaffold for ease of use.In the registry, pSB1C3 is listed as having a high copy number of 200 copies, and pSB3T5 a medium copy number of around 20 copies.Lyme disease, although not at the forefront of discussion, was the inceptive focus of the investigation, as current detection methods can only be applied after debilitating symptoms have manifested.The RBP-effector fusion recognises the stem loop structure present in the sgRNA and binds adjacent to the dCas9.This system could also selected to activate multiple genes in response to a single stimuli.We decided to investigate the function of the bio brick standard plasmids further, in order to ascertain whether it was possible to clone three plasmids into the same competent cells.Through this system, it is possible with small changes to create a simple detection system that is capable of taking single inputs and activating multiple genes.The adaptable nature of the bio-detector could allow replacement of the expensive antibody-reliant detection systems currently used.", "design": "As our target is upstream of the promoter region of our reporter, by placing the RNA binding protein motif further towards the 3  end of the gRNA it is placed closer to the promoter region, potentially aiding the fusion protein in activating the expression of the gene.Single guide or cr/tracr RNA The first design decision we made was whether to use the CRISPR system as it appears in nature - where the crRNA that selects the target for the Cas9 to bind to, and the tracrRNA, that allows the Cas9 to bind to the gRNA are two separate entities \u0096 or to fuse the crRNA and tracrRNA into a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that combines the function of both and is now the standard in CRISPR research.By guiding the protein near its promoter site, we hope to increase the rate of transcription of the gene far over its background transcription rate.The fusion protein is designed to include the relevant domains from each of the two fused proteins and a glycine-serine linker providing flexibility between the domains so that the effector can act semi-independently of the RNA binding domain.In order to control the expression of our reporter, and minimise background activation, our promoters were designed specifically to reduce their efficiency under normal conditions.The crRNA binds with trans activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), forming the full guide RNA (gRNA).Cas9 enzyme binds to the Cas9 handle on the tracrRNA section of the gRNA.The Cas9 enzyme compares the 20nt section of the crRNA against multiple places on the bacteriophage genome, binding when it finds a complimentary section next to a NGG-3  section called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).The Cas9 enzymes expresses dual nuclease functionality, cutting both strands of the DNA it identifies.The bacteriophage genome is cleaved by Cas9 preventing successful infection of the host cell.This system can be modified by synthetic biologist to allow targeted DNA cutting.The reporter gene we are using is GFP, that when activated produces a green fluorescent protein that is measurable as a colour change in the cell.We are testing 3 different effector proteins, and 3 different RNA binding domains in order to maximise activation by comparing activity between 9 different effector-RNABP fusions.This was introduced to prevent interference with the binding of either protein by the presence of the other.In order to make the system activate only upon the detection of specific foreign RNA (dubbed sRNA), the structure of either the Cas9 handle, crRNA region, or the RNA binding motif must be disrupted when no sRNA is present.However there are multiple developments in CRISPR technology to reduce the level of off-target binding: reducing the length of the crRNA can lower off-target binding by reducing overall binding efficiency; or using two single-strand cutting Cas9 targeting opposite strands at the same site to create the double strand cut so that two systems need to fail before an off-target cut occurs.We elected to use CRISPR/Cas9 as the DNA targeting system in our device over using more conventional DNA binding proteins due to the inherently modular nature of CRISPR.The gRNA was capped at the 3  end with a E. coli terminator.A nucleotide linker was added between the RNA binding motif and the Cas9 handle-terminator structure in order to introduce physical space between the binding sites of the dCas9 enzyme and the RNA binding protein.The criteria used to choose the proteins were their use in previous working systems, their tropism in nature, and the strength of the RNA binding.RNA Binding ProteinsThe RNA binding protein (RBP) recognises and binds to a specific RNA sequence.For this we used Nupack to design and fold our gRNA within specification to prevent unnecessary modification to the basic gRNA system that we know works.RNA Binding Protein MotifsIn order to create our detection system it was necessary to add RNA binding protein motifs to the gRNA.The idea of CRISPR/Cas9 activation in prokaryotes is feasible, however, the execution of the idea is more complex than in eukaryotes - a reversal of the usual roles.In eukaryotes, its a simple matter of fusing the RNA binding protein with a chromatin modifier, increasing the transcription and subsequent translation of the target genes.These factors contribute to the strong binding strength of T7RNAP to its consensus promoter, making it suitable for our needs.http://www.pnas.org/content/109/18/7085.fullhttp://mds.marshall.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1112? factor Omega protein is a subunit of the core RNA polymerase enzyme.By combining the crRNA and tracrRNA into a single guide RNA (sgRNA), editing is simplified and further secondary structures can be added to the sgRNA further altering the function of the system.Then in the presence of sRNA the structure must then reform.Based on our previous issues with maintaining the structure of the Cas9 handle, it as decided that the structure of the RNA binding motif would be disrupted.From this it was decided that attempting to reform either the Cas9 handle or the RNA binding protein motif was unlikely.GFP is a fairly small protein, only 26.9 kDa in size, and from previous experiences throughout iGEM it does not harm the cell through expression.Malachite green aptamer is a small RNA strand that itself is not fluorescent, however in the presence of the organic compound malachite green it forms a complex fluorescing brightly.As the desired binding site can be changed, sgRNAs can be designed easily and cheaply to allow complementary binding to the majority of sequences within the genome.Simultaneous transcription \u0096 as the targeting of Cas9 is programmable, we can design for targeting of multiple sites within the same system.However, as with many existing methods, there are some drawbacks to this form of gene editing.This RNA motif is present in our extended sgRNA molecule that interacts with the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting upstream of the promoter of the gene to be activated.http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v15/n1/full/nsmb1327.htmlCOM ProteinCom protein originates in the Mu bacteriophage where it acts as a regulator of mom protein mRNA by binding 5  to the open reading frame, altering the RNA structure of the mRNA exposing the translation start site.Genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 can range from single base changes, to insertion or deletion of entire genes.Target DNA sequence is identified and a complementary strand of gRNA is designed.Cas9 enzyme binds to the gRNA, targeting it towards a specific DNA sequence.Cas9 enzyme cuts both strands of the double-stranded DNA.When the cell detects the damage inflicted upon the DNA by the dCas9, it attempts to repair the two strands.Genome mutations induced by flaws in cell DNA repair mechanisms results in a base changes due to non-homologous end joining.Introducing sections of DNA with similar ends to both sides of the cut allows homology-directed repair to occur, allowing the insertion of the introduced DNA into the cut site.Advantages and Disadvantages of CRISPR Technologies in Gene EditingCRISPR technology is one of the most recently developed gene editing tools.If we were to use a two-part system, the tracrRNA would the only part that needed to be modified with the extra stem and loop structure to incorporate the binding motif.As the nature of our detection system requires activation and regulation of transcription, not strand cutting, we use a deactivated version of the Cas9 enzyme \u0096 dCas9.It is a small (~ 20 base pairs) modifiable RNA sequence composed of two parts: target-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and auxiliary trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA).The CRISPR-Cas9 System: Step by Step DNA Cutting in Nature A bacteriophage infects a bacteria, inflicting damage that the cell survives.It essentially acts as a pair of scissors that cut the double-stranded DNA at the target location, enabling editing at a specific point within the genomeThe guide RNA (gRNA) The single stranded gRNA ensures that the Cas9 enzyme cuts the genome in the correct location.By adding the aptamer to the 3  end of the sgRNA it can bind to the crRNA preventing activity, and as it is only within the proximity of a single structure it is less likely to cause structural issues when ions bind.The sgRNA, and by extension the RNABP-effector fusion, is guided to the target gene by a nuclease-deficient Cas9 enzyme (dCas9).This simplifies the system in a setting where multiple target sites are required to be activated by the same trigger, as multiple crRNAs could be encoded targeting different sites while a single tracrRNA that is sensitive to a single trigger is maintained.Considering the modifications it is necessary to make to the gRNA in order to combine it with RNA binding protein motifs it is worth considering both option.The RNA binding motif could then be appended to the 3  end of the gRNA without affecting the rest of the gRNA structure.A modified version of this coat protein is commonly used for MS2 tagging, a method of RNA detection in living cells where the MS2 coat protein is fused with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) allowing the visualisation of mRNA.The RNA binding proteins that we ultimately selected for experimentation were taken from the Zalatan paper, where they were fused with chromatin modifying proteins and targeted towards the 3  end of the gRNA.The strongly binding nature of the MS2 to the RBS makes this protein suitable for inclusion in our system.This was done by introducing a stretch of RNA between the first terminator loop and the binding motif that would bind to the nucleotides making up the motif disrupting the structure.The paper based sensor in our design consists of a freeze-dried transcription/translation system that contains the genes encoding our device and the compounds that allow it to report activation, while being able to be stored en masse in dry areas at room temperature.In order to determine the optimum concentration of malachite green that causes clear fluorescence over background fluorescence while not damaging the cells, the aptamer was characterised by the team.In order to test our system in vivo, GFP was selected as the primary reporter gene, however, further down the line, when the device is expressed in an in vitro transcription/translation system mounted on filter paper it is worth revisiting the issue.This allows us to test different binding sites upstream of the promoter in order to determine at what distance activation is at its highest.The reporter gene is expressed when the system activates gene expression successfully.The correct structure of the Cas9 handle returned upon returning the S. pyrogenes terminator.However, when placing the RNA binding protein motif between the Cas9 handle and the S. pyrogenes terminator, the structure of the handle was once again disrupted.This was based on the binding of Cas9 to its target site.Our CRISPR system will incorporate these RNA sequences in the gRNA, enabling the RBP to specifically target the site where the dCas9 has bound.When the sRNA is introduced to the system, these complimentary regions (dubbed sensing regions) would bind to the sRNA, preventing the disrupting region from binding to the motif, allowing the motif to reform its original structure.These factors make T7 RNAP an excellent choice for an activator protein in our project.The groove on the enzyme surface provides the main binding site for DNA.This difference provides some variety in the RNA binding proteins we are testing while maintaining specificity and binding strength.The recognition specificity of the PP7 coat protein differs only slightly from that of the MS2 RNA binding protein previously described, targeting a larger stem loop instead with different nucleotide compositions in the loop.But, forming a structure with the aptamer and the crRNA region similarly prevents sgRNA activity and 3  additions to the sgRNA do not affect Cas9 binding.Its binding differs from that of PP7 and MS2 RNA binding proteins by the location of its binding in the RNA hairpin.As a fundamental part of our system, designing our gRNA within specifications is very important for ensuring the function of the device.With the introduction of RNA aptamers that can potentially bind a multitude of compounds, it becomes possible to create a detection system for each of those compounds by only modifying the gRNA while maintaining the rest of the system.The Cas9 enzyme can also be edited to reduce its nuclease action so that it only cuts a single strand of the target DNA, or eliminate it entirely so that it acts more as a targetable DNA binding enzyme.T7 RNA polymerase is orthogonal to native transcription and the T7 promoters are tightly off in the absence of the controller, ensuring that only the desired effector gene will be transcribed.Despite these potential complications, the otherwise simple nature of modifying prokaryotes make E. coli a suitable chassis.Escherichia coli was selected over chassis such as yeast, which the Zalatan paper used, due to it being a well documented and characterised chassis in synthetic biology, and it s ease of use for transformations as well as its low doubling time, allowing us to increase our throughput and efficiency.In nature, the coat protein binds a particular RNA stem loop structure in the shine-delgarno sequence of the phage replicase locus in the MS2 genome, preventing translation once the cell becomes saturated with coat protein.The bacteria digests the bacteriophage DNA, producing a copy of a 20nt section of the bacteriophage genome and incorporating it into a CRIPSR array within the bacteria s genome as a protospacer.A recurrence of infection from the same bacteriophage triggers a response from the bacteria.The bacteria compares the DNA from the bacteriophage against the CRISPR array, expressing the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that matches.In nature, the gRNA is found as two single stranded RNA that bind have complimentary sites.The binding energy of the disrupting region must be greater than the binding energy ====of the motif, and the binding energy of both sensing regions must be greater than that of the disrupting region.The previous system works only for detecting sRNA.For example, if in response one form of foreign RNA the system needed to activate expression of GFP, but in response to another RNA the system needed to activate expression of RFP, sgRNA are the preferred choice.Selecting An Activation Method/Activation of Genes Using CRISPR/Cas9Our system of gene activation consists of 3 parts that interact and guide activation to specific regions of the E. coli genome.In papers it has been shown that modifying the 5  end of the gRNA, past the 20nt crRNA region, does not negatively affect the binding or activity of Cas9.The CRISPR-Cas9 system has two constituent parts: The Cas9 enzyme This is the \u0091active part\u0092 of the system.If the sgRNA is not fully complementary to the DNA sequence, it may be unable to bind, preventing the required transcription of the gene.For this purpose we designed a sequence ahead of the promoter containing multiple PAM sites and PAM proximal regions that are individually targetable with little similarity between regions, reducing the risk of off-target binding within this area.One of the key features of our detection system is it\u0092s easily altered modular nature.As a result we have elected to use sgRNA as the basis for our detection system.When designing our sgRNA we came across the problem of selecting terminator loops.This prevents the cleavage of the double stranded DNA, but still allows binding to the specific target site.Paper based sensing has been tested on diagnosis kits for Zika virus and Ebola, it is only natural that the technology becomes cheaper over time so that more and more diseases will be diagnosable by these tests.For this we needed to select a reporter whose expression is easily measured, is a fairly small gene reducing load on the cell, and does not harm the cell when expressed.In order to detect metal ions, incorporating a metal ion aptamer that disrupts the structure of the sgRNA under normal circumstances and reforms the structure when a metal ion binds was necessary.However it was unfeasible to use any RNA folding prediction program to predict the folding of the metal aptamer when the metal has bound.Using sgRNA each target site and Cas9 handle / RNA binding motif would need to be expressed as a single RNA increasing the workload of designers in cases where multiple sgRNA are expressed.Furthermore, in systems where individual responses are tied to the stimuli, using sgRNA would be far better, as cross activation of one targeted site across sgRNAs is extremely unlikely.In the original CRISPR/Cas9 system, the gRNA contains a S. pyrogenes terminator at the 3  end of the gRNA.The crRNA could be kept the same in the case of RNA detection, or modified separately to include a metal aptamer domain.However we encountered multiple design decisions while incorporating these motifs into the CRISPR/Cas9 system.When Cas9 binds, it binds with the 5  end of the gRNA upstream of the target.An additional six hydrogen bonds between three enzymatic residues (one threonine and two arginine) and the unpaired bases in the uncoiled DNA molecule further increases binding strength.As this type of activation has not been attempted before, there is little data on the ideal position upstream of the promoter in which to bind our dCas9-sgRNA-RNABP-effector complex.The activation is done by effector proteins that are guided to the gene that reports the activation.Further nucleotides were introduced at either end of this disrupting sequence that were complimentary to the sRNA that was to be detected.By bringing this enzyme closer to the transcription start site of the reporter gene, it will facilitate transcription of the gene by stabilising any RNAP complex that forms around it.This was eventually worked around by maintaining the Cas9 handle-terminator structure while truncating four uracil from the S. pyrogenes terminator loop, preventing proper transcription termination.MS2 Phage Coat ProteinThe bacteriophage MS2 is a virus infecting E. coli and other members of the Enterobacteriacea family.In order to guide the effector protein it is fused to a RNA binding protein (RNABP) that recognises and binds a specific RNA motif.We elected to place the motifs between the Cas9 handle and the terminator loop.In the majority of previous research, the role of dCas9 as a repressor has been analysed.As well as these surface interactions, there is partial Pi-Pi stacking within the folds of the polymerase structure itself, specifically between multiple T7RNAP aromatic amino acids and the unpaired DNA bases.Furthermore it has been shown that adding nucleotide linkers between the Cas9 handle and the terminator loop of the tracrRNA similarly does not negatively impact Cas9 activity.However when we modeled the folding of the terminator in Nupack we found that the removal of the S. pyrogenes terminator affected the folding of the Cas9 handle.The aptamer is only 38 bp long, meaning it inflicts very little pressure on the cell minimising cell load, however the malachite green compound is known to be toxic to cells in sufficient concentration.Given that this field of research is relatively new, we were excited by the concept of investigating potential novel applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.We elected to use Escherichia coli as our chassis organism.Sigma-54 in nature in encoded by the rpoN gene that is an important regulator of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism.In order to measure the expression of the malachite green aptamer, malachite green compound must first be added.It is the smallest subunit in the RNAP complex, where it stabilises the assembled enzyme.", "human_practice": "We also considered further

potassium for example, interferes with the detection of lead.We arranged a future consultation with Dr Brooks to discuss our technology further, and after conferring with the rest of the team, made the executive decision to alter the primary target of our sensor.Collaborating with members of Public Health England combined with the analysis of collected data led us to conclude that when detecting for Lyme disease, an in vivo form of our sensor would be most appropriate.Dr Embers identified several issues with the current system - these tests are not specific or sensitive enough to diagnose patients at all phases of the disease, antigenic variability may prevent antibody recognition and western blots have a degree of inaccuracy when detecting the antibodies present.Dr Brooks emphasised how useful our sensor would be for detection of leptospirosis \u0096 a bacteria commonly detected in the blood samples RIPL test, with the paper-based aspect making it very well-suited to the developing countries where this disease prevails.This reagent specifically binds and masks potassium and sodium ions in solution, preventing their interaction with our sensor and reducing the chance of false positives.This year, two members of the Warwick iGEM team attended the annual Lyme Disease Association conference was held at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge University.She discussed the different factors considered before a policy can be issued, and how this procedure is currently being applied to Lyme disease.Dr Sandra Pearson, Lyme Disease Action, tackled the issue of Borrelia persistence, followed by Dr Monica Embers, from the Tulane National Primate Research Centre, who had modelled the changes in immune response over the course of infection and post treatment using rhesus macaques.After discussing the advantages and limitations of the current serology and PCR diagnostic tests, we proposed our paper-based sensor and explained the testing procedure.Following this, we arranged to facilitate discussions with patients, researchers, and students in secondary education.The opportunity to interact with and get to know other teams and their projects, along with the fantastic talks given by a variety of speakers, made the meet-up a very enjoyable and beneficial experience.We were very fortunate to speak to David Lloyd, CEO of FredSense Technologies - a leading biosensor company based in Canada.He acknowledged the usefulness of a more robust, faster detection system, but shared some reservations concerning our intended method for sample testing \u0096 Borrelia bacteria are very rarely present in the blood at a high enough concentration for detection through traditional techniques.To tackle these problems, the team proposed a colorimetric sensing system that could be supplied to charities and governmental aid associations.To tackle these problems, the team proposed a colorimetric sensing system that could be supplied to charities and governmental aid associations.The advantages of using paper-based sensing over in vivo are the ease of use, stability and cost, however, if our system is used in clinics in developed areas, these benefits become secondary to concerns over sensitivity.By encouraging us to consider the different environments in which our device could be applied, and further involving herself by researching potential solutions, she influenced the development of the physical composition of our device and method of delivery.Gurpreet expressed a keen interest in the different methods that could be applied when constructing our sensor in order to make it most suitable for use by a wide demographic.The RIPL act as the governmental body for acute diagnostic facilities for a wide range of diseases in the UK, including zoonotic vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease.He was able to advise our team with regards to the business side of our project.He was able to advise our team with regards to the business side of our project.According to Dr Shan, the pilot study indicated the novel diagnostic test had a 75% senstivity and 100% specificity on serum samples as small as 400 \u00b5l, as well as being able to distinguish between Lyme and relapsing fever Borrelia strains.Being able to interact with research specialists, GP\u0092s and actual Lyme disease sufferers was a fantastic opportunity to gauge first-hand the opinions of different demographics in response to our project.The theme of the conference was \u0091Moving Forward\u0092, and focused on the progress that Lyme disease research has made.The first speaker was Dr Norma O\u0092Flynn from the National Guideline Centre, elaborating upon the procedure applied by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, when determining management processes to improve health and social care.In developed areas, and when used by appropriately trained professionals, the benefits regarding sensitivity when using in vivo detection outweigh any negative aspects.We fully understand the importance of understanding different perspectives and considering different opinion, hence why we have devoted a large amount of effort to corresponding with members of the public and incorporating feedback.Over the course of the project, we were assisted by Gurpreet, a Nuffield Bursary Student from Whitley Academy in Coventry currently entering her 2nd year of sixth form.Dr Embers also discussed her research into the challenges of diagnosing and curing Lyme disease.She reviewed the current testing methods for diagnosis \u0096 with early serology tests including IFA, ELISA, western blots and PCR, and later stage diagnostics testing for antigens/antibodies in CSF, urine and the blood.However, he did warn that colour is subjective, and so for application within more developed areas, such as supplying environmental consultancies, we determined that a more quantitative measurement would be more helpful.However, he

issues that had become apparent with the Wiki page.The primary reason the Warwick team selected to develop a new detection system was the opportunity to contribute to improving the quality of human life.On Wednesday the 17th of August, Warwick iGEM travelled up to Westminster University to attend a two-day event, along with 16 other teams from around the UK.After being welcomed to the University of Westminster by Dean Professor Jane Lewis, the event began with a question and answer session with Dr Markiv \u0096 a spokesperson for iGEM.", "modeling": "This process yielded the following

RNABP + Eff3) T0?sgRNA? sgRNA + Leptospirosis RNA4) sgRNA + dCas9 + RNABP/Eff ? dCas9*5) dCas9* + Plasmid 1 ? Plasmid 1* 6) RNABP/Effector + RNA Polymerase ?

GFPODEs from this reaction scheme:Model for GFP Production:Key: T0 = Starting time, dCas9 = deactivated Cas9, RNABP = RNA Binding Protein, Eff = Effector, GFP = Green fluorescent Protein, KA = Association constant, h = Hill coefficient, A = Active RNA PolymeraseThe ODEs were derived by applying the law of mass action to the reaction scheme.The values that we obtained were used to provide the illustrations shown in figures 4, 5 and 6.These illustrations don\u0092t really match how we expect our system to operate and we feel that this could be down to any of the following reasons:-The parameters obtained from the literature, although partially relevant, are not accurate parameters when used to model our system, as they may have been obtained in different conditions to those that our system operates in (e.g in vivo as opposed to in vitro)-Our model does not account for all of the molecule reactions that occur while our system is sensing RNAFor our model to be fully characterised and tested for robustness, further experiments will need to be conducted, in order to determine the appropriate reaction constants.Shown in the table below are the parameters used to generate the illustrations of the ideal case and realistic case.Figure 1: Graph of Ideal behaviour - Timespan 100 secondsFigure 2: Graph of Ideal behaviour - Timespan 500 secondsFigure 3: graph of Ideal Behaviour - Timespan 10000 secondsFigure 4: Graph of Realistic Behaviour - Timespan 0.5 secondsFigure 5: Graph of Realistic Behaviour - Timespan 100 secondsFigure 6: Graph of Realistic Behaviour - Timespan 10000000 secondsA stunning testament to the modularity of our system is the fact that we could adapt it to also have the ability to detect metal ions in an environment.Once all of the \u0091fC\u0092 molecules are formed, then molecules of the full GFP activation complex \u0091A\u0092 are formed and in turn GFP production \u0091P\u0092 begins.After having produced illustrations of the ideal behaviour of our system, we decided to try and parameterise our model using values from the literature, as we were unable to determine them experimentally.We will now explain the process that we went through to refine our reaction scheme, in the hope that future iGEM teams may learn from our mistakes or improve on our model.Initially, we constructed a reaction scheme that showed step by step what would happen when our system is detecting Leptospirosis, in the case where the Leptospirosis RNA is present.When the dCas9/sgRNA complex is bound to Plasmid 1, the dCas9 molecule then acts as a beacon for the RNA binding protein with the attached effector to find the sgRNA and bind to it.When the previous binding process is complete, the RNA binding protein/effector recruits an RNA polymerase, allowing it to read the gene for GFP production present on Plasmid 1.The sensing process would be slightly different but use of dCas9 would be the same.At the start of the sensing process for metal ions, a folded sgRNA of our design will be present in abundance in the environment that we will be attempting to sense a metal ion within.It was possible for our full activation complex to be formed in different orders.For example, it was possible for our sgRNA to bind to the plasmid before or after it had bound the RNA binding protein.This reaction scheme assumed that only one process could happen at a time.General ODEs derived from this reaction scheme:We felt that the second reaction scheme was a lot more accurate with regards to representing our system.How the system works/What parts we decided to model?For us to be able to model our system, we had to establish what we thought would be happening while our device was in action.It only showed what would happen with our system in the ideal case, being that everything formed at the right time and in the right order with Leptospirosis RNA present in the system.When the sgRNA is in its original shape, the handle is not accessible to the dCAs9, however, if there is Leptospirosis RNA present in the environment, it will bind to the sgRNA, changing its shape and allowing the dCAs9 to bind to it.The dCas9/sgRNA complex is guided back to Plasmid 1 by the dCas9 component.Initially the sgRNA is folded in such a way that the dCas9 handle is obstructed by another part of the sgRNA molecule so the dCas9 molecule will be unable to bind.The sgRNA molecules that we designed also have a site to which metal ions could bind to.For example, an equation of the form:Will yield the following ODEs representing the rate of change of the concentrations of the reactants:Where \u0091k\u0092 represents the association/dissociation constant of the reactants.In most cases, the binding of a ligand to a molecule is aided when there are already other ligand present so the hill function is used to model gene regulation when there are already other ligands present (i.e.The hill function becomes a step function as the hill coefficient n ? ?.% R - anonymous function describing regulation of P production% - R must take the inputs R(gC, fC, A), in that order even if% parameters - vector of parameters for mass action reactions% sR - RNA being sensed e.g.These modelling techniques are explained in more detail later on.We came to realise that the reaction scheme above is not an accurate representation of what could actually happen in our system.We then inserted the relevant binding constants and generated plots to see how the species prevalent in our system varied.The Warwick iGEM team decided that it would be useful to test the model first by running it using completely idealised parameters.There is a more delayed decline in the molecule number of the RNA Binding Protein (B) as the \u0091fR\u0092 complex needs to be formed first.The numerator represents all the states of our system where the gene is activated while the denominator represents all of the possible states that our system could be in (with their corresponding reaction constants).Also, due to the nature of the GFP that we were using, we had to take into account degradation of GFP due to the degradation tag and diffusion.Hence, it was clear that we needed to produce an improved reaction scheme.This is significant because the association/dissociation constants for the different potential formation processes mean that the concentrations of the different species may be slightly different.So we then decided to construct another reaction scheme that showed in greater detail what was going on when our system detects Leptospirosis.These values are displayed in the parameters table.Figures 1, 2 and 3 are illustrations of our model, showing how the different species in our system will fluctuate in molecule number over time.% B - RNA binding protein which activates transcription when targeted to% A - fR::eC::B complex - the complete activator which up regulatesdsRdt = - af.*sR.This complex can bind DNA (implications in promoter % regulation) but does not recruit RNA binding protein% fC - fR::eC complex - guide RNA in the presence of sR bound to Cas9% complex.We achieved this by using our final reaction scheme for the Leptospirosis sensing system and altering the appropriate species in the reaction scheme.The number of Leptospirosis (sR), sgRNA (gR) an dCas9 (eC) molecules start off with relatively high values, but quickly decline as they all bind together to form the \u0091fR\u0092 complex, hence why the number of \u0091fR\u0092 molecules start at zero then slowly increases.1) Established a general idea of how our system works (Metal Aptamer sensor and Leptospirosis detector).2) Constructed useful reaction schemes to represent how our system works.3) Derived differential equations from reaction scheme using mathematical laws.4) Estimated reaction constants by reading through related literature and using acquired information to make reasonable estimations.5) Implemented differential equations with related reaction constants into MATLAB as functions.6) Produced graphical representations showing fluctuations in molecule number of each species.7) Devised potential experiments that could be conducted to characterise/parameterise model more accurately.The Warwick iGEM team decided to use a CRISPR/Cas9 system to build a sensing device for Leptospirosis detection.CRISPR technology is a relatively new, not fully understood technology, so for our project to be successful, it was imperative that we have as detailed an understanding of the way the technology operates as possible.Once these plasmids had been constructed, the sensing process could begin.At the start of the sensing process, when our system is in any environment, Plasmid 1 produces the dCas9.associated with Leptospirosis% gR - the guide RNA in the absence of the sR - this is a proxy specifies% representing the transcribed gRNA in its unfolded or partially folded% gC - gR::eC complex - guide RNA in the absence of the sR bound to the % Cas9 complex.Before our system could start sensing Leptospirosis RNA, we had to produce the three plasmids that in turn produced the sensing complex.In addition to causing confusion, this reaction was flawed because it doesn\u0092t show the production of GFP, but only the production of the complex that produces GFP.Fabricating this model also allowed us to have a base to compare the models with more realistic parameters to.In this idealised model, the reaction constants relevant to each of the equations that modelled the rate of change of molecule number of each of the species, in a single cell, were chosen to give us the most desirable output.In this case we picked our initial condition so that they were consistent with values that had already been obtained in from other experiments.The following examples are general Hill function equations:Key: n = hill coefficient, KA = Ligand concentration when half of binding sites are occupied by ligands, [L] = unbound ligand concentration, ? = Fraction of ligand binding sites on receiving molecule already occupied by ligands.Equation 1 shows the form of the Hill function used when trying to model activation while equation 2 shows the form of the Hill function used for deactivation of genes.As the system essentially works in the same way as our Leptospirosis system, the ODEs derived for our metal aptamer system were identical.Plasmid 2 produces the RNA binding protein with the attached Effector while Plasmid 3 makes the sgRNA.All of these products are released into the surrounding environment in large quantities.Our sgRNA design incorporates a region that is complementary to dCas9 molecules that we call the dCas9 handle.Another advantage of using this reaction scheme is that it showed the reversibility in all of the steps.With reformed, the dCas9 molecule will not be obstructed from binding to the dCas9 handle on the sgRNA.It describes the percentage of a molecule already bound by ligand as a function of the ligand concentration.The aim of applying these modelling techniques to our reaction was to derive ordinary differential equations that would dynamically represent the behaviour of our system over a given period of time.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "Bunsen required for all steps.1.Label tube with the name of the plasmid being

concern we had was that if we were to test the concentration of Leptospira in the blood that would trigger the diagnosis device, how would we do it without coming in to contact with either Leptospira bacteria, or human blood?Leptospira,the bacteria, we are detecting is a risk group 3 organism and is banned from use in iGEM.We incorporated safety considerations into the design and planning, and maintained excellent lab safety, at every stage of our project.As our device is meant to be used as a diagnosis tool, we considered what safety precautions would have to be taken given that we reach a stage where our device can be tested under real life conditions.This avoids having to specifically grow up Leptospira bacteria in our lab, or having to transform another bacteria with a plasmid encoding for Leptospira specific RNA.Our device tests for the presence of RNA from the spirochete Leptospira in the blood.We decided that if we were modifying the RNA in such a way, it would be simpler and less risky to use an entirely synthetic RNA sequence as the trigger for the device instead.In training labs in university, when students are taught how to screen blood they are encouraged to use their own, however we were hesitant to do this as individual variations in our blood could potentially alter the mechanics of the device, as well as the further ethical implications of testing a diagnosis device on previously untested human blood.We decided that instead of designing our device to test directly for Leptospira RNA we would initially design it to test for an analogue RNA thatdoes not code for any specific protein.Our first consideration was the bacteria that our device would be built inside.We decided that we would order in pre-screened human blood serum that we personally inoculate with modified bacteria carrying the trigger RNA gene.Leptospirosis is a contagious disease, and as such we wanted to find alternatives to having to test blood containing the bacteria directly in order to characterise our device.", "keywords": "phenylalanine degradation bioprinting infectious biomarkers paper-based nucleotides achievements temperatures description",

Different stationary phase temperature: by reducing the temperature we might be able to reduce growth and obtain more Curdlan  Yeast cell walls are naturally made up of various layers which are represented in the following diagram.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 68: 163\u0096173  [2] R. Zhang and K. J. Edgar (2014) Properties, Chemistry, and Applications of the Bioactive Polysaccharide Curdlan.Curdlan belongs to the class of biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses.Plos one 93:525\u0096531 To sum it up, we would like to produce Curdlan in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then sulfate it before spraying it on grapevine leaves as a preventive treatment against Downy mildew infections.Therefore, the only alkali soluble components are a mix of (1?6)-?-glucans(1?3)-?-D-glucans.We therefore decided to over-express the Curdlan metabolic pathway by inserting into yeast (INVSC1 strain ) an inducible promoter (Gal1) for the ?-glucan synthase gene (Fks1) hoping that this would allow the cell to produce Curdlan in greater quantities.Annu Rev Immunol 20:197\u0096216 [13] Jagodzinski PP, Wiaderkiewicz R (1994) Mechanism of the inhibitory effect of curdlan sulphate on HIV-1 infection in vitro.We rapidly eliminated Bacillus subtilis from our possible hosts due to its lack of enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of (1?3)-?-glucans (Figure 5).In addition, curdlan gels have medical and pharmacological potential, for example in drug delivery through sustained and diffusion-controlled release of the active ingredient.The protective effects for the bacteria are due to the fact that Curdlan forms a capsule that completely surrounds the outer cell surface of bacteria.(aimanianda et al 2009) In order to separate the two compounds, we plan on using (1?6)-?-glucanases in order to obtain a solution of (1?3)-?-glucans and therefore our Curdlan molecule.All the other Curdlan clinical applications in cancer, diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia etc.\u00bb  \u00ab Because, as we explained on the problem page, Downy Mildew is a real problem for the Aquitaine region.This is demonstrated by the study of a double mutant of pmr4 which restore the susceptibility to mildew.Glucan molecules are polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers linked by glycosidic bonds and one of them is called Curdlan , a (1?3)-?-D-glucan.Also, activation of a Pathogenesis-Related protein called PR1 in grapevine is regulated by the salicylic acid signaling pathway .[16] To conclude, activation of natural defenses before the invasion of pathogens is a way to improve the plant resistance against infection and to reduce the use of chemicals products.Figure 2: Schematic representation of the (1?3)-?-glucan synthetic pathway [2]  Before starting the project, we took a few weeks to decide which host organism we would use and how they could be useful.We planned on amplifying our fragments by PCR and creating different biobricks with different assemblies of our genes and plasmids in order to find the effect of each gene on Curdlan production and to verify the efficiency of our promoter.The safety of Curdlan has been assessed in animal studies and in vitro tests [4,5] and it is approved for food use in Korea, Taiwan and Japan as an inert dietary fibre.Furthermore, non-sulfated Curdlan doesn t trigger the response through a mutant gene: pmr4.[10] Furthermore, Curdlan derivatives are members of a class of compounds known as biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses.This is the medium which is used for Curdlan production in Agrobacterium and is also interesting since it is a minimal medium which allows us to easily vary parameters and optimize production.Gal1 promoter and HIS3 was extract by PCR from pFA 6a-HIS3MX6-pGAL-3HA .On the other hand, we will integrate the FKS1 gene into the iGEM plasmid pSB1C3 to get our BioBrick that we ll send to Boston.However, we found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae naturally produces Curdlan in its cell wall, like Agrobacterium.This is not the case with E. coli in our project.First, we decided to produce Curdlan with Escherichia coli , because Agrobacterium tumefasciens because both of them are Gram negative bacteria and have a lot of membrane similarity.We therefore inserted the three genes which code for the ?-glucan synthase and metabolic transporters in Agrobacterium (crdASC) into E. coli .In: WHO (ed) 53rd Meeting of the joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives.For example, it can have antitumor, anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities (see other properties of Curdlan).Commonly, the yeast cell wall is made of 5-10% of (1?6)-?-glucans and 50-55% of a mix of (1?3)-?-glucans and (1?3)-?-glucans.So, sulfation of the glucan would counteract the negative feedback effect.In Agrobacterium , three genes (crdA, crdS and crdC) are required for Curdlan production.However, more research is needed for the further development of these useful properties, in particular by reducing the cost of production.CRC, Boca Raton, pp 269\u0096286 [5] Spicer EJF, Goldenthal EI, Ikeda T (1999) A toxicological assessment of curdlan.In order to have control over the different culture perameters we also decided to use M63 culture medium.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 68: 163\u0096173  [2] M. McIntosh (2012) Recent advances in curdlan biosynthesis, biotechnological production, and applications.[1] M. McIntosh (2005) Curdlan and other bacterial (1?3)-?-D-glucans mini review.The capsule formation is correlated with cell aggregation (floc formation) and it is suggested that the capsule and floc formation together function as protective structures in cases of Nitrogen-starvation of the post-stationary phase.We then tried to put a inductive promoter ahead of the relevant gene by homologous recombination.[1]  [1] M. McIntosh (2005) Curdlan and other bacterial (1?3)-?-D-glucans mini review.Indeed, Curdlan production in Agrobacterium requires Nitrogen Starvation and its growth parameters need to be relatively precise.All three genes were synthesized by IDT separately with the correct ends to allow integration in the iGEM plasmids and an easy creation of our biobricks.Since the layer of mannan and proteins as well as chitin is insoluble in alkali solutions, beta glucans are easily separated from the rest of the yeast cell wall.Trends Glycosci Glycotechnol 4:309\u0096317 [10] Kanke M, Tanabe E,(1995) Application of curdlan to controlled drug delivery.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 93:525\u0096531  [3] Adrien Gauthier (2014)The Sulfated Laminarin Triggers a Stress Transcriptome before Priming the SA- and ROS-Dependent Defenses during Grapevine\u0092s Induced Resistance against Plasmopara viticola.However, site-directed mutagenesis may be necessary when integrating the gene into the plasmid because there are restriction sites (EcoR1) that are unwanted within the HIS3 gene.The results indicate that the chemical modification of an elicitor, such as sulfated derivative of \u00df-glucans, could improve its resistance-inducer efficiency.However, since our gene sequences for crdA, crdS, and crdC originally come from Agrobacterium we decided to optimize our gene codons for E. coli with IDT codon optimization tool in order to make sure that our gene would correctly be expressed.konjac glucomannan, methylcellulose), the heating process alone produces different forms of curdlan gels with different textural qualities, physical stabilities and water-holding capacities.Manipulation of the conditions for self-assembly may allow the engineering of new materials.", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "", "notebook": "In our Notebook we provide a summary of our labwork and an overview over the used protocols.", "protocol": "", "result": "The primers used for PCR have floating tails allowing the integration of the cassette upstream FKS1 gene.Thanks to Derek Mc Cluster we tried to overexpress FKS1 gene by integrating GAL1 inducible promoter upstream of it by the homologous recombination method.The amplification product containing the selection gene and the promoter flanked by the homologous recombination of sequences is purified.For that, we designed PCR primers that flank the gene of interest taking into account the issues of specific primers to the target sequences, self-aliasing or primer annealing there between.To insert FKS1 gene into the chosen plasmid, it was necessary to amplify this gene by PCR on yeast genomic DNA.One of the first strategies to overexpress the FKS1 gene encoding a D-glucan synthase was to insert it into a plasmid compatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We designed a pair of primers specifically hybridizing upstream of the gene of interest and framing the location where construction must integrate.?

iGEM team to test the toxicity of this molecule on the bacteria that already live in nature.For the Environment Even if copper is essential for life at low doses, it is environmentally toxic at higher doses.Also, the copper-related risks are increased if added residues of this product from agricultural cultures, other food sources containing copper as tap water.This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer s disease.This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer s disease.For Humans Through the food chain, copper is an essential element for life at low doses.Indeed, when it is accumulated in the body in large quantities, it is supposed to affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain.If we want to directly use our synthetic organism on the plant, we must integrate death genes in their genomes to create organisms that are not be able to live in natural conditions.In our project, the cell can\u0092t evolve and in any manner alter the environment.After different doses were tested, an encouraging result emerged : the weekly fructose application of 100 g / ha had a similar effect than a treatment of 600 g / ha of copper.Indeed, when it accumulates in the body, it is in too large quantities, it would affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain.In 2013, the \u0093Savoy ADAbio\u0094 tested on vine plants the effect of very low doses of different sugars in order to replace the copper treatment in the fight against pests.This element has been used many times to treat mildew which has resulted in it\u0092s accumulation in the Aquitaine region.In the case of our project, we are not planning on directly applying our genetically engineered bacteria on the plant but only our purified molecule.The measure reduces the damage to the biosphere but isn\u0092t sufficient: copper sulfate is tolerated but not banished.This molecule already exists in nature, it is naturally present in the yeast\u0092s wall.Compared to copper sulfate which is a toxic compound, this molecule seems to be more environmentally friendly.In other words, we chose to spray on the vine only the cell product: Curdlan.We are not using the entire cell Another important theme is the spread of new organisms in nature.However, it is harmful if swallowed or inhaled, in cases of skin contact, eye contact (hence the compulsory wearing of gloves masks and glasses during our project) and is very toxic to aquatic organisms.In the lab, there is a specific solvent cabinet for liquid wastes.No bad impact on the environment has been identified.For now, we are still waiting for the results.The team who worked in the lab received instructions of lab safety with safety training.Most products used are classified

and systems biology.Most recently I have worked on the redesign of naturally occurring enzymes for the degradation of immunogenic gluten proteins, to develop a novel CO2 fixation pathways, and design of a novel anthrax therapeutic.My name is Muntaha Samad and I am a third year at UC Davis studying Computer Science and Engineering.I decided to join iGEM, because I was interested in the engineering approach and view iGEM has towards biology.I contributed to the project mostly through outreach and wastewater collection.I have been an advisor to UC Davis iGEM teams for the past 5 years and have enjoyed every minute of it.I also assisted with hardware and hardware testing.University of California Davis, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and School of Medicine  My scientific efforts are focused on combining computational and experimental tools to develop a fundamental knowledge of enzyme catalysis, and applying those principles to design novel proteins of therapeutic or

of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan\u0092s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303.It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water\u0085Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samplesContinue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds\u0085 or 1 60-fold)Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallelWhen we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan.In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!Triclosan\u0092s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH.Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan.Cognizant of these two points, we developed an \u0093antimicrobial awareness app\u0094 to extend our solution more broadly.In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels).Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi!IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI.*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme.We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition dataTriclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3].Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28].As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI.We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water.However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and functionScience Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationshipsLearning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and functionIn regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:Providing a teacher\u0092s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.These include a teacher s guide, classroom powerpoint, and assessment questions -- all of which can be downloaded below: Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting.The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally: be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae).\"Kinetic and Structural Characteristics of the Inhibition of Enoyl (acyl Carrier Protein) Reductase by Triclosan.\"In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn\u0092t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our projectOf the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18].From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI\u0092s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19].Nature 485(7397): 185-194.Rodricks, Joseph V. \"Triclosan: A Critical Review of the Experimental Data and Development of

synthesis.Notwithstanding, NADPH is significantly more expensive than NADH[24], so instead of accommodating for S. aureus FabI, we decided to remove it from the FabI team.We were down to the \"Fab 5\".An alternative substrate was thus necessary for our biosensor to be used in a practical setting.To achieve our goal of developing a cost effective triclosan biosensor then, we were tasked with (a) discovering an enzyme that met all of our criteria and (b) identifying an alternative substrate that would enable practical use.(2001) 48 (1): 1-6. doi: 10.1093/jac/48.1.1[12] Mechanism and Inhibition

a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.The second obstacle Ms. Moriarty mentioned are the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum.pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA.(2000) \u0091Inhibition of InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by triclosan and isoniazid\u0092,Biochemistry, Vol.We realized early on that if we wanted to promote responsible chemical use, we had to go about the issue responsibly ourselves.We found all living organisms except for the Archaea, who synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it\u0092s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI\u0092s from different organisms[5].\"Structural basis for the variation in triclosan affinity to enoyl reductases.\"The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA\u0092s role as an acyl carrier.Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are \u0093good\u0094 or \u0093poor\u0094 distractors, answer choices designed to test common misconceptions, and common statistics like the \u0093facility factor\u0094 and \u0093discrimination factor\u0094 that test how easy or hard a particular question is and how well a question help to discriminate different skill levels in a class, respectively.1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry (Bba_K771303), 3 FabI proteins taken from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae.To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution.We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum.We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae.[11] Courtney Slater-Radosti, Glenn Van Aller, Rebecca Greenwood, Richard Nicholas, Paul M. Keller, Walter E. DeWolf, Jr, Frank Fan, David J. Payne, and Deborah D. Jaworski Biochemical and genetic characterization of the action of triclosan on Staphylococcus aureus J. Antimicrob.This meant making a concerted effort to understand the complexities of the issue, learning from the past and present in developing a viable solution for the future, and assessing the implications of our proposed solution.After identifying public awareness as an effective catalyst for change, we researched civic engagement initiatives and identified that successful civic engagement measures fostered a sense of individual and collective responsibility and provided a sense of agency that s grounded in reality.Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.Mechanism and inhibition of the FabI enoyl-ACP reductase from Burkholderia pseudomallei.\"Common themes in redox chemistry emerge from the X-ray structure of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase.\"Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay.\"Enoyl-ACP Reductase (FabI) of Haemophilus influenzae: Steady-State Kinetic Mechanism and Inhibition by Triclosan and Hexachlorophene.\"Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al.(See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex.Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.In explaining the first iteration of the lesson plan, which involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement, Ms. Moriarty raised some valid concerns.\"Slow-tight-binding Inhibition of Enoyl-acyl Carrier Protein Reductase from Plasmodium Falciparum by Triclosan.\"Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices.Pagliarulo talked about how designing an educational activity is a process by which you identify objectives and criteria for success, come up with a prototype, test it, evaluate it based on criteria, and iteratively refine it.What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.We didn\u0092t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle.We later found out we didn\u0092t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent!This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g.aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12].As a result, we identified high school students as a potential audience and a lesson plan as a viable medium for promoting responsible chemical use.(May 2009)[6] RJ, Heath, Rubin JR, Holland DR, Zhang E, Snow ME, and Rock CO. \"Mechanism of Triclosan Inhibition of Bacterial Fatty Acid Synthesis.\"Validation of the survey instrument would require us to assess statistics known as \u0093validity\u0094 and \u0093reliability\u0094 [REF #.3].A good educational plan has a plan for assessing the quality of the assessments too.Dr.[18]In addition, the commercially available native substrate for FabI (crotonyl-CoA) is unstable and costly.Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, \u0093antimicrobial footprint app,\u0094 to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20].10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00284.x [19] Eriksson M, Johansson H, Fihlman V, Grehn A, Sanli K, Andersson MX, Blanck H, Arrhenius \u00c5, Sircar T, Backhaus T. (2014) Long-term effects of the antibacterial agent triclosan on marine periphyton communities.We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day.Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, we connected with CRS\u0092 network of teachers in our area -- just a portion of their network of 1,400 teachers.[21]In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run.Moriarty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being constraints imposed by lack of funding and needing to teach to a curriculum.In regards to budget constraints Mr. Moriarty talked about the difficulty in planning field trips due to lack of funding.We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme\u0092s activity on trans-2-pentenal.We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM.The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme\u0092s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme\u0092s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/B.One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction.To screen a representative subset of FabI\u0092s from all available domains of life, we mined the literature and found every characterized FabI with published inhibition data.Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan.To instill a sense of agency, we wanted to engage students in a hands on activity; however, current methods of detection are not well suited for a classroom environment.Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10].However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay: and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.This need motivated our wetlab effort in developing a reliable and cost effective triclosan biosensor that could be used in conjunction with our lesson plan to raise awareness and accountability around triclosan use.We then took a step back to assess the possible implications of our lesson plan.It was unclear however which of the thousands of FabI enzymes we should use for our biosensor since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a FabI gene.While we are excited to share our lesson with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope.A. Koenig, A. S. Beatty, Developing assessments for the next generation science standards (National Academies Press, 2014).Ref #.2 Russell, J.Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set.These require different assessment instruments.assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we\u0092re interested in assessing but rather the student\u0092s ability to decipher the questions.[22] Vick JE, Clomburg JM, Blankschien MD, Chou A, Kim S, Gonzalez R.Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) supports efficient operation of a functional reversal of ?-oxidation cycle.[18])We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI.\"Triclosan causes toxic effects to algae in marine biofilms, but does not inhibit the metabolic activity of marine biofilm bacteria.\"\"Antimicrobial Spectrum of Triclosan, a Broad-spectrum Antimicrobial Agent for Topical Application.Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use.We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens.He gave us some insight:crafting \u0093layered\u0094 questions that assess different levels on Bloom\u0092s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom\u0092s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom\u0092s questions might test a student\u0092s ability to apply the core lessons to new situationsdifferent objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.We couldn\u0092t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA.In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.Ms.To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout.We harkened back to Bruce Hammock\u0092s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum\u0092s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another.Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a \u0093pre post test\u0094.What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost.We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part.Percent inhibition was calculated by:The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme.Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute.Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents.100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADHWe are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen.To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid.This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.Dr.\"Triclosan Offers Protection against Blood Stages of Malaria by Inhibiting Enoyl-ACP Reductase of Plasmodium Falciparum.\"We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry!Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment?Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale.The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory.(2008) A pathogenic fungi diphenyl ether phytotoxin targets plant enoyl (acyl carrier protein) reductase.Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students.And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.We decided to use our device\u0092s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion.[32] Bornscheuer, U. T., G. W. Huisman, R. J. Kazlauskas, S. Lutz, J. C. Moore and K. Robins (2012).We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond.Human practice issues motivated our project and have informed its design every step of the way.This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences.To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.Ms.[28] Perozzo, R., M.

a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan\u0092s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303.It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water\u0085Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samplesContinue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds\u0085 or 1 60-fold)Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallelWhen we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan.In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!Triclosan\u0092s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH.Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan.Cognizant of these two points, we developed an \u0093antimicrobial awareness app\u0094 to extend our solution more broadly.In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels).Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi!IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI.*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme.We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition dataTriclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3].Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28].As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI.We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water.However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and functionScience Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationshipsLearning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and functionIn regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:Providing a teacher\u0092s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.These include a teacher s guide, classroom powerpoint, and assessment questions -- all of which can be downloaded below: Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting.The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally: be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae).\"Kinetic and Structural Characteristics of the Inhibition of Enoyl (acyl Carrier Protein) Reductase by Triclosan.\"In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn\u0092t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our projectOf the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18].From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI\u0092s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19].Nature 485(7397): 185-194.Rodricks, Joseph V. \"Triclosan: A Critical Review of the Experimental Data and Development of Margins of Safety for Consumer Products.\"This is why we needed to screen a panel of enzymes in order to find the enzyme most sensitive towards triclosan with a nanomolar inhibition constant.Characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosaenoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI): a target for the antimicrobial triclosan and its role in acylated homoserine lactone synthesis.Notwithstanding, NADPH is significantly more expensive than NADH[24], so instead of accommodating for S. aureus FabI, we decided to remove it from the FabI team.We were down to the \"Fab 5\".An alternative substrate was thus necessary for our biosensor to be used in a practical setting.To achieve our goal of developing a cost effective triclosan biosensor then, we were tasked with (a) discovering an enzyme that met all of our criteria and (b) identifying an alternative substrate that would enable practical use.(2001) 48 (1): 1-6. doi: 10.1093/jac/48.1.1[12] Mechanism and Inhibition

a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.The second obstacle Ms. Moriarty mentioned are the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum.pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA.(2000) \u0091Inhibition of InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by triclosan and isoniazid\u0092,Biochemistry, Vol.We realized early on that if we wanted to promote responsible chemical use, we had to go about the issue responsibly ourselves.We found all living organisms except for the Archaea, who synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it\u0092s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI\u0092s from different organisms[5].\"Structural basis for the variation in triclosan affinity to enoyl reductases.\"The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA\u0092s role as an acyl carrier.Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are \u0093good\u0094 or \u0093poor\u0094 distractors, answer choices designed to test common misconceptions, and common statistics like the \u0093facility factor\u0094 and \u0093discrimination factor\u0094 that test how easy or hard a particular question is and how well a question help to discriminate different skill levels in a class, respectively.1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry (Bba_K771303), 3 FabI proteins taken from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae.To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution.We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum.We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae.[11] Courtney Slater-Radosti, Glenn Van Aller, Rebecca Greenwood, Richard Nicholas, Paul M. Keller, Walter E. DeWolf, Jr, Frank Fan, David J. Payne, and Deborah D. Jaworski Biochemical and genetic characterization of the action of triclosan on Staphylococcus aureus J. Antimicrob.This meant making a concerted effort to understand the complexities of the issue, learning from the past and present in developing a viable solution for the future, and assessing the implications of our proposed solution.After identifying public awareness as an effective catalyst for change, we researched civic engagement initiatives and identified that successful civic engagement measures fostered a sense of individual and collective responsibility and provided a sense of agency that s grounded in reality.Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.Mechanism and inhibition of the FabI enoyl-ACP reductase from Burkholderia pseudomallei.\"Common themes in redox chemistry emerge from the X-ray structure of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase.\"Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay.\"Enoyl-ACP Reductase (FabI) of Haemophilus influenzae: Steady-State Kinetic Mechanism and Inhibition by Triclosan and Hexachlorophene.\"Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al.(See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex.Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.In explaining the first iteration of the lesson plan, which involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement, Ms. Moriarty raised some valid concerns.\"Slow-tight-binding Inhibition of Enoyl-acyl Carrier Protein Reductase from Plasmodium Falciparum by Triclosan.\"Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices.Pagliarulo talked about how designing an educational activity is a process by which you identify objectives and criteria for success, come up with a prototype, test it, evaluate it based on criteria, and iteratively refine it.What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.We didn\u0092t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle.We later found out we didn\u0092t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent!This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g.aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12].As a result, we identified high school students as a potential audience and a lesson plan as a viable medium for promoting responsible chemical use.(May 2009)[6] RJ, Heath, Rubin JR, Holland DR, Zhang E, Snow ME, and Rock CO. \"Mechanism of Triclosan Inhibition of Bacterial Fatty Acid Synthesis.\"Validation of the survey instrument would require us to assess statistics known as \u0093validity\u0094 and \u0093reliability\u0094 [REF #.3].A good educational plan has a plan for assessing the quality of the assessments too.Dr.[18]In addition, the commercially available native substrate for FabI (crotonyl-CoA) is unstable and costly.Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, \u0093antimicrobial footprint app,\u0094 to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20].10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00284.x [19] Eriksson M, Johansson H, Fihlman V, Grehn A, Sanli K, Andersson MX, Blanck H, Arrhenius \u00c5, Sircar T, Backhaus T. (2014) Long-term effects of the antibacterial agent triclosan on marine periphyton communities.We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day.Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, we connected with CRS\u0092 network of teachers in our area -- just a portion of their network of 1,400 teachers.[21]In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run.Moriarty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being constraints imposed by lack of funding and needing to teach to a curriculum.In regards to budget constraints Mr. Moriarty talked about the difficulty in planning field trips due to lack of funding.We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme\u0092s activity on trans-2-pentenal.We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM.The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme\u0092s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme\u0092s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/B.One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction.To screen a representative subset of FabI\u0092s from all available domains of life, we mined the literature and found every characterized FabI with published inhibition data.Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan.To instill a sense of agency, we wanted to engage students in a hands on activity; however, current methods of detection are not well suited for a classroom environment.Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10].However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay: and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.This need motivated our wetlab effort in developing a reliable and cost effective triclosan biosensor that could be used in conjunction with our lesson plan to raise awareness and accountability around triclosan use.We then took a step back to assess the possible implications of our lesson plan.It was unclear however which of the thousands of FabI enzymes we should use for our biosensor since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a FabI gene.While we are excited to share our lesson with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope.A. Koenig, A. S. Beatty, Developing assessments for the next generation science standards (National Academies Press, 2014).Ref #.2 Russell, J.Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set.These require different assessment instruments.assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we\u0092re interested in assessing but rather the student\u0092s ability to decipher the questions.[22] Vick JE, Clomburg JM, Blankschien MD, Chou A, Kim S, Gonzalez R.Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) supports efficient operation of a functional reversal of ?-oxidation cycle.[18])We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI.\"Triclosan causes toxic effects to algae in marine biofilms, but does not inhibit the metabolic activity of marine biofilm bacteria.\"\"Antimicrobial Spectrum of Triclosan, a Broad-spectrum Antimicrobial Agent for Topical Application.Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use.We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens.He gave us some insight:crafting \u0093layered\u0094 questions that assess different levels on Bloom\u0092s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom\u0092s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom\u0092s questions might test a student\u0092s ability to apply the core lessons to new situationsdifferent objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.We couldn\u0092t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA.In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.Ms.To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout.We harkened back to Bruce Hammock\u0092s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum\u0092s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another.Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a \u0093pre post test\u0094.What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost.We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part.Percent inhibition was calculated by:The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme.Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute.Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents.100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADHWe are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen.To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid.This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.Dr.\"Triclosan Offers Protection against Blood Stages of Malaria by Inhibiting Enoyl-ACP Reductase of Plasmodium Falciparum.\"We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry!Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment?Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale.The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory.(2008) A pathogenic fungi diphenyl ether phytotoxin targets plant enoyl (acyl carrier protein) reductase.Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students.And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.We decided to use our device\u0092s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion.[32] Bornscheuer, U. T., G. W. Huisman, R. J. Kazlauskas, S. Lutz, J. C. Moore and K. Robins (2012).We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond.Human practice issues motivated our project and have informed its design every step of the way.This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences.To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.Ms.[28] Perozzo, R., M.

Sakaiensis originated at a recycling plant, we thought to contact labs that have discovered bacteria in wastewater treatment facilities.Because Seabin is still in development, we brainstormed possible future integrations of our sensor device with their platform.This encouraged us to try thinking of locations where we could find bacteria capable of metabolizing terephthalic acid.Thus, the energy produced by our MFC will help send a signal back to researchers to indicate the location of plastic in the ocean.We had up to this point wanted to use the electricity generated by our MFC to power a floating device like the Seabin.And, while the Seabin may be too large to suck in microplastics, our system would actually work better with microplastic because they are easier to break down.", "modeling": "Using the paper as a blueprint, our team constructed a model in Matlab (code available at the bottom of this page) that enables its users to enter values for adsorption, desorption, and catalysis constants and values for initial substrate and enzyme concentrations to immediately receive values for the Michaelis-Menten constant and the percentage of substrate that is bound to the enzyme at any point in time.The paper, \"Calculation of Protein Extinction Coefficients from Amino Acid Sequence Data\",5 guided us through the process of finding this crucial coefficient for a wavelength of 280 nm and allowed us to use the number of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine amino acids present in PETase to arrive at an extinction coefficient of 39170 M-1 cm-1.As our team and mentors investigated more sophisticated variations of Michaelis-Menten, we uncovered a highly relevant paper, \"Surface Enzyme Kinetics for Biopolymer Microarrays: a Combination of Langmuir and Michaelis-Menten Concepts\"4.Since our assessment of enzyme kinetics was purely comparative (that is, we judged the efficiency of surface kinetics by comparing them to kinetics in solution), we focused our investigation on the parameters that are unique to surfaces: adsorption and desorption.Supporting Future Experiments: Calculating Extinction CoefficientsDuring our wet lab work with PETase this summer, we managed to successfully isolate the enzyme.To understand conditions involving small pieces of plastic, our team relied on Michaelis-Menten, a widely-applied model for enzyme kinetics.Although we have the necessary tools to measure the optical density (OD) of a solution that contains PETase, OD measurements are not sufficient on their own to determine concentration because we do not know how much light the enzyme absorbs.This is where modelling comes into the picture.\"Surface Enzyme Kinetics for Biopolymer Microarrays: A Combination of Langmuir and Michaelis-Menten Concepts.\"Though PETase is the most efficient PET-degrading enzyme discovered to date,1 it by no means degrades plastic instantaneously.Below is the equation from the paper that enabled us to determine the extinction coefficient: Although this technically the coefficient for the denatured protein, the paper states explicitly that there is a \"relatively small difference\" between this coefficient and the coefficient of the native protein at 280 nm.However, we soon realized that the Michaelis-Menten model, with its references to substrate concentration, assumes that the substrate is in solution and would therefore be unsuitable for describing the kinetics associated with large solid substrates.An overview of Michaelis-Menten:3 The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) corresponds to the substrate concentration at which the speed of the reaction is half of the maximum possible velocity: Our team initially intended to compare the Michaelis-Menten constant associated with small plastics suspended in solutions to that of large pieces of plastics.It is valid at the beginning of reactions and is especially compatible with our reactor design considering that the products of the reaction are funneled to another chamber where none of the original substrate or enzyme are present.In future quantitative experiments involving PETase, it would be useful to have a means by which we could calculate the concentration of this enzyme in a given solution.In order to calculate the concentration of enzyme present, our team also needs to know PETase s extinction coefficient.The task required us to understand enzyme kinetics under two broad sets of circumstances: When the pieces of plastic were small enough in size so that they were effectively suspended in a solution.Another assumption is that the enzyme must be either free or bound to the substrate.Informing our Design: Modelling Michaelis-Menten KineticsAs we were refining the design of our plastic-sensing device, we were having a difficult time accounting for the lag between plastic uptake and plastic degradation.Prior to beginning our work, we ensured that the assumptions inherent in the model were reasonable for modelling PETase activity:2The model assumes that the product is not converted back into the substrate.The assumption also makes sense considering that our enzyme functions by breaking down polymers: after the reaction, the newly formed monomers no longer fit in the enzyme s active site.This would require us to apply models geared towards heterogeneous reactions that involve interactions between a solid substrate and an enzyme in solution.The extinction coefficient of an enzyme describes how much light the enzyme absorbs at a given wavelength.We realized that understanding degradation rates as determined by enzyme kinetics would allow us to adjust our reactor design to minimize the lag in signal.It states that it is reasonably accurate to calculate it \"directly... from amino acid

"protocol": "", "result": "Further, this is evidence that the induction system we designed has strong control over PETase-sfGFP expression because we see almost no absorbance when the cultures were

catalytic PETase and have optimized pH for our engineered E. coli, we want to be able to produce a signal in the presence of our PET degradation byproduct, terephthalic acid (TPA).Plastiback can be easy to use with a fluorescent \u0093systems check\u0094 and also break down PET.Now that we have the PETase enzyme working, we want to optimize the pH to have the most enzyme activity and fastest growth rate of E. coli.Because our recombinant PETase protein is the only his-tagged protein in the cell, we would expect to see a signal only from the band which contains PETase.This demonstrates that D. tsuruhatensis and the exogenous mediator are successfully working together in the microbial fuel to produce electricity from terephthalic acid, and that we are able to read out a signal from the presence of terephthalic acid.Unexpectedly, we also see a PETase-sized band in lanes 2,3, and 4, which should only have a band at 70 kD for the PETase-sfGFP fusion.In the visualization experiment, we can also test whether our inducible system is working because we would expect uninduced cells not to fluoresce, or at least fluoresce at a low basal level.They also confirm that we have inducible control over our construct because the uninduced sample shows basal expression.Delftia tsuruhatensis TPA utilizes TPA as the sole carbon sourceSelecting Exogenous Mediator Type and ConcentrationBefore we could test our MFC with D. tsuruhatensis and TPA, we had to determine which exogenous mediator would be optimal for our MFC.If you are wondering what the dark band below the PETase band is, it is

expression through SDS Page and Western blotValidated PETase enzymatic activity through pNPB substrate assayCharacterized growth of three bacteria species in TPA minimal mediaDemonstrated TPA signal can be detected by voltage increase in microbial fuel cellAfter constructing our system, we needed to prove that it functions the way we designed it to.Although we confirmed the presence of our protein with sfGFP visualization, an SDS Page will further confirm by showing that a protein of the correct weight is being expressed.Not willing to sacrifice this ease-of-use feature, we set out to show that PETase-sfGFP could still be catalytically active.We adapted an assay used by the UC Davis 2012 Team that could characterize PETase\u0092s esterase activity with a colorimetric readout.Additionally, we see a band at 70 kD in lanes 2 and 3, which is the expected size of PETase-sfGFP fusion.Yoshida et al (2016) A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate)As shown in the graph below, there is a big dropoff in growth between pH 8.5 and pH 9.0, therefore the happy medium between E. coli growth and PETase enzyme activity is around pH 8.5.In conclusion, this Western demonstrates that we have inducible control over PETase expression.After constructing our PETase-sfGFP fusion plasmids and demonstrating we had inducible control PETase expression via sfGFP visualization, SDS Page and Western Blot, we were ready to test whether the PETase-sfGFP construct catalytically active.At 30 kD, we see a band which corresponds to the approximate expected size of PETase (28.6 kD).After the voltage of D. tsuruhatensis in the presence of methylene blue and M9 plateaued, we injected terephthalic acid into the mix.From the original paper published on PETase1 we knew that the PETase could be catalytically active in our chassis organism E. coli, but we didn\u0092t know whether the upgrades we made to the system would interfere with the catalytic activity.To show that any change in absorption was due to PETase-sfGFP fluorescence rather than other artifacts of the cell lysate, an uninduced control was run with pNPB substrate.Cells were induced with 0.4M, 0.1M, or 0M IPTG for either 6 hours or overnight, at either 15 or 30 degrees C. After expression, cells were then lysed according to our ultrasonication protocol, and supernatant and pellet were collected for the SDS Page gel.While the SDS page can show a protein of the proper size is being expressed, a Western allows us to probe the identity of protein itself.Before performing the SDS Page we grew up T7 lysY Iq cells containing a plasmid with PETase under control of the T7 promoter.Our final step in showing that we can produce an electrical signal from TPA was to demonstrate a voltage surge in an actual microbial fuel cell using D. tsuruhatensis, methylene blue, and terephthalic acid.To this end, we reached out to Parley for the Oceans, an organization dedicated to tackling threats to our oceans.The background is absorbance is likely due to the sfGFP fusion, which typically emits most strongly at a different wavelength but would also absorb some at 405nm.Lysozyme was run as a control, which you can see has a dark band in the same location.Below are our results:Induced PETase-sfGFP fusion is catalytically active.PETase fused to GFP is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate over time.Cells were lysed, and triplicates of induced culture lysate were mixed with pNPB substrate or the same lysis buffer they were already in.Without inducer, otherwise identical cell lysate has low absorbance as it is not expressing PETase or the GFP tag (brown).This experiment again demonstrates our system\u0092s inducible control: the blue box shows there is no band in the absence of IPTG.Upon the addition of PNPB substrate, absorbance increases (pink trend) suggesting that PETase is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate.For the SDS Page protocol, please refer to our experiments page.Likewise, the substrate by itself has low absorbance (blue).Our results indicate that PETase-sfGFP has background absorbance without the pNPB substrate, but that with the pNPB substrate absorbance increases, showing that PETase-sfGFP is able to catalyze pNPB into 4-nitrophenol which will absorb at this wavelength.We put either methylene blue or neutral red into a plate reader with the E. Coli overnight to observe which condition would result in the largest reduction of methylene blue or neutral red.As shown in the graph below, D. tsuruhatensis with M9 (medium with no carbon source) didn\u0092t grow as well as D. tsuruhatensis with M9 and TPA.To control for the background absorption of pNPB, just the substrate was also run.To make PETase easily detectable via Western Blot, we designed our constructs to include a \u0093His tag\u0094 which is targeted by a commercially available antibody.We hypothesize this is because the PETase GFP fusion is being degraded by proteases because it is so large.PETase has a weight of 24 kDa, so the band is exactly where we would expect to see PETase.After contacting Parley, we were redirected to their Junior Project Manager, Lisa Gran, who sent us 10g of \u0093mixed raw plastic\u0094 from the organization\u0092s most recent beach cleanup.In the control that has not been induced (0M IPTG), we do not observe a band between 20 and 25 kDa.In our induced sample, we observed sfGFP fluorescence at a magnification of 100x.The image below shows that the best exogenous mediator type and concentration is methylene blue at 0.005.Delftia tsuruhatensis, Methylene Blue and TPA in Microbial Fuel Cell: Voltage over timeOur team achieved our objectives and successfully managed to demonstrate PETase enzymatic activity in a laboratory setting.Although you can still observe some baseline sfGFP fluorescence, the induced sample is much brighter and has many more cells fluorescing.It is also important that our inducible promoter is truly controlling protein expression and uninduced samples do not produce much PETase.The largest color change would indicate that the bacteria had efficiently reduced the exogenous mediator.We hypothesize the smear we see between 70 kD and 30kD in lane 2 is because of the same phenomenon, such that the PETase-GFP fusion is being chopped into varying length fragments, each which has a histag and therefore shows up on the blot.Future directions of our project would include characterizing degradation of the acquired mixed plastic to simulate a real-world situation and work towards optimizing our system.1Yoshida, Shosuke et al.In the future, our team envisions our enzyme degrading plastic collected directly from the ocean.This band is strongest in lane 1, which contains lysate from our PETase construct that is unfused to GFP and induced with IPTG.By simply shining a UV light on the cell culture, an ocean plastic researcher without synthetic biology experience can determine whether Plastiback is working or not based simply on fluorescence.For a more detailed description, please refer to the project experiments page.D.In particular, the sfGFP fusion we made to allow Plastiback to be easily serviced by ocean researchers might interfere with the enzyme\u0092s active site, for example.On the right is the uninduced sample, also at 100x.The assay, called the p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) substrate assay, demonstrates enzyme activity when the breaking of an ester bond in the substrate produces 4-Nitrophenol.The sfGFP tag produces some absorbance reading which is why the green trend line is not closer to zero.In order to produce an electrical signal from TPA in our MFC, we have to first demonstrate that our bacteria can metabolize TPA.Finally, we see no signal in lane 5, which was lysate from cells containing the same construct as lane 1, but uninduced.Because we wanted to test with a bacteria known to work with exogenous mediators, we ran this preliminary test with E. Coli.By running an SDS-PAGE as described above, we could separate all the proteins in the cell by size.Showing our protein is inducibly expressed: SDS Page and Western blotNext, we can validate protein expression further with SDS Page and Western blot visualization.Our graph below shows that after adding terephthalic acid, the voltage spikes from just below 90mV to around 120mV.The individual specks in the following photo on the left are cells.", "safety": "What opinions do these people have about your project?Our product is intended to be used as a plastic-mapping and plastic-degrading device for ocean researchers and others concerned with the distribution of plastic in the ocean.Future directions of our project are mechanical design solutions to the following important questions: How do we prevent small animals from getting trapped in the device?Will the device stay afloat and be easy to retrieve from the ocean?What happens when it s all used up?On a farm, in a factory, inside human bodies, in the ocean?Because our prototype is meant to be used in the ocean, we envision a bioreactor design that ensures the engineered microbes act as a closed system that is not released into the ocean environment.Lastly, because the Delftia bacteria in the microbial fuel cell is not genetically modified, its escape does not pose a significant risk.If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?Direct benefits of a successful and efficient plastic-sensing system, such as Plastiback, will be felt by researchers looking to map the distribution of plastics in the ocean, who have no alternative to physical sampling.At our current stage of research, we have determined that PETase production exerts a significant metabolic load on our expression cells, making them unlikely to be able to survive in the ocean environment.The influx of plastic will make that difficult, but future directions for research will include solidifying design to prevent engineered microbes from escaping into the ocean environment.Because the ocean surrounds us and touches each of our lives every day, this application will benefit the global community.As part of the prototype stage of our design, we are considering the environmental impact of the product in the oceans.Plastiback also has the added benefit of being able to collect plastic and degrade it, converting these fragments, especially microplastics which otherwise pollute the ocean and interfere with the lifecycles of marine organisms, into electricity.To prevent our engineered microbes from being released into the environment, we followed our host lab\u0092s guidelines for proper disposal of organic waste.Parley for the Oceans also sent us a typical sample of ocean plastic.Estimates of plastic in the ocean are currently derived from surveys by research crews hauling nets through the ocean and hand-counting pieces of plastic3.This included appropriate clothing, covered shoes, lab coats, goggles, and disposable gloves.When choosing bacteria to use in our microbial fuel cell for their special ability to degrade Terephthalic Acid(TPA), a by-product of PET plastic degradation, we were careful to select only BSL1 organisms.\u0093Bottles, Bags, Ropes and Toothbrushes: The Struggle to Track Ocean Plastics.\u0094 Nature 536.7616 (2016): 263\u0096265.When working with such chemicals, we were careful to only work under the fume hood.This being said, our future work includes testing bioengineered control mechanisms such as a kill switch or synthetic amino-acid dependency 2 to make the risk of escape and proliferation in the environment even smaller.Considering the implications of synthetic biology tools to the world beyond the lab, It is important to maintain safe and ethical use of engineered organisms.We transported materials between our lab and the Northeastern team\u0092s lab in sealed containment to prevent release.To prevent exposure, we wore basic personal protective equipment in the lab at all times.Plastiback\u0092s contribution to ocean plastic research will affect how well the effects of plastic pollution are neutralized.Plastiback, as an alternative to physical sampling, fills the gap in technology that can detect ocean plastic.", "keywords": "Plastiback methamphetamine production ecosystems nucleotide

that you have prostate cancer, alone in the bathroom of your house, will probably generate a psychological and emotional shock\u0094.The information obtained by the analysis of the survey results and the opinion of the different experts we talked with, showed that even though the best option may be the design a kit for laboratories, men (users) rather to undergo the test by themselves.By doing this, we were able to decide for the best possible way of detecting this illness in a way that most men would find friendly enough.We started by doing field research on how many men had been checked for prostate cancer.Some of the interviewees even told us men aren\u0092t necessarily afraid of the test but of the opinion other people may have of them.So, we see, this issue goes beyond medical reasons to the cultural conformation of the Costa Rican man, where getting touched, even for medical reasons, is mocked of, relating it to homosexuality or weakness.Figure 5.Reasons why interviewees haven\u0092t been checked for prostate cancer.With this questions, we found out that most men younger than 40 don\u0092t consider important to get checked for prostate cancer, since it is the main reason given for not being tested.Surprisingly, most men (Figure 6) preferred the \u0093pregnancy-test\u0094-like device, because they would get the results faster and wouldn\u0092t have to spare time in visiting a doctor.Beside from this interviews we had different meetings with representatives of several renowned pharmaceutical, biotechnological and medical companies in our country.Figure 4 shows the reasons men give for not being checked for the illness.Figure 4.Figure 2 shows that most of the people interviewed are men.We thought most men would prefer this over our second option, which was to go to a pharmacy and get a device like a pregnancy test that gave you the result anywhere.We discussed about the importance of generating non-invasive diagnosis systems and how the project we propose will appear as a way to reduce the mortality of prostate cancer, through early diagnosis.Figure 3. shows a vast majority of men have not been tested for prostate cancer in any way.This conversation was focused on the possibility of detecting prostate cancer by sensing a biomarker in urine samples.We talked with SPERATUM investigators and developers; this is a microARN cancer therapeutics company raised in our country (the first of its class).Integrated Human PracticeWhat do men know about their prostate?For our Integrated Human Practice, we decided to ask ourselves why

bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infection.\u0094 (1) And while this technique was discovered prior to antibiotic treatments, inconsistent results and a lack of understanding caused it to be almost completely overshadowed by antibiotics.As a continuation of the 2015 WLC iGEM team s project, we have taken the idea of phage therapy for treatment of bacterial infection to a new environment: the coral reefs.(1) Finally, while a phage\u0092s ability to mutate could be seen as a safety threat, it also provides a built-in mechanism to continue to infect bacteria that have adapted a resistance to the original strain.Without zooxanthellae, corals would bleach (lose color) and die due to a lack of adequate nutrient uptake (3).Hard coral species also use the fixed carbon during the production of their Calcium Carbonate skeleton (3).Because of this the coral are, in effect, stripped of their immune defenses, and their nutrient providers.If the S. marcescens infection could be wiped out with bacteriophage therapy (see our team\u0092s previous article on phage therapy below), the coral would have the potential for rehabilitation.2 Aug. 2016.Note: this article was written by last year s WLC iGEM team, we are using it as it still applies to this year s project.TolC is a protein comprised of 471 amino acids to compose a homotrimer that forms a tapered hollow cylinder 140\u00c5 in length: a 40\u00c5 long outer membrane barrel [the channel domain] that anchors a 100\u00c5 long helical barrel that projects across the periplasmic space [1].The protein is exported through translocase, such as AcrAB, then through the TolC periplasmic entrance [1].TolC\u0092s role in antibiotic efflux is what interests us as a target for fighting multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.The complicated structure of Elkhorn contains many large branches with a full-grown coral reaching up to twelve feet in diameter(1).Part of the reason Elkhorn is such an important component of reef building is its ability to grow very rapidly.But our reefs are threatened now as never before in a myriad of ways, from pollution, dredging and destruction of the physical reef, to disease and an increasingly acidic environment affecting many aspects of our lives and placing the future of our oceans in danger.One such pressing concern for the coastal reefs of the southern United States (such as those located along the Floridian coast) has been a decimation and massive decrease in the populations of the primary reef building coral of these reefs, Acropora palmata, otherwise known as Elkhorn coral.(2) Phage therapy works based on the bacteriophages\u0092 ability to lyse specific bacteria while not harming eukaryotic cells.The early founders of phage therapy made many mistakes that ultimately led to antibiotic treatments being favored over phage therapy.These numerous traits of our reefs, that affect so many global interactions, highlight just a few of the many benefits coral reefs provide for the earth we live on.(2) The ever increasing issue of antibiotic resistance has led to a phage research revival.The most significant cause of this scarcity, however, is rampant disease, largely caused by the human pathogen Serratia marcescens.Serratia marcescens, a pathogenic species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, is known to infect humans, as well as other animals.The goal being that a phage can be isolated that will bind to the S. marcescens TolC protein.Without the coral reefs and the solid structure they provide, erosion of beaches and shorelines would proceed at significantly higher rates due to the lack of wave dissipation that reefs provide.Without reefs, many larval fish species would lack an environment in which to develop or would lack a vital link (a food source for example) in the food chain they rely upon.(2) The bacteria are able to thrive in a wide variety of environments including soil, water, and the digestive tract of their host.Phage therapy has overcome many of the obstacles that cleared the way for antibiotics to take over, and is now in many ways superior to antibiotics.This way, phages specific to the Serratia tolC gene can be isolated without having to deal with any harmful bacteria in the lab.[4]Gossard, Kimberly A., \"Genetic Profiling of the White Pox Disease Coral Pathogen Serratia marcescens from the Florida Keys\" (2014).Honors Program Theses.Specifically, the infection of Elkhorn coral by S. marcescens or \u0093white pox\u0094 can be attributed to immense destruction of the coral reefs(4).Elkhorn coral has been subject to infection by S. Marcescens since the first outbreak of white pox in 1996.(4) Also, phages are very specific, making it difficult to kill the correct bacteria with the correct phages using the technology of the time.[1] Falkowski PG, Dubinsky Z, Muscatine L, and James W. Porter: \u0093Light and the Bioenergetics of a Symbiotic Coral.\u0094 BioScience: Vol.\"Human Pathogen Shown to Cause Disease in the Threatened Eklhorn Coral Acropora Palmata.\"(1) Modern technology has also allowed for the easy and effective isolation of phages without disrupting their function.(1) Phages have also been identified with coat proteins that are harder for the body to identify as foreign.First, phages can be very specific and can be programmed to target only the virulent bacteria so as to not damage the microbiomes or probiotics.Read on for a more detailed explanation of the premise and goals of this year s project.Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) is a vital reef-building coral native to the Caribbean.Finally, the researchers faced the issue of the phages being rapidly eliminated by the body and were unable to prevent it.Due to the overuse of antibiotics, alternative treatments like phage therapy have been sought.There are also small loops present on the sides of TolC that allow for phage binding or colicin attachment.While some at the time believed that they were viruses, many of the studies hinted at phages being an enzyme that was created by the bacteria.(3) The phages create two enzymes, hollins, which perforate the plasma membrane, and lysins, which attack the cell wall.Thanks to scientific advances, many of the original problems have been solved, and phages are now even superior to antibiotics in many ways.Because of the high efficiency of S. marcescens to utilize glycoprotein components in the mucus, it is able to completely outgrow any other bacteria present.(4) The lack of knowledge also led to very inconsistent reports causing Eaton, Bayne, and Jones to write a report which deemed the technique no better than prior treatments.In addition, while the body metabolizes antibiotics, lytic bacteriophages are constantly replicating in the host bacteria and thus grow exponentially in number.Because WLC is a Christian school, we want our projects to always be rooted in our faith, which is why we chose a project involving good stewardship of the Earth and its resources.(5) There is also much less risk of resistant bacteria forming as only the target bacteria will be infected while the others remain untouched.The new surge of research being done on phage therapy continues to reveal exciting new options for the technique.In the lysogenic phase, the viral genome integrates into the bacterial DNA and goes into a hibernation allowing the cell to replicate on its own until it enters the lytic cycle.Paper 5.Importance of Reef Building Coral and Associated SymbiontsThe importance of hard corals to the global ecosystem as we know it cannot be overestimated.(5) The lack of research and understanding also led to impurities being injected into patients, further infecting them, and denaturing the bacteriophages during isolation leaving them inactive.In the lytic cycle, the bacterium is used to create parts of the phage which are then assembled.The phages do this by injecting their DNA into the host.The reasons for the low population in recent years is due to a wide variety of pressures including predation and bleaching.The outer membrane protein common to many gram negative bacteria: TolC (see our team\u0092s pervious article on TolC below), can be cloned into a plasmid and function in E. coli.The bacteria can then enter one of two phases, the first of which is the lysogenic phase.& Hughes, C. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF TOLC: The Bacterial Exit Duct for Proteins and Drugs.If, and when, a bacteria does become resistant to a phage, it is much easier and faster to find a new bacteriophage than it is to develop a new antibiotic.These two processes for the fixing of carbon into usable molecules (such as glucose) and stable calcareous molecules are large contributors to the global carbon cycle.It is thought that the tunnel assembly is supported by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.TolC is interesting because unlike other efflux pumps, TolC bypasses the periplasm.This name is given because of its resemblance to elk antlers, in both shape and the brown color given by the photosynthetic protozoans living symbiotically inside the coral\u0092s tissue.Fortunately, modern technology has had more success with phages than the discoverers.At least one of the strains causing the infection (PDR60) can be traced back to human sewage.This protein interacts with the inner membrane translocases traffic ATPase and an adaptor protein.In 2005 it was added to the endangered species list and remains there today despite many efforts to restore and revive the population.In review, the trimer forms a single beta barrel for the passing of proteins.(5)While phage therapy is not a new technique, it has only recently started a comeback as a viable antibacterial treatment.Once a phage is isolated, it could potentially be used to treat infected coral.[1] \"What Is Phage Therapy?\"A review of the mechanisms that drive Serratia towards diverse lifestyles.Modern knowledge of bacteriophages gives hope that phage therapy will not only work with but surpass antibiotic treatment.Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria to reproduce.", "design": "", "human_practice":

students indicated a shift in opinion on the statement \u0093You are Familiar with GMO\u0092s\u0094 towards agreement with the survey statement, providing evidence that over the course of the camp we presented information in such a way as to admirably educate on the topic of Genetic Modification.Harrison, Elise, and Jack presenting at Biotech Info NightIn late September, we held an informational night for the students on our campus.Throughout the week, the students learned various concepts on bioengineering, and they also spent quality time in the lab completing hands-on procedures.It is humbling to see that no one did not know whether genetic engineering is ethical or not; they all had an opinion in the matter.In our forty-five minute discussion with these students, most of them were able to formulate a better perception of how GMOs work and how they are applied to our world.It was interesting to see that this particular answer in the survey did not change significantly.Before commencement of the camp, the students showed a general lack of knowledge and disagreement with the topic of familiarity with GMO\u0092s.After the camp completed, there were no responses indicating a lack of opinion, with all students showing disagreement with the question, providing confidence in the education provided throughout the week.After completion of the camp, the students showed a strong opinion on the statement presented, with all students indicating that they believed Genetically Modified Organisms were not inherently dangerous to human health.The last lab of the week, the students spent time examining living coral samples, invertebrates, and bacteria, among other microorganisms under various microscopes.Following the presentation, we had multiple students approach us and ask how they could get involved with the WLC iGEM team.Lastly, towards the end of the day, the students went to work on their group projects, preparing to present on and share past iGEM projects with each other.Overall, the post-camp surveys indicated that the students greatly enjoyed the camp, learned a lot, and would love to return for an advanced, or altered summer camp in future years!The students were asked to agree or disagree with the statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).After the presentation at Biotech Info Night, there seems to be more students who disagree that GMOs are dangerous to human health.The students were asked to agree or disagree with the statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).The camp finished off with a fun jeopardy style bioengineering game that the students seemed to enjoy immensely.During the summer, the 2016 WLC iGEM held a week-long bioengineering summer camp for high school students.In the lab, Dr. Henkel led the students through plating and culturing of microorganisms from an external source point, specifically, raw eggs, chicken, and beef.This shows that our presentation was successful in informing the students on various concepts of biotechnology.As a result of biotechnology info night, there seemed to be an increase in the knowledge and opinions formed by the students who attended.This was the perfect way to set the tone for the rest of our summer camp as we deal with not only basic biology, but also some controversial topics.We then dove headfirst into science, first with the Central Dogma of Biology prepared by Dr. Werner.We did not have much time to cover all the topics involved with biotechnology, but we were able to get the ideas into the students\u0092 minds.There is less variation in the students\u0092 answers.Following our discourse and our discussion on ethics, the students seemed more likely to disagree with the fact that these matters are unethical.The day wrapped up with the students putting the final touches on their presentations for Friday morning.Friday began with the last devotion of the week and quickly moved into the students presentations on past iGEM projects.In lab, after lunch, Harrison led the students through an integrated lab where the students performed PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, and a Restriction Digest.This project was a chance for them to see what iGEM was all about and hopefully get them more interested in joining an iGEM team when they get to college.Today was a very exciting and enjoyable day for the campers!The following graphs are the result of the surveys which allow for analysis on how successful our camp was for our students.Over the course of the camp, we sought to incorporate and discuss bacteriophages in great detail as they play an integral part in our current project.Most of these students have attended Christian schools all of their lives; therefore, a short conversation on the matter will not sway their minds.The students showed a very strong initial lack of knowledge on the issue of use of Genetic ally Modified Organisms for Medical Treatments.This graph is strongly indicative of the general lack of information in the community on Bacteriophages and their uses as shown by the large percent (80%) of responses that were in strong disagreement with the statement or selected \u0093I don\u0092t Know\u0094.Students were able to learn about the structure of DNA and how it becomes RNA with licorice and marshmallows.The pre-camp and post-camp responses to the statement \u0093GMOs are inherently dangerous to Human Health\u0094 indicate an initial lack of knowledge on this topic due to the large volume (40%) of \u0093I don\u0092t know\u0094 responses.This is great for the continuation of the 2017 iGEM team and we have begun to involve new members into our project.Gina first shared the principles of water with magnetic models so the students could understand the difference between hydrogen, ionic, and covalent bonding.However, it is encouraging to see how many students disagree with the statement.There was an almost unanimous vote in the post-survey among the students.Dr. Henkel had the students plate the prepared samples on selective plates in order to incorporate bacterial identification into the lab and introduce the concept of gram negativity and gram positivity among other differences used in bacterial identification.It was the student\u0092s turn to make bacteria glow red, and we used the plasmids they had isolated on Monday in the mini prep to do so.At the end of the day, we introduced the campers to the group project that they would be completing.The small scale science that we are performing in the lab this week really came to life.After the camp, the surveys showed a drastic split in survey response with a large number being in agreement and a large number being in strong disagreement.We advertised this event by passing out flyers at the tutoring center and asking professors of biology and chemistry to pass along the information to their students.Elise, Jack, and Harrison spoke to the eager undergraduates and they were also given a chance to ask questions of their own.The presentations went exceptionally well and although initially intimidated by the prospect of presenting for the class, the students excelled in their explanations of complicated genetic concepts and projects.After the student presentations, Dr. Balza presented on Coral biology and Morphology, helping further incorporate this year\u0092s project into the camp along with touring the schools coral reproduction systems and marine life support equipment.We had the undergraduates participate in a survey before the presentation and also after the presentation.The central placement of the responses was expected due to our measured and cautious approach in discussion of this issue and the rising issue of antibiotic resistance.We discussed the various applications of biotechnology along with the implications of our own project on coral and bacteriophages.After lunch we headed into the lab.We started the day with a devotion and light snack, progressing quickly into what turned out to be one of the campers favorite lectures; Biological safety and Warfare with Dr. Henkel.Back at Wisconsin Lutheran College, Dr. Werner walked us through the basics of genetic engineering before we went into the lab once again.The responses received pre-camp to this question showed a large information gap in antibiotic education received prior to camp attendance with a majority of students simply responding with a selection of \u0093I don\u0092t Know\u0094.We began with some review from the day before with a fun jeopardy game.Dr. Henkel took over for the rest of the day and began with the importance of medical microbes.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "We ended the meeting with an icebreaker and organizing team leads for each portion of our project; with lab work planned to begin next week.Lab activities this week consisted of the plasmid isolation of the tolC gene on pUC57 for Salmonella enteric, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholera in order to move to iGEM shipping plasmid pSB1C3.K. pneumonia, and E. coli which was largely worked on by Harrison and Melissa (the first trial had proven unsuccessful because of low DNA concentration).Jack contacted the various speakers for the camp and finalized the times that they would lecture.In the lab a gel electrophoresis protocol was performed by Harrison which determined that the second enzyme digest with the four tolC genes was unsuccessful.We also advertised the Bioengineering Summer Camp on our Facebook page.After a brief break in lab activities, work resumed by looking for bacteriophages that would bind to the TolC protein for S. marcescens.Meanwhile, Elise verified that many of the tolC genes were moved successfully into pTrc99A.The E. coli tolC gene from the previous week was extracted from the gel and a ligation to the pSB1C3 vector was attempted but was unsuccessful.Unfortunately, lab progressed fairly slowly due to our staff dedicating a majority of their time to the summer camp, but no regrets, as our students had a wonderful time.This was the highly anticipated week of the Bioengineering Summer Camp!We transformed these new plasmids into the tolC deletion strain of E. coli.The Biotech Info Night took place this week and Elise, Harrison, and Jack spoke to the 44 students in attendance.A new plasmid isolation was performed with the above tolC genes by Ching Tzu and Theresa Boyadjian with just the tolC genes for K. pneumonia and E. coli.Lab consisted of an enzyme digest using the products of the plasmid isolation from the previous week which was conducted by Harrison and Ching Tzu.The binders were filled with the PowerPoints of all of our lecturers and the lab was stocked with all the materials that would be needed.Summer Camp week!Gel electrophoresis by Harrison confirmed that the E. coli tolC gene was successfully removed from the plasmid.We really wanted to get as much of our wiki completed before Wiki Night to avoid the stress that comes from doing everything at the last minute.Elise and Ching-Tzu performed Western blots to verify our tolC gene expression on both plasmids.The campus cafeteria was also contacted to request lunch boxes for the campers during the day.We held our first meeting this week to get to know one another and to get an idea on the interests of our fellow teammates.The team also decided that we would be holding another Biotechnology Information Night on campus to better educate the new freshman on the various concepts.Additionally, we verified that all of the tolC genes had been successfully moved into the pTrc99A plasmid.We were prepared to welcome our students for a week of bioengineering fun!The week before summer camp was quite hectic.The school cafeteria was also informed on the number of campers and any concern of food allergies.This week was really focused on making sure that everything was prepared for the summer camp.Campers were asked to take the same survey before and after the summer camp to gauge the impact that our camp had on them.Overnight campers began to arrive on Sunday night and the rest of our campers joined us on Monday morning for a jam packed week.We set up a poster to give the new students a better idea of what iGEM really is.This was the first week back to school and the first time that the entire team was able to be together at once.In lab, Elise and Ching-Tzu verified that we successfully moved our three new BioBrick parts into the shipping plasmid!Committees were organized to help make things run more smoothly.The new part that was ordered arrived this week: the tolC gene for Serratia marcescens on pUC57 with the pBAD promoter.This week our wiki design was finalized and various parts of the project were sent to Troy to get uploaded onto our wiki.Additionally, Elise worked on Kirby Bauer assays with the strains that contained tolC genes on pTrc99A.Thursday night was our first meeting and we decided that there would be weekly meetings from now until the Giant Jamboree.Ligation of the E. coli tolC to pSB1C3 followed.Our project was solidified and plans began to form.We needed to put all the survey answers into bar graphs or pie charts.We started the design for our wiki.We also received survey responses from the WELS teachers which were then arranged onto pie charts to be analyzed.New freshman students were welcomed to campus this week.Jack and Harrison set up a table at the campus \u0093Org Smorg\u0094 to recruit for the iGEM team for the following year.We created lectures on viruses/phages and antibiotics.The t-shirt design for the summer camp was agreed upon with the entire team and were then ordered.Kirby Bauer Assays were done a final time with the strains containing all of the tolC genes on pTrc99A .More phage screening was done to attempt to isolate phages.Jack contacted MSOE to guarantee their involvement with the Bioengineering Summer Camp.Another round of camp flyers were sent out to WELS churches.The team discussed the easiest and most efficient ways that this could be advertised throughout campus.Elise and Ching-Tzu started again working on moving our BioBricks into the shipping plasmid.Thus beginning our lab activities for the year as a continuation of last year s project.After this, Harrison ran a gel of the restriction digests and a gel extraction.Restriction enzyme digest followed to remove the part from the plasmid.Read about the blast that we had with our students here.", "protocol": "", "result": "To avoid using any pathogenic strains in lab, we used the tolC genes of the various bacteria in an E. coli deletion strain that lacks the gene.Lane 1 is the pTrc99A plasmid with no tolC gene, lane 2 is E. coli tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid, lane 3 is Klebsiella tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid and lane 4 is Serratia tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid.Figure 2: Western blot Analysis of TolC Protein Production by Plasmid-Encoded tolC Genes on pUC57.The top right plate is our positive control, as it contains the pTrc99A plasmid with the E. coli tolC gene.Once the TolC proteins were confirmed to be produced and functional in the tolC deletion strain of E. coli, we used these strains to screen for bacteriophages.The bottom left plates contain Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumonia tolC genes on the pTrc99A plasmid respectively.Figure 4: Functional Variation in Pathogenic Bacterial TolC Proteins.Western blot analysis of the various strains containing plasmid encoded, pathogenic tolC genes demonstrate the production of the TolC protein (Figures 1 and 2).Alternatively, the genes can be expressed in pTrc99A, a medium copy number plasmid (Gel 1).Because TolC is necessary for antibiotic efflux, the presence of the protein in the outer-membrane increases antibiotic resistance.The Serratia tolC gene allows us to isolate bacteriophages specific to the Serratia TolC protein, which has potential for use in bacteriophage therapy of Elkorn coral, a highly endangered coral.However, our team plans to continue phage screening with these strains, especially the S. marcescens tolC strain: the goal being isolation of a TolC-specific phage that could be used in coral rehabilitation.After cloning the tolC genes into pTrC99A, we transformed the plasmids into a deletion strain of E. coli lacking the chromosomal tolC gene.This is likely because these tolC gene sequences are dramatically different than the E. coli tolC gene.The plasmid-encoded TolC proteins being produced in each strain are decreasing the minimum inhibitory zones (when compared to the strain containing only the plasmid).Previously, the purpose was to isolate bacteriophages that use TolC (an outer membrane protein) of pathogenic bacteria for infection.Reducing the copy number allowed better study of the function of TolC without the overproduction that occurs in a high copy number plasmid.These preliminary results do not show the induction we would expect, however, the protein is being produced.Figure 3: Functional Analysis of TolC Proteins.It is relevant to note that all of these bacteria, including E. coli normally contain the tolC gene, and therefore this gene modification will not result in increasing the pathogenicity of E. coli or causing this laboratory strain to be infectious in any way for humans.Each of the four plates was overlaid with top agar and a culture of E. coli that is lacking the chromosomal tolC gene.The average zones of inhibition in millimeters of multiple trials of Kirby-Bauer Antibiotic assays with standard deviation for both novobiocin and erythromycin is shown for each plasmid-encoded tolC gene.Various pathogenic tolC genes do not all work alike in E. coli.The top left plate demonstrates our negative control as it contains the pTrc99A plasmid with no tolC gene.We also added a new tolC gene, S. marcescens tolC, to our set of tolC genes of pathogenic bacteria.In the Kirby Bauer assays, the zones of inhibition, highlighted with a double headed arrow, demonstrate the minimum inhibitory concentration the antibiotics for each strain (Figure 3).Notably, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholera tolC genes do not appear to function in E. coli.Figure 1:Western blot Analysis of TolC Protein Production by Plasmid-Encoded tolC Genes on pTrc99A.Kirby-Bauer Antibiotic assays can be used to demonstrate functional TolC proteins.Notably, the production can be induced with arabinose when the plasmid with arabinose-inducible promoter is used (Gel 2).We first decided to move the tolC genes of pathogenic bacteria, namely: Escheria coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp.",

gold than the one recovered from 17 tons of gold ore [1].For these reasons we decided to make a project based on a eco-friendly bioleaching technology using two modified bacteria, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Chromobacterium violaceum, for recovering metals from the e-waste.Bioleaching is the process of metal extraction undertaken by microorganisms.We will also test it as a potential selectivity marker for C. violaceum under these alkaline conditions (pH=9.5).After gold is recovered in the third module, we will degrade the remaining cyanide, as it is too toxic to be released to the environment without previous treatment.We will use a different transformant of C. violaceum that will overexpress cyanide hydratase, a cyanide degrading enzyme.It was found that the pH of the original strain had come down to a pH of 0.63, thus all organic material was dissolved despite A. ferrooxidans being an acidophile.With the acid oxidation process used in Module I, metals such as copper, zinc and nickel are solubilized by A. ferrooxidans, but valuable metals like gold and silver are not.(see Modelling)It was transformed successfully with a pretty standard electroporation protocol (Broetto et al, 2005).We were able to transform it using iGEM\u0092s standard PSB1C3 plasmid with a calcium competency protocol for E. coliIn order to improve the efficiency of the process, we will modify C. violaceum using two basic constructs:Though C. violaceum is a native cyanide producer, this basal production is relatively low and regulated by quorum sensing.In a previous study, cyanide production was successfully uncoupled from quorum sensing regulation by transformation with hydrogen cyanide synthase (hcnABC) under pARA regulation (Tay et al, 2013).pGolS is a promoter that has been used previously by other iGEM teams.Pseudomonas fluorescens)It was shown by Pham & Ting (2009) that gold recovery with C. violaceum is more effective than with P. fluorescens as long as the e-waste has been pre-oxidized, as we have designed in Module I.It has already been studied as a bacteria of biotechnological interest because of its adaptability to different stresses.Chief among these characteristics, its resistance to heavy metals and ability to grow using many different carbon sources stand out, as was described by the Brazilian National Genome Project Consortium (2003), the team that first reported sequencing its genome.As it is a native cyanide producer, it is also highly resistant to it (Niven, Collins & Knowles, 1975).It is relatively easy to manage in the lab (similar enough to E. coli as to allow the use of very similar lab protocols)It grows in LB media, with observed population kinetics similar to E. coli.The overexpression of TetH in A. ferrooxidans leads to have a high expression of sulfates in the culture media, with more activity, more protons are released to the media and leads to a greater solubilization of metal ions.Overexpressing a specific gene in an organism, may affect cell\u0092s metabolism and growth rate.Thus, in order to mantain a pH = 9.5, a base has to be continously added to the reactor.Within our construct, the proton pump is regulated by a weak constitutive promoter from the Anderson collection, and the coding sequence is optimized for its expression in C. violaceum.From module I, elemental sulfur is produced due to the metabolism of A. ferrooxidans.We optimized the original sequence for C. violaceum and used this system along with Hydrogen Cyanide Synthase operon hcnABC in order to create a self-regulatory system that activates in the presence of gold, increasing cyanide production and enabling the solubilization of this precious metal as [Au(CN)2]\u0096.Hydrogen cyanide synthase generates HCN, not free CN- ions.In fact, Brown, Turner, and O reilly (1995) reported that a modified E. coli reached 5.5 times the cyanide degrading activity compared to that observed in the native F. lateritium.Broetto, L., Cecagno, R., Sant anna, F. H., Weber, S., & Schrank, I. S. (2005).Science of The Total Environment, 408(2), 183-191. doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.044The first microorganism implemented onto our three step synbio system, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, is a chemoautotrophic bacteria that thrives in very acidic pH (1.5 to 3.0).In the mining industry, it has been established that a pH > 9.4 is ideal (Marsden & House, 2006), as at lower pH values not enough HCN is dissociated; and at higher pH values other factors (such as salinity) become more important.As shown in the modelling section, the overall gold solubilizing reaction generates H+.Thanks to the acidic conditions of A. ferrooxidans Fe(II) is stable and Fe(III) is more soluble than at standard pH (7.0)Phase I: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was obtained from the Geomicrobiology Laboratory of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potos\u00ed, which was isolated from a mine in Durango, Mexico.Due to these alarming problematics, our main motivation for the project is to create a novel synbio system to improve the e-waste recycling technology and make it a feasible approach to reduce the pollutants, and generating a business model with the recycling of these valuable metals.E-waste contains valuable metals as well as potential environmental contaminants.C. violaceum has several characteristics that make it ideal for our project:It is more suited for the project compared to other bacteria that could also be used for cyanide bioleaching.From module I, ions of Fe+2 are produced due to the metabolism of A. ferrooxidans.The composite part BBa_K2055025 uses the T7 system in order to express the enzyme sulfur reductase, which catalyzes the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of elemental sulfur in the presence of oxygen, with sulfite and hydrogen sulfide as products.Figure 3.From Table 1, it can be observed that copper, silver and gold be reduced to a neutral charge spontaneously when coupled with the H2S half-cell.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 100(20), 11660-11665. doi:10.1073/pnas.1832124100 Rin\u00e1gelov\u00e1, A., Kaplan, O., Vesel\u00e1, A.The protocol for the bioleaching experiments consisted in adding 1 g of slag per liter of medium in a flask containing A. ferrooxidans in a set exponential phase.CueR is a transcription factor that stimulates the transcription at the pgolS promoter when bound to copper or gold, as was described by iGEM York 2013.Both mediums were adjusted to a pH of 4.0 and autoclaved at 121 Celsius for 15 min.A first experiment was carried to evaluate the growth of the bacteria in liquid medium with elemental sulfur and sodium thiosulfate.We retrieved this sequence from ferrooxidans\u0092 genome and ran a nucleotide blast to find similitudes with other promoters just as done by the Ribeiro\u0092s article.Inverted operon with a Ferric Uptake Regulator & a LacI coding sequences.It follows that this construct increases its own expression through positive feedback in the presence of gold or copper through the production of a copper/gold sensitive protein.Cloning and heterologous expression of a sulfur oxygenase/reductase gene from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus sp S5 in Escherichia coli.The electrical potential difference between the two electrodes can be used as power source to feed a small device or be stored in a battery for its later use.Figure 1.It is commonly used by mining companies for the industrial recovery of metals such as Zn, Ni and Cu from residual dirt and waste materials from their processes.As the pgolS promoter has a basal transcription level, some CueR would be constantly expressed.Group 1 had 10 g/L of elemental sulfur, group 2 had 10 g/L of sodium thiosulfate and group 3 had 5 g/L of elemental sulfur + 5 g/L of sodium thiosulfate.The groups of the experiment consisted in: (1) Control medium without bacteria, (2) Control medium with bacteria without genetic modifications, (3) Bacteria with tetH overexpression.The flasks were incubated for 15 days, taking aliquotes the days 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 to analyze the metal content with ICP-OES, then the data would be compared to the original ewaste and the metals solubilized were calculated.After being washed three times with distilled water, the solid residues of the bioleach treatment or the acid medium treatment were transferred to the Chromobacterium violaceum alkaline bioleaching phase of our MetalEca process.A.When iron is in a sufficient concentration, it makes a complex with the FUR protein which then binds to the FURBOX inhibiting LacI transcription, activating the pLac promoter and the transcription TeTH sequence for protein synthesis.The characterization of the part would be done using an RFP coding sequence, instead of the production of TetH.As a result, most of the electronic waste is dumped in landfills where it is burned with other wastes generating dioxins, hydrogen chloride and other compounds that directly affect the environment.It was expected that the curve of the group 3 had the biggest slope value.Unfortunately three weeks after our first inoculum we lost our strain due to a failure in the pH measurements, when we tried to inoculate them again to fresh media cells would not grow.The solubilised metals are going to be then used in the galvanic cell, but they will have to reduced or oxidised first.Figure 2.Sulfur reductase is used to catalyze the reduction of elemental sulfur in the presence of oxygen, with sulfite and hydrogen sulfide as products.Metals recovered with Chromobacterium violaceum.The solubilised metals are going to be then used in the reduction half-cell.TetH is involved in the electron transfer for A. ferrooxidans.[4] Monterrey is the leading city with a high concentration of PM10 particles among Latin American countries.It is estimated that industrial activities and \u0093primitive\u0094 e-waste recycling techniques are among the main factors for the release of these type of particles into the atmosphere [3].Expression of the cyanide hydratase enzyme from Fusarium lateritium in Escherichia coli and identification of an essential cysteine residue.The reaction increases the acidity of the media and releases sulfates, which chelate metals.For the bioleaching process, e-waste was washed three times with distilled water to diminish the natural basic pH of the metals.In a galvanic cell, the element with the higher (or more positive) reduction potential gets reduced and the one with the lower (or more negative) reduction potential gets oxidized.To solve this problem, we will use two control mechanism to inhibit gene expression when not needed: a temperature induced promoter (HSP) and an iron induced inverted operon (FUR/FURBOX).Heat Shock Promoter is a ?32-dependent promoter for for the Afe_1437 gene in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Ribeiro, D. A.,2011).BLAST analysis revealed that the translated golS protein included in the part submitted by York 2013 has a 100% homology with CueR from Salmonella typhimurium.The metropolitan area is considered as the most polluted in Latin America in terms of air quality [2].First, without the presence of iron, the lactose inhibits the pLac promoter.One of the main reasons is the high concentration of PM10 in the atmosphere, particles so small that they are able to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause a wide variety of pulmonary and heart diseases, leading to a premature death.For further information on these control mechanisms and the rest of our parts, please go to the Parts section of our wiki.Although iron is the most abundant transition metal on Earth, its solubility is very low at neutral pH in aerobic environments.In the case of nickel and zinc, they can\u0092t be reduced by sulfur oxidation, they needs to be recovered by using an electric current or in another cell arrangement.In the left side, the oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur occurs.However, the recovery of these last two metals is vital in making the process economically viable, due to their high market value and relative scarcity.[2]The main benefit of using recycled metals over their virgin materials is the significant energy saved, almost 95%!This promoter is induced by gold, through the binding of transcriptional activator GolS with gold, which later binds to the recognition site of the promoter allowing for higher expression of genes in the presence of gold.Using the reduction potentials of the metallic ions in the solutions, we established a spontaneous reaction by coupling them with the oxidation of S2- from H2S into S0.Thus, our construct is constituted by the pgolS promoter and the coding sequence of CueR.In the right side, the reductions occur and the recovery of metals occur.\u00c7olak, D., et al.Since free CN- ions are responsible for the reaction that solubilizes gold, we must take into account the dissociation of HCN.Also the expression of the desired gene will tend to decrease over time.The reaction that takes place is illustrated in the following figure:Figure 1.The agar medium was made with the same concentrations, only 12.5 g/L was added.Journal of General Microbiology,90(2), 271-285. doi:10.1099/00221287-90-2-271Tay, S. B., Natarajan, G., Rahim, M. N., Tan, H. T., Chung, M. C., Ting, Y. P., & Yew, W. S. (2013).Its mechanism underlies on the transformation of solid metal compounds into soluble products that can be easily extracted and recovered, due to the catabolism of microorganisms.An effective way to solubilize them is by bioleaching with a cyanide-producing organism such as C. violaceum.Monterrey is one of the leading industrialized cities in Mexico, but this growth has led to many environmental and health issues.The enzyme tetrathionate hydrolase (TetH), which is produced inside the bacteria and then taken out to the external matrix, constantly converts tetrathionate to two molecules: thiosulfate and elemental sulfur.We added bromocresol green (0.5% V/V) on the petri dishes in order to identify the colonies and calculate the colony-forming unit of each experimental group.Tetrathionate is a key intermediate during RISC oxidation, hydrolyzed by tetrathionate hydrolase (TetH), and used as sole energy source.http://www.cleanairinstitute.org/calidaddelaireamericalatina/cai-report-english.pdfGangwar, C., Singh, A., Kumar, A., Chaudhry, A. K., & Tripathi, A.Ferrooxidans is an acidophilic bacteria that turns its own culture media into a more acidic environment to satisfy its growing conditions.Iron oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, giving it a big enough reduction potential for its reduction to happen spontaneously.", "design": "", "human_practice": "Later CVR agreed to provide us with the shredded e-waste for our project.After this, we involved our community in different events aimed to create consciousness about e-waste pollution and the dreadful consequences of incorrect e-waste disposal.Meeting with CVR, one of the few certified e-waste recycling companies in Mexico.This aspect is reflected in our numerous events, evidence we saw on the enormous pile of e-waste we collected during four days, weighing almost a ton!We knew that informing our community about the issues we face every day and how synthetic biology is a powerful tool able to fix them wouldn\u0092t be enough.We also wanted to inform as much people as we could about the different ways in which they could participate and come up with solutions to help us improve our current situation.We sent this huge amount of e-waste to CVR, a certified recycling company, where it could be treated correctly.Throughout this process, our experience allowed us to evaluate and reshape our project according to society\u0092s needs.", "modeling": "This time, however, there is no basal expression and the degradation constant is the same, so we only expand upon equation eqref{eq:ECell} adding the production rate modeled by the Hill equation with Hill coefficient (n = 1): frac{dE_{Cell}}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}} + frac{gamma AuCN_{in}}{K_{E} + AuCN_{in}} - delta_{E}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} + k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} It should be noted that the overexpression of HCN synthase is activated after the regular expression regulated by quorum sensing as it depends on the detection of dicyanoaurate(I) ion.We will use the following parameters in the development of the model:Diffusion parameter for the autoinducer outside the cellConcentration of CviR-AHL complex (2 AHL and 2 CviR molecules)Rate constant for AHL production due to CviI concentrationRate constant for the formation of CviR-AHL complexRate constant for the dissociation of the CviR-AHL complexRate of AHL diffusion across the membrane for each cellCviI production parameter due to bound CviR-AHL to the promoterCviR-AHL concentration occupying half of the binding sitesConcentration of HCN synthase inside C. violaceum (non-active)Concentration of HCN synthase in C. violaceum\u0092s membrane (active)HCN synthase production parameter due to bound CviR-AHL to the promoterConcentration of HCN synthase complexed with glycineConcentration of HCN synthase complexed with glycine and two acceptorsAu concentration (amount of solid gold in the reaction tank)Rate of dicyanoaurate(I) ion diffusion across the membrane for each cellHCN synthase production parameter due to bound (\text{Au}pars{\text{CN}}_2^{-}) to the promoter(\text{Au}pars{\text{CN}}_2^{-}) concentration occupying half of the binding sites We start by proposing a model for the population growth.So we re-write equation eqref{eq:EMemb} and write the kinetic equations for (G), (C_1), (C_2), (Ac), (HCN) and (AcH_2): frac{dE_{Memb}}{dt} = -k_{EC}E_{Memb}G + k_{CP}C_{2}+k_{CE}C_{1} + k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell}-k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} These equations describe the HCN production by following the intermediate steps where the enzyme binds to glycine and the acceptors.Initially, the solution will contain (Fe^{+2}) that will be diffused through the cell membrane according to Fick s first law of diffusion: This iron will combine with the protein Fur to form a complex which we will call (C_{1}) according to the reaction: F_{in} + Fur overset{k_{FC}}{underset{k_{CF}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{1} frac{dF_{in}}{dt} = k_{FC}FurF_{in} + k_{CF}C_{1} The complex (C_{1}) will act as an inhibitor to the expression of the proteins Fur and LacI, so their expression rates will be: frac{dFur}{dt} = alpha_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{C_{1}}{K_{1}}} - delta_{Fur}Fur frac{dLacI}{dt} = alpha_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{C_{1}}{K_{1}}} - delta_{LacI}LacI LacI also acts as an inhibitor to the expression of the enzyme Tetrathionate hydrolase.Taking into account the basal production in the absence of CviR-AHL and the degradation of (E), we get: frac{dE}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}}-delta_{E}E The enzyme then proceeds to insert itself into the membrane where it is active and can produce HCN.So, the expression of TetH is given by: frac{dTetH}{dt} = \beta_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{LacI}{K_{2}}} - delta_{TetH}TetH Figure 1: As Fur-Fe(^{2+}) complex appears, it inhibits LacI production and the existing LacI degradates.It is known that the reaction for TetH is given by: TetH + S overset{k_{TC}}{underset{k_{CT}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{2} overset{k_{CS}}{\rightarrow} SO_{4}^{-2} + S_{2}O_{3}^{-2} + 2:H^{+} + TetH dfrac{dTetH}{dt} = -k_{TC}(TetH)(S) + k_{CT}C_{2} + k_{CS}C_{2} frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = k_{TC}(TetH)(S) - k_{CT}C_{2} - k_{CS}C_{2} Notice that the pH of the solution will diminish because of the production of (H^{+}) by TetH.The chemical-like reaction of insertion (and withdraw) would be the following: Therefore the equations that describe HCN synthase (before its overexpression) would be: frac{dE_{Memb}}{dt} = k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} frac{dE_{Cell}}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}} - delta_{E}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} + k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} We proceed to analyze the production of HCN using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics.Because the degradation of mRNA molecules occurs much faster than the degradation of proteins, the system quickly falls in a quasi-steady-state where (frac{dm}{dt}=0) and the concentration of m at that time is: Substituting back in the equation for (\rho(t)) we have: where (alpha=frac{k_{1}k_{0}}{delta_{m}}) is the constant expression rate.The equations that describe this transitions are: E_{Memb} + G &overset{k_{EC}}{underset{k_{CE}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{1}\\ C_{1} + 2: Ac &overset{k_{CC_1}}{underset{k_{CC_2}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{2}\\ C_{2} overset{k_{CP}}{\rightarrow} HCN +&: CO_{2} + 2: AcH_2 Figure 5: This graph shows the consumption of glycine and the acceptor taking into account all the equations described in this model (i.e.Writing the chemical kinetics following the law of mass action, we get: frac{dR^{ast}}{dt} = k_{QS_1}A^2pars{R_T-2R^{ast}}^2 - k_{QS_2}R^{ast} To describe the transcription from DNA to a product protein we can use the equations (Ingalls, 2012): frac{dm}{dt}=k_{0} - delta_{m}m(t), qquad frac{d\rho}{dt}=k_{1}m(t) - delta_{\rho}\rho(t), where (m) and (\rho) represent the concentration of mRNA molecules and product protein, (delta_m) and (delta_\rho) represent their degradation constants, (k_0) is the transcription rate from DNA to mRNA and (k_1) is the transcription rate from mRNA to (\rho).Adding the production of (HCN) and its reaction with gold, we get: frac{dHCN}{dt} = 8pars{-k_{fAuCN}HCN^{8}Au^{4} + k_{rAuCN}AuCN_{out}^4}Au^{2/3} + k_{CP}C_2 Figure 7: Following our approximation of gold cyanidation, this graph shows the dissolution of gold pebbles by HCN produced by C. violaceum.It should be noted that C. violaceum produces HCN, whose dissociation equation is: To simplify the process we combine both reactions to obtain: 4: Au + 8: HCN + O_{2} overset{k_{fAuCN}}{underset{k_{rAuCN}}{\rightleftharpoons}} 4: Au(CN)_{2}^{-} + 2: H_{2}O + 4: H^{+} It is important to note that the combination of these equations may create some deviations against the real cyanidation process.Writing the equation for (A) will give us: frac{dA}{dt} = -2k_{QS_1}A^2(R_{T} - 2R^{ast})^2 + 2k_{QS_2}R^{ast} + k_{QS_0}I-r_{QS}(A-A_{ext}) We also include an expression for (A_{ext}) considering diffusion through the cell.We will assume that the more TetH is produced, the more Copper will be dissolved according to the reaction: Cu + Fe_{2}(SO_{4})^{-2}_{3},\rightleftharpoons, Cu^{+2} + 2:Fe^{+2} + 3:SO_{4}^{-2} The amount of dissolved (Fe^{+2}) in the medium will also increase.A glycine molecule binds to a HCN synthase in the membrane, forming a complex (C_1).We then use simple kinetics to model the reaction as if it were homoge- neous but with a simple modification: frac{dAu}{dt}=4pars{-k_{fAuCN}HCN^{8}Au^{4} + k_{rAuCN} AuCN_{out}^4}Au^{2/3} As noted in the equations above, a (Au^{2/3}) term was added.Figure 4: Following the population growth model from Figure (3) and the equations described in this section, we obtained a model for the concentration of CviI, which shows the steep switch-like activation of the quorum sensing mechanism.The reaction that occurs between the unbound CviR and AHL can be expressed as follows: If we consider that the total amount of CviR is fixed, the amount of unbound CviR can be given by (R = R_T \u0096 2 R^{ast}), this is evident from the previous equation because two CviR monomers are needed in order to create a CviR-AHL complex.We will use the following parameters in the development of the model:Average concentration of (Fe^{2+}) inside A. ferroxidansAverage concentration of (Fe^{2+}) outside A. ferroxidansRate of (Fe^{2+}) diffusion across the membrane for each cellAverage concentration of Fur complexed with (Fe^{2+})Rate constant for the dissociation of (C_1) complexBasal expression of the cassette (coding for Fur and LacI)(C_1) concentration occupying half of the binding sitesLacI concentration occupying half of the binding sitesRate constant for the dissociation of (C_2) complexRate constant for the formation of the products of (C_2) We will not consider the reactions going on outside the cell in order to simplify the model.It is also produced linearly by CviI and we need to take into account that the degradation of (R^{ast}) liberates 2 molecules of (A).Following Fick\u0092s Law of diffusion we get: With this description of the diffusion of the ion, we can model the over-expression of HCN synthase as we have previously done so with CviI and HCN synthase in equations eqref{eq:I} and eqref{eq:E0}.The promoter that encodes for this enzyme is regulated by a quorum sensing mechanism: a process through which bacteria sense the population density in their close surroundings with the help of the autoinducer (signaling molecule) N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL).Hydrogen cyanide produced by C. violaceum is generated by the enzyme HCN synthase, whose expression is regulated by quorum sensing.As (A) is going to be diffused through the cell membrane, we apply Fick\u0092s Law of diffusion.The chemical equation describing gold cyanidation is: 4: Au + 8: CN^{-} + O_{2} + 2: H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons 4: Au(CN)_{2}^{-} + 4: OH For the kinetics of the reaction we will consider O(_2) concentration as constant due to the fact that oxygen can be constantly supplied to the reactor tank and small variations have little effect on the reaction speed.A term is added for concentrations that diffuse far away from the cell population and don\u0092t contribute to the reaction: Equations eqref{eq:CviI}, eqref{eq:I}, eqref{eq:A}, eqref{eq:Aext}, along with the population growth equation eqref{eq:P}, describe the process know as quorum sensing.This happens because A. ferrooxidans obtains its energy by oxidizing (Fe^{2+}) to (Fe^{3+}) and producing (SO_{4}^{2-}) during a process of electron exchange in the membrane.In order to increase HCN production with the objective of dissolving gold, a genetic modification to overexpress HCN synthase is proposed.One of the modifications made to C. violaceum is the addition of a cassette that overexpresses HCN synthase.Because CviI is part of an autoregulated gene circuit with positive feedback and (R^{ast}) acting as a promoter, then the transcription of CviI can be expressed as: frac{dI}{dt}=a_0 + frac{aR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}}-delta_{I}I Here (alphaequiv a_0) for the basal production and (alphaequiv a) for the production where (R^{ast}) promotes the transcription.Although the time scale given is accurate for the population, this only shows the expected behavior as the rates of HCN production and gold cyanidation are unknown.Assuming perfect spheres of solid gold with an average diameter, we concluded that the proportion of superficial area to the amount of undissolved gold would be ([Au]^{2/3}).We will work with a constant pH of 9 (pH inside the reactor tank can be measured and controlled by a device that liberates a base into the solution, this came from previous simulations where there were significant pH changes; equation eqref{eq:mergeAuCyan} has protons as a product, this also suggested the team to work with a proton pump).Because the focus of this mathematical model is to describe the bio-bricks and gold cyanidation is a very complex field of study, the latter is beyond our scope and so we will take a simplified approach.We propose a behavior similar to the law of mass action on the basis that the probability of the insertion into the membrane will depend on the amount of (E) in the cell and that it should reach an equilibrium where the membrane gets to a saturated status for that specific amount of (E).It demonstrates a clear dependence on both glycine and the acceptor for HCN production: as long as there is a healthy population, there will be a production of HCN given that there are enough resources.Studies have found that a number of phenotypic characteristics in C. violaceum such as the production of violacein, hydrogen cyanide, antibiotics and exoproteases are regulated by the endogenous N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone through the process of quorum sensing.As this enzyme is encoded in the same cassette where CviI is encoded, it is also regulated by CviR-AHL and so the production rate of can be modeled in the same way.For this we add the population term (p) because each cell is going to be producing the molecule and contributing to the extracellular space.We will also consider the same population model we used for Chromobacterium violaceum in the section below.Figure 8: An increased slope clearly shows the effect of the overexpression of HCN synthase.For this reason, it is important that we take into consideration the diffusion of the ion across the membrane.Because of this, there will be some enzymes inside the cell and others will be in the membrane.Equation eqref{eq:AcH2} describes the concentration of reduced acceptors, however it can be ignored in the simulation as it is a final byproduct.In C. violaceum the quorum sensing mechanism also produces an enzyme called HCN synthase, which we will call (E).We will use the quorum sensing model for Vibrio fischeri due to the similarities with the chemical species present in C. violaceum.In the process of bioleaching A. ferrooxidans can be considered a clean alternative because it does not produce toxic residues.Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a bacterium who usually lives in very acid environments (1.5-2 pH), it can be found mostly in acid mine drainage, and have the amazing property of being able to convert insoluble metals to their soluble state.For the regulation of the mechanism, a promoter inducible by dicyanoaurate(I) ion is used.The derivation of the Michaelis-Menten equation requires that the amount of synthase remains constant but this is not the case.Figure 3: Experimental data and fitted growth model of C. violaceum with growth rate constant (r = 0.0156\text{ min}^{-1}) and carrying capacity (K_P = 1.3344) OD(_{600}).C.To increase the efficiency of the process our team proposed a mechanism in which Tetrathionate Hydrolase (TetH) is produced.However, we expect population to show the following behavior: where (P_0) is the initial concentration: (P(0) = P_0).This way, overexpression will only happen in the presence of gold.Since there shouldn\u0092t be any threats to the population during the project\u0092s processes and the medium will be kept well nourished within the time it involves, it can be assumed that the population will grow until it reaches an equilibrium in the medium because of the limited carrying capacity.The differential equation that describes this behavior is: where (P) is the total C. violaceum concentration at a given moment, (r) is the growth rate and (K_P) is the carrying capacity.Its mechanism is extremely complicated due to the fact that it involves interactions between liquids and solids, it\u0092s an heterogeneous reaction.Figure 6: This graph shows HCN synthase inside C. violaceum and in its membrane (in arbitrary units).However, as we have stated, cyanidation is not our main focus and we have found this to considerably simplify our simulations of the model while maintaining the rest of the processes intact.Figure 2: As LacI concentration goes down, the expression of TetH is allowed.Chromobacterium violaceum is defined as a saprophyte bacteria, which is normally considered to be nonpathogenic for humans, and it is found in soil and water samples of tropical and sub-tropical areas of several continents.The promoter for this cassette is activated by the presence of the dicyanoaurate(I) ion.(2009) The Chemistry of Gold Extraction.The reverse reaction of the dissolution inside the cells can be dismissed because of the lack of nucleation sites.This was derived from the consideration that the reaction speed depends upon the superficial area of solid gold.A limit is reached when there are no resources left for the enzyme to catalyze the production (i.e.Using a regression algorithm we obtained the growth rate constant (r) and the carrying capacity constant (K_P) resulting in a value of (\text{R}^2 = 0.9956).This equation will be solved numerically along with the ones presented in the following sections to facilitate their coupled solution.It was firstly observed during the second half of the XIX century and it was named after its violet coloration, which is given by violacein.We took into account an approximation of OD(_{600}) to number of cells (p=P\times10^8) ((P) being the population density in OD(_{600}) and described by equation eqref{eq:P}).To get a better insight of the behavior of our descriptions, we simulate the processes in Matlab\u00ae.Gold cyanidation is a complex process in which solid particles of gold are transformed into dicyanoaurate(I) ion (Au(CN)^?_2) in the presence of cyanide.", "notebook": "Also, transformations were made of RFP (20F) in E.

the advantages of introducing a new chassis to iGEM that can be transformed using the standard plasmid.Characterization of BBa_R0010 in Chromobacterium violaceumWe characterized the promoter BBa_R0010 in a novel chassis, C. violaceum.We measured the composition of the slag with the technique Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Juan Jos\u00e9 Cort\u00e9s helped us with the procedure and we obtained these results.The weight of the dry slag after the digestion was 0.327 grams, therefore, the total grams of metal per gram of slag must be of 0.673, there are 0.0219 grams of metals left to calculate the composition so we asked Julio Rivera to conduct an ICP-OES to calculate them and we obtained these results.Therefore for our model, we know what is the maximum solubilization of metals.Heat shock transformation of Chromobacterium violaceum with the RFP-generator (BBa_J04450)We successfully transformed a novel chassis, Chromobacterium violaceum.There were no significant difference in the fluorescence of the between the induced and uninduced groups of C. violaceum, whereas in E. coli it showed normal induction and a clear difference of RFP expression when the inductor was added to the bacteria.We also showed that the part BBa_J04450 can be used as a reporter gene in a novel chassis, Chromobacterium violaceum.This part is a proton pump generator that is regulated by a weak constitutive promoter from the Anderson collection.However, in previous experiments we noticed that one of these two constructs actually reduced the viability of the bacteria, thus we determined it was not a reliable control group for our experiment.We adapted standardized E. coli protocols for calcium competency and heat shock transformation, successfully transforming C. violaceum.As seen in the figure, we tried preparing the calcium competent cells at different optical densities and transformed using different durations of heat shock.We transformed BL21 E. coli with three different constructs, one coding for the proton pump, and, as control groups, two constructs that consisted of the same plasmid as our proton pump (pUC-IDT, which has ampicillin resistance), but without the actual coding sequence for the proton pump.CueR is a transcription factor that stimulates the transcription at the pgolS promoter when bound to copper or gold, as was described by the iGEM York 2013.We calculated an average of the three replicates for each transformed strain and graphed the data in order to determine if the proton pump had a significant effect on the survivability of the bacteria.Thus, this construct increases its own expression through positive feedback in the presence of gold or copper through the production of a copper/gold sensitive protein.As the pgolS promoter has a basal transcription level, some CueR would be constantly expressed.Nevertheless, a basal activity for the fluorescence was found in the following graphWe used 2 different concentrations of copper as well as 4 different compositions of the shredded e-waste that CVR provided.Although transformation using an electroporation protocol had been described before, there was no previous report of a heat shock transformation of C. violaceum.The strain transformed with the proton pump had an exponential growth phase, while the others couldn\u0092t resist the alkaline pH and had minimal growth.Additionally, we used the RFP-generator (BBa_J04450) in pSB1C3 in the transformation.This modification to bacterial cell membrane may increase stress resistance under alkaline conditions.Characterization of the golS promoter in Chromobacterium violaceumWe submitted a new part: BBa_K2055369.Our conclusion is that the promoter BBa_R0010 can be used as a constitutive promoter in C. violaceum.BBa_R0010 is lacI regulated, however, we were unable to confirm whether or not C. violaceum produces lacI natively through a literature search, and BLAST analysis of its genome suggested that it does not have this regulating system.This was necessary because, as C. violaceum produces a native purple pigment (violacein), we were curious as to whether RFP would be useful as a reporter gene.In C.Violaceum, this part expressing the RFP, did not presented an inducible activity in the e-waste copper and gold compositions that Tec-Monterrey 2016 worked with.", "safety": "",

(B) Standing for the adsorbed mercury ions.(B) The effective adsorption rate of Hg2+ by engineered E. coli.Additionally, the presence of engineered E. coli did not affect fish growth.To examine the specificity of the biosensor, the fluorescence responses of GFP-MC toward various metal ions, including Cd2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Mo6+, Ni2+, Hg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Ag+, Zn2+, and Cu2+, were studied under the same conditions.After MC binding of Hg2+ on the surface, the fluorescence emission of GFP-MC is quenched.Figure 10: (A) Rarefaction analysis of the different fish.An energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system was used to verify the cells and it verifies that the black spots were the MC accumulated Hg2+ (Figure 8-C).The results showed that the mercury ions were adsorbed on GFP-MC protein-displayed cells by surface display system.With the increase in the concentration of Hg2+ from 0 to 100 ?M, fluorescence of GFP-MC decreased continually.This strategy was adopted for targeting the GFP-MC to the surface of E. coli.(C) EDXA measurement of the box from (D) The control TEM images of E. coli BL21.Mercury content in the Control 1 fish decreased by 62.5% compared to Control 2.As shown in Figure 8 (A) the GFP-MC was on the cell surface and was approximately 500 nm in size.Ice nucleation protein (INP) is an extrinsic membrane protein; since the truncated version of INP only contains the N-terminal domain, which is the anchor membrane and GFP-MC, the fusion protein was displayed on the surface of E. coli, without any adverse effects on cell growth and integrity.Moreover, the coexistence of other metal ions showed no obvious interference in Hg2+ assays (Figure 4-B).The concentration of mercury in the fish of Control group 1 was 0.49 \u00b5g/g, while that in control group 2 was 1.664 \u00b5g/g and in the experimental group, it was 0.623 \u00b5g/g.Figure 4:(A) Selectivity of the IC sensing system.Figure 2: (A) Fluorescence images of engineering E. coli cells.A protein band of 43 kDa, corresponding to the correct size of INP-N-GFP-MC, was detected from cells containing recombinant plasmid (Figure 1, lane 7).The calibration curve of the concentration dependence of Cu2+ showed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9846) in the concentration ranging from 0 to 20 uM (Figure 5 A-B).An outer membrane protein INP-N was fused to the GFP-MC gene, creating an INP-GFP-MC which was designated pET23b/INP-GFP-MC (Figure 1-A).The fluorescence emission spectra of GFP-MC with different Hg2+ is shown in Figure 3 (a).From the Hg2+ concentration-dependent calibration curve, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9803) in the concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 ?M was obtained (Fig.In this display system, the MC can bind mercury to iron through immobilization on the surface of cells.Comparatively, the fluorescence quenching induced by Hg2+ is weaker than Cu2+.Figure 5:(A) Fluorescence spectra of IC (OD600 = 1.3) in the presence of Cu2+ with varying concentrations.This result shows that the MC has been displayed on the cell surface of E. coli, using ice nucleation protein as an anchoring motif.Figure 6:(A) Fluorescence spectra of IC (OD600 = 1.3) in the presence of Cd2+ with varying concentrations.Thus, GFP-MC can be used for the detection of lower concentrations of Cd2+.The LMR11 samples were closely related to the LMR12 samples, whereas the LMR9 and LMR10 samples were distant from the other samples along PCoA2, which represented 24.29% of the total variations (Figure 10-B).Thus, the engineered strain can be used as a feed additive agent to alleviate heavy metal contamination of fish.In the experimental group, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were increased, compared to Control 2, while Fusobacteria and Tenericutes decreased.Fish growth was significantly influenced by the presence of 0.1 mg/l Hg2+.From the Cd2+ concentration-dependent calibration curve, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9977) in concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 ?M was obtained (Fig.In conclusion, it is important that the fodder containing the engineered strain does not affect normal growth when fed to fish.Figure 7: (A) The adsorption of Hg2+ by E. coli harboring the recombinant\u00a0plasmid.The results show that the MC exhibits its mercury binding characteristics when it is displayed on the surface.This indicated that the MC can bind mercury effectively.Compared with MT displayed on the cell surface, the binding efficiency of IC is higher than MT.(C) Fluorescence titration of IC (OD = 1.3) and Cu2+ (50 \u00b5M) following the addition of different concentrations of S2- (0-50 \u00b5M).The addition of Hg2+ (100 ?M) induced a significant decline in fluorescence emission of GFP-MC, which indicated that GFP-MC can be used as a sensor for Hg2+ detection.Furthermore, these engineered E. coli cells selectively adsorbed mercury ions from LB medium containing various heavy metals separately or mixed together.To verify the surface localization of the GFP-MC protein by cell fractionation, INP-N-GFP-MC in the membrane fraction was also demonstrated by western blotting.Thirteen different phyla were identified from the 6 samples.Excitation wavelength: 488 nm (D) Fluorescence titration of IC (OD) and Cu2+ (50 \u00b5M) following the addition of different concentrations of EDTA (0-20 \u00b5M).However, it can be seen that only Cd2+ increased the fluorescence of GFP-MC (Figure 6-A).The final concentration of the ions was 50 ?M.The black bars represent the addition of an excess of the appropriate metal ion (50 \u00b5M) to a bacterial solution.A total of 15,480 reads per sample and 1,306 OTUs were obtained from the 6 samples through Illumina Miseq system for sequencing.Good\u0092s coverage estimations revealed that 94% to 98% of the species were obtained in all of the samples.3-B), and the lowest detection limit was less than 1 \u00b5M.In comparison, engineered E. coli significantly protected fish from mercury toxicity.In comparison, engineered E. coli significantly protected fish from mercury toxicity.The principal coordinate analysis?PcoA?score plot revealed the bacterial communities of the samples.(B) Fluorescence responses of IC to Hg2+ at varying concentrations.Overall, the two PCoA axes explained 88.31% of the variation between the different communities.Although cells carrying pET23bNot were not fluorescent (Figure 2-B), cells carrying pET23b/INP-N-GFP-MC were brightly labeled fluorescent cells; Figure 2-A displays the fluorescence emission spectra of GFP-MC.", "safety": "To reduce the risks

silver medal criterion page for more about human practices.", "modeling": "We decided to treat the blood and bones of a contaminated person as two different systems to more accurately model how the body metabolizes lead and processes it.Unfortunately, this means that the child will continue to have prolonged exposure to lead at a very low level.With all the important information put into the model, we were able to begin simulating lead exposure.To examine the effect of severity of exposure over the same period of time, we ran simulations of a 100 day exposure to different levels of contamination range including 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppb.The results of these simulations are below It s clear that while the blood lead levels spike quickly, the body is able to filter the lead out of its system within 3 or 4 months after the initial exposure.This model provides a quantified approach relating the level and duration of lead exposure with the concentration of lead in the blood.You should note that as the duration of exposure increases, so does the variation in blood lead level, meaning that the severity for the same level of contamination will be more of a range than one distinct value.The Effect of Lead Contamination in Drinking Water on a Young Population  In developing a lead sensor for our project, we were curious about the effects of lead contamination in the water supply on small children.We were pretty appalled by the devastating effects lead can have on the human body and how long it can persist even after the initial exposure.Whether it is in estimating the severity of the events in Flint, Michigan or in detecting the threshold of exposure without noticeable side effects, this model could be the first step in better realizing how our bodies take up, store and slowly get rid of lead.With these literature values, we were able to create a rudimentary mass balance of the human body focusing on the amount of lead ingested and the amount that is excreted.The results of these simulations are shown below  Here we can see that even though the increase in lead in the bones is linear with time, the concentration of lead in the blood appears to begin reaching a saturation point.We began with a thorough examination of the literature, looking for important details on how much lead is absorbed into the body, where the absorbed lead goes, and how long it stays in the body.To account for the different amounts of water a child may drink in a given day, we ran the simulation 50 times and plotted them all on the same graph.Blood-lead levels do reach different levels of saturation but now we see that the rate at which lead is absorbed by the bones increases with contamination severity.Initially, we used a pulse of lead contamination of 50 ppb for 10 days on a 1-year-old child.This gave us a range of possible blood lead level concentrations based off of the level of lead contamination as we will see later.Determining the blood volume was a little tricky.We decided to look at the same level of exposure (50 ppb) but for increasing intervals of time (ranging from the initial 10 days and increasing to 25, 50 and 100 days of exposure.To get a better look at just the blood concentrations, below is a zoomed-in portion of the same graph just focussing on blood-lead levels for the first 200 days.As of yet there is no hard evidence that proves such a long exposure to lead at a low level can do any damage, there is a growing notion that an exposure like this at such a young age can make the individual at higher risk for depression and other neurological conditions.This is not true for the bones because the lead that makes it into the bones stays around much longer.We were able to find the average water consumed by a child based on their age in order to get an idea of their lead intake.This was meant to simulate a brief exposure to a mild amount of lead.We decided to model it using a 500 day window to see the long-term effects of lead exposure.", "notebook": "For a list of our protocols, visit the Protocols page.Test cell-free extract reaction with T7-GFP plasmidContact museums and summer programs for

for the Hairpin versus Duplex experiment above, the duplex and folded hairpin do not activate the toehold switch because the trigger is hybridized to the catalytic strand.Results from sequencing in Week 11 suggest that our completed construct contains CFP instead of amilCP, although the construct contains both the pT7-RBS and terminator.The final concentration of DNAzyme in the reactions is 3.74 nM, and the final concentration of lead is 2 \u00b5M.As shown below with data from Week 5, the plasmid triggers activate the toehold switch with as little as 10 ng of plasmid in a 25-?L reaction.However, a comparison by concentration of DNA instead of mass would be more accurate because the plasmid has much more \"extra\" DNA than the linear form.In Week 6, we ran cell-free reactions over a range of volumes.However, the duplex did not activate the toehold switch.We started working with the lead hairpin DNAzyme in Week 13.In Week 6, we found that the DNA trigger also activated the toehold switch at concentrations as low as 1 pM.In cell-free extract, the lead hairpin DNAzyme produces higher activation of the toehold switch than the duplex DNAzyme in a 1:1000 ratio.Below, the LacZ expression produced by the toehold switch activated by the hairpin DNAzyme cleavage product is compared to the LacZ expression in a system without lead.This could be a result of the excess catalytic strand interfering with the other processes occurring in the reaction.Although the dPAGE assays we performed in Weeks 7 to 10 do not provide clear information, the cell-free reactions suggest that the DNAzyme does cleave its substrate.Since we do not have a LacZ we can use, we have not started construction of this second part of the amplifier.The time course data shown below is more a function of evaporation than reaction progress; the liquid evaporated over the course of the run.We analyzed the efficiency of sequestration in Week 11.As shown in the figure below, there was still a signal with a reaction volume of 5 ?L.In addition, the triggers are switch-specific--the trigger for the D switch does not activate the G switch.However, after leaving them in the incubator overnight, the reactions darkened in color.For more details about our daily activities and experiments, visit our Notebook.In Week 8, we found that linear DNA does not perform better than plasmid DNA in PURExpress.The gel below suggests that all of the substrate strand is sequestered, but the thickness of the catalytic strand s band as the ratio increases could be blocking the signal from the

Comprehensive Evaluation of Antibiotics Emission and Fate in the River Basins of China: Source Analysis, Multimedia Modeling, and Linkage to Bacterial Resistance.Among all kinds of antibiotics, tetracycline is one of the most produced and used.One of the most serious damage tetracycline antibiotics have exerted on human beings is the tetracycline pigmentation teeth, which is rather prevalent in China.During the course of paper research, we found tetracycline antibiotics is one type of the most abundant antibiotics found in urban rivers, as illustrated in the table below [5].Occurrence and behavior of antibiotics in water and sediments from the Huangpu River, Shanghai, China.Our team is determined to work on the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics in our surroundings.The concentrations of the target antibiotics in (a) water samples and (b) sediment samples from the Huangpu River, Shanghai, China in July 2012 [5].Stunned by the large amount of antibiotic residues in Chinese urban rivers [4], UCAS iGEM team is devoted to degrading antibiotic residues in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) or hospitals.And that is why it is one of the most resistant antibiotics.Nowadays, tetracycline antibiotic residues mostly come from the overuse in animal husbandry and aquaculture industry.Tetracycline antibiotics are protein synthesis and cell growth inhibitors, inhibiting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex.However, the relatively low price of antibiotics has also led to its misuse, especially in developing countries like China.However, the mass production and misuse of antibiotics make them detectable in many places besides hospitals.In order to tackle the resistant bacteria, more antibiotic drugs should be taken so the resistant gene will be even stronger.Our survey indicates that people have misunderstandings on the correct use of antibiotics.Those tetracycline antibiotics not absorbed by animals will end up in soil and water, and eventually taken in by humans.Out-of-date antibiotic drugs are disposed randomly which is adding to the antibiotic residue pollution.[6] Tetracycline antibiotics can inhibit the development of children s teeth and bone growth, and are also easy to cause allergic reactions.High concentration of antibiotic residues in environment also encourages antibiotic resistance, since AR exposure is a form of \u0093underdose\u0094 as Fleming has mentioned.Chemosphere, 95, 604\u0096612 (2014)  [6] Tetracycline antibiotics - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics\"Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant\"\u00a0[1].Some cases of tetracycline pigmentation teeth have been speculated to have correlation with high concentration of tetracycline residues in drinking water.In China, about 147,000 tonnes of antibiotics are produced annually.However, the degrading super hero in the wrong place will be superbugs.Since penicillin was invented in 1928, antibiotics have been massively produced and have saved millions of people.", "design": "In our project, the engineered bacteria carry TetX, a natural antibiotic resistant gene.Mutagenic drift is particularly important for toxic proteins- or essential genes-based \u0091kill switches\u0092, for the selective pressure imposed on bacteria may lead to a dramatic alteration in the gene frequency.In the beginning, we put tetX gene directly under the control of pTet, a tetracycline-inducible promoter, so that the expression level of tetX will rise as the concentration of Tc goes up.Among them, Type II TA modules are the most extensively studied, so we decided to choose some of them to build and test our \u0091kill-switch\u0092.The gene coding T7 RNAP is placed downstream of pTet so that when the concentration of tetracycline increases, the amount of T7 RNAP will also increase to produce more tetX.Actually our goal is to apply our engineered bacteria to the degradation of as many as possible kinds of antibiotics which was theoretically feasible with different degradation enzyme and our system (details are shown below in \u0093Extension\u0094).Currently there are mainly three strategies to design a \u0091kill-switch\u0092: (1) Suicide system, where toxins or essential genes are commonly used to mediate cell death ;(2) Codon reassignment methods change the corresponding amino acid of a certain codon , like stop codon, and sometimes unnatural amino acids are assigned to that \u0091new\u0092 codon ; (3) Auxotroph is also commonly used.For this reason, the E.coli bearing the original circuit is called \u0091Scavenger\u0092, and the E.coli bearing the circuit with T7 RNAP is called \u0091Captain Scavenger\u0092.Genetically modified bacteria mainly pose threats to the environment through two ways: horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and bacteria escape.molecular oxygen (O2) is incorporated into verruculogen without O\u0096O bond scission, which lead to the oxidative transformations of substrate this Mononuclear non-haem iron enzymes catalyse a wide range of reactions Tet X:TetX monooxygenase catalyzes regioselective hydroxylation at carbon 11a of tetracyclines.It ought to be neutralized by its corresponding protein when, like in the waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), it is not expected to suppress the growth of bacteria.Structural basis for a new tetracycline resistance mechanism relying on the TetX monooxygenase.After literature survey, we eventually chose four kinds of oxidase which can be expressed in E.coli and hopefully have opportunities to degrade tetracycline: MnCcP, CPO?FtmOx1, tet X. CPO: catalytic oxidative degradation of sulfamethoxazole by CPO-H2O2 in the presence of chloridion.To further improve the performance of the scavenger, T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) and T7 promoter are introduced to raise the expression level of tetX.Whilst natural existing antibiotic resistant enzymes serve as a pool for finding the right ones, other enzymes with similar mechanisms also have the potential to degrade antibiotics at a high rate.The concentration of Tet remains high in the biochemical pools before water leaves it, so bacteria can grow normally in the pool.Secondly, the toxin must be toxic enough to kill the bacteria with a relatively low dose.To check the state of the scavengers, a fusion protein tetX-GFP (BBa_K2150013) combining tetX (BBa_K2150101) with GFP (BBa_E0040) is constructed to replace the role of tetX.To be more specific, auxotrophic genetically modified microorganisms (GMOs) rely on a kind of substance added into the working environment.These bacteria depend on an artificial molecule added to the working environment to survive.Nonetheless, if the artificial bacteria escape from the work environment, the concentration of Tet in surroundings drops dramatically.In order to transform an ordinary E.coli into a terrific scavenger who can eliminate tetracycline(Tc), tetX gene has to be imported to E.coli, enabling it to degrade Tc.This figure also illustrates our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design, see below.This figure also illustrates our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design, see below.After a series of primary lab experiments such as transformation, protein expression, purification of protein, enzyme assay and so on, we intended to accomplish the screening tests of all kinds of enzymes we have selected, as well as enzyme activity tests and kinetics tests for enzymes with high tetracycline degradation efficiency.Enzyme with the best degradation performance would stand out through our screening and would be applied to the construction of engineered bacteria, whose degradation effect in vivo would be tested in further experiments.As antitoxin degrades faster than toxin in the cell, it soon disassociates from toxin, leading to accumulation of free toxins within bacteria cell, which eventually result in cell death or arrest of growth.No matter what method is taken to build the \u0091kill-switch\u0092, a good one should meet some criteria, namely, to prevent mutagenic drift , environment supplement and HGT.Tigecycline Is Modified by the Flavin-Dependent Monooxygenase TetX.In the presence of T7 RNAP, T7 promoter is recognized and activated, leading to increased transcription of downstream gene.In solutions of pH greater than 1, the product 11a-hydroxytetracycline can decomposes rapidly and non-enzymatically into products that are not easily identifiable oxidative reaction of tetracycline catalyzed by TetX The monooxygenase reaction mechanism relies on the redox properties of FAD.However, this does not mean that the toxin is not controllable.While staying in the biochemical pool at WWTPs, antitoxin is induced by high concentration of Tet.TA modules are composed of a toxin molecule and an antitoxin molecule, and can be categorized into five types .We expected the circuit with T7 RNAP to perform better than the one without.In contrast, the expression of toxin will not be impaired in either condition.This fact is fundamental to our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design.Due to this high activity of T7 promoter, tetX protein can be produced in large quantity when tetX gene is expressed from T7 promoter.Without sufficient amount of Tet, the transcription of antitoxin is blocked by tetR.For those \u0091kill-switches\u0092 which make use of auxotrophies, environment supplement is a major challenge.CPO is considered to be the most versatile heme-containing enzyme, exhibiting peroxidase, catalase and cytochrome P450-like activities MnCcP : Crude MnP produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was used to degrade tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) in the presence of Mn2+ and H2O2 .MnCcP is a designed CcP with a Mn(II)-binding site by making Gly41Glu, Val45Glu, and His181Asp mutations, which can be expressed in procaryotic organisms.However, the real situation is much more complex than that.Since many of the oxidases require coenzymes or cofactors to function, they may have problems expressing in prokaryotic cells or for in vitro characterization.In this condition, TetX is also expressed and it oxidases Tet in vivo.Biochemistry.44, 11829-11835 (2005) [10] Gesa Volkers, Gottfried J. Palm, Manfred S. Weiss, Gerard D. Wright, Winfried Hinrichs.In our experiment design, we just took tetracycline degradation as an proof-of-concept.We designed a \u0091kill-switch\u0092 based on TA module.After reduction to FADH2 by NADPH, the isoalloxazine binds molecular oxygen to form a hydroperoxide.First of all, toxins and antitoxins should be readily expressed in E. coli, which is a basic requirement for genetic engineering in all circumstances.For example, a number of resistant proteins degrade antibiotics by oxidizing them, so other oxidases with similar or same coenzymes are highly likely to degrade antibiotics in similar ways.In order to build a good \u0091kill-switch\u0092, there are some major aspects we should consider.(2015) 539-543 [9] Ian F. Moore, Donald W. Hughes, and Gerard D. Wright.", "human_practice": "Although it is really difficult for a project in laboratory to meet criteria for commercialization, we were really inspired how synthetic biology can make people live better in the future.(d) Most people think it is OK to use artificial bacteria in WWTPs or hospitals to degrade AR as long as there is certain mechanism is deployed to make the system safe, which is exactly why we designed a double-function safe lock to prevent HGT and leakage at the same time.After the speech, we also talked with some investors from different countries, and learned that how government policy and support can influence their decisions, which is actually what synthetic biology lacks.That is also why we designed a double-function safe lock, preventing horizontal-gene-transfer and bacteria escape at the same time (see our Design part).During the poster session, we introduced to interested attendees the disasters antibiotic abuse may cause and tried to arise their awareness of careful usage of antibiotics (Fig.In our survey, we found that nearly 60% of all participants know the terminology and the mechanism underlies.In the morning on 4th SEP, we gave a presentation on our own project: the Ultra-sensitive Controllable Antibiotics Scavenger (Fig.55% of them believe that antibiotic residues can be found in sediments, and this proportion is the lowest among those chose surface/underground water and farm lands.This figure presents part of the results of our internet-based survey on antibiotic residues (AR).A surprisingly small number of people know the fact that antibiotics are widely found in drinking water, as indicated in the graph.As a new team taking part in iGEM for the first time, we benefited a lot from it.Mr. Schroeder is a Penn Alumni and is the only patent attorney on the industrial advisory board of SynBERC (the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center), a major U.S. research program to make biology easier to engineer.We explained our design and other work in detail, as well as introducing tremendous damages caused by antibiotic residues and our special design to solve this problem with the technique of SynBio.On the first weekend in September, we attended Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC).This indicates that even professionals know little about the scale and harm of antibiotic residues.Particularly, Mr. Schroeder also talked about how the iGEM competition has contributed to the development of synthetic biology and its industrialization.Our team sincerely wish more and more people, especially technical talents, can join the battle against antibiotic abuse with us, creating a safer and healthier future for the human beings.In general, the public underestimate the harm of antibiotic residues in environments and industrial products.China, as the world\u0092s biggest and the most fast-growing economy, is also catching up in scientific research.When questioned whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms(GMOs) in waste water treatment plants(WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory.We also designed several questions on antibiotic residues, which is directly linked to our project.Antibiotic abuse is one of the major causes for antibiotic resistance, and this has gained much awareness from the general public.In CCiC, we tried our best to make everyone realize the importance of dealing with antibiotic residues more or less.We designed a questionnaire and conducted an internet-based survey on antibiotic resistance, antibiotic residues and asked participants\u0092 opinions (especially safety concerns) on our project.At last, we asked people about security problems in our project.After presentation, we received a lot of attention from teachers and some other teams, further answering their questions about our project.From Mr. Schroeder\u0092s speech, we learned how synthetic biology could be applied to produce real products that are closely connected to environment protection, manufacture green material and so on.What is more, we also observed that biological majors did not outperform non-biological majors on antibiotic residues.People tend to believe that antibiotic residues widely exist in nature.(a) Most use antibiotics according doctor\u0092s prescription, but abuse in hospital is also a prominent problem.Most of them (at least 67%) know that antibiotics can be detected in meats (poultries, fish and cattle), but only 30% said they know antibiotics occur in drinking water, with merely 24% chose honey.", "modeling": "Since the quantity of substrate is limited in our experiments and the parameters should have clear physical meaning for further analysis, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model[5] as follows?

Dick, Mathematical Model For The Growth Of A Single Bacterial Cell, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1979, 326(326):35\u009652.The maximums of growth rate is slightly affected by the toxin of aTc, but it will do not change the discussion above.[2] Bruce R. Levin, Frank M. Stewart & Lin Chao, Resource-Limited Growth, Competition, And Predation: A Model And Experimental Studies With Bacteria And Bacteriophage, The American Naturalist.For any given ${gamma _P}$ , equation (23) can be fitted by multiple linear regression.The accurate solution of equation set (5) is not necessary because the expression of toxin only affect the terminal concentration of tetracycline degradation.Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.In addition, the growth rate curve of toxin 136 shows that the performance of antitoxin is not as good as others, thus we only focus on toxin 134,1204 and 6429.Accordingly, we can assume that the growth rate of total number of plasmids is equal to that of cells: Firstly, we discuss the solution of equation set (9) when ? is constant.At a concentration of around $0.8\text{ }!!~!!\text{ }!!mu!!\text{ g}/\text{ml}$ to $1..5\text{ }!!~!!\text{ }!!mu!!\text{ g}/\text{ml}$, a rough boundary can be seen, which confirmed that a switch effect occurs.The fitted values for parameters are shown in the table 1.From table 3, we can conclude that the corresponding antitoxin of toxin 6249 is most efficient.Then we assign ${gamma _P}$ point by point with a step of 0.000001 and find the best ${gamma _P}$ that maximize the linear coefficient.Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied.In the tetracycline uptake process of E.coli, two systems are involved: the rapid concentration-driven system which occurs initially and is insensitive to metabolic inhibitors, and the slow energy-driven system whose rate is only one-tenth of the rapid system[19].In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy, and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods, to show the influence of toxin and toxin-antitoxin coupling.For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.Can there be a model that fulfill the same functions as the traditional models, but with less parameters and with the least experiments?From the analysis mentioned above, we can conclude that toxin 6249 is most toxic and stable, its antitoxin is most efficient in neutralization as well.The example above clearly demonstrates the fact that, ODE model is sensitive to the values of parameters.Bacteria growth and protein expression are the most fundamental issues in synthetic biology.Therefore v(t) can be solved: Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density.Therefore, we employ ingenious tactics to build a practicable model of antibiotics degradation protein expression, bacteria growth under toxin-antitoxin coupling, and the overall circuit by in-depth analysis with least experiments.As is shown in figure 11, B(c) is low but not zeros when the concentration of tetracycline is zeros, this phenomenon indicates that leakage of promoter happens.Though it is still unknown whether the concentration-driven system can be categorized as passive diffusion or facilitated transport, the transportation rate is in proportion to the gradient of tetracycline concentration.The term 1 and term 4 of equation (12) take the vast majority of the sum of absolute values.5 Test result of the hypothesis for each type of bacteria in different concentration of aTc.We respectively measured the bacteria growth under different concentration of anhydrotetracycline(aTc), which induce the expression of toxin.On the contrary, bacteria are not influenced by the toxin inducer when antitoxins are expressed earlier.In mathematical form, the numerical relation is: So, we can assume that the existing toxin molecules are either in binding with target molecules, or in the toxin-antitoxin complex.[21] Goryachev A B, Toh D J, Lee T. Systems analysis of a quorum sensing network: Design constraints imposed by the functional requirements, network topology and kinetic constants[J].From another perspective, we can see that toxin 134 is inactivated before the antitoxin is induced by IPTG, which is because the leakage of antitoxin promoter or the instability of toxin.Dots are experimental values, and red curve is the fitted results.To make things worse, the ordinary differential equations are sensitive to parameters, and the errors will be amplified with time.Part 2 deals with the expression of tetracycline resistance protein, we use piecewise linear method for simplification, eigen decomposition method to extract the dominant sector.During the delay, antitoxin are synthesized and form binding with toxin.As long as the toxin is neutralized by its antitoxin, bacteria return to the normal state and grow as if in free conditions.Models usually relay on searching the parameters from previous works, but the values are measured under different conditions by different methods so the errors cannot be simply ignored.As expected, the shape and maximum are the same within error limits, and a delay can be clearly seen.The antitoxin is produced to neutralize toxin and the excessive part is degraded.Later, B(c) increase rapidly and reach its peak at around 2.5 mg/L, at which concentration the promoter is activated to the most.The form of the model is too complex, but the result shows that the replication period is converged to be synchronized with cell cycle.Our model minimizes the necessary experiments to get all necessary parameters, which is conducive to the industrial appliance and also propagable to modeling of other projects.It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions.Then the differential of tetracycline concentration within the cell caused by diffusion can be calculated directly.5, it can be convinced that the experimental group is the same as the control group under low aTc concentrations at the confidence of 90%, and distinct from control group under high aTc concentrations.Firstly, we add aTc in gradient concentration and excessive IPTG(8mmol/L) at the same initial time and measure their growth, as is shown in Fig.3 shows the growth of bacteria with toxin 1204 plasmid.The green curve is the mean value, and red area is the range mean value added and subtracted by the standard error.The bindings of first two processes are the limiting and rate-defining step.All of these substances can be degraded, therefore each has a degradation rate.It cannot be ignored because the lifetime of protein is rather stable that mRNA and peptide chain.Modeling is the art of description, estimation, prediction and optimization with limited knowledge and experimental data, which is exactly what we have to face.The demonstration above shows how to select an appropriate TA block with the mathematical model.[1] Liu, Y. Overview of some theoretical approaches for derivation of the Monod equation, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology.It can be expected that equilibrium sector and the degradation sector will still be the dominant ones when parameters are time-dependent.$G=Papp\times frac{A_{0}}{V_{0}}=0.67 s^{-1}$.We add a normal-distributed random relative error with a maximum of 5% to each of the 9 parameters in their model, which is far within the significant digit of these parameters.Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.Figure 9 is the calculation result, and the red area is the 70% confidence interval.The result shows that a much longer time is needed for bacteria to overcome the effect of toxin, if antitoxin is induced later than toxin.Since the bacteria in our experiments are of same species and are prepared by a same procedure, we regard the initial value of v as a constant in all these experiments.Therefore, a model with as many as 9 parameters collected from different sources are not only unnecessary but also unreliable.The reason for the delay is that, the way across the cytomembrane is different for aTc and IPTG.We fit the data with methods that mentioned previously, toquantify how parameters in growth function change with toxin.White blocks represent that the hypothesis cannot be rejected at the confidence of 90%, and colored blocks represent rejection at the same confidence.It takes the longest time for bacteria cells to overcome the effect of toxin 6249 after antitoxin is induced, therefore toxin 6249 is most toxic and also stable.In part 3 we integrate the two parts into a complete model, with which we do simulations to reach our conclusions.We study the effects of toxin alone on cell growth in our experiments.Bacteria with genes of aTc induced toxin 134, 136, 1204, 6249 and their corresponding IPTG induced antitoxin are prepared.OD600 (red)

degradation and procedural suicide genes obtained via screening, and many parameters are not available or not easy to search.Toxins may cause growth inhibition or death by targeting at DNA replication, mRNA stability, protein synthesis, cell-wall biosynthesis, and ATP synthesis [9].Thus, we only retain term 1 and term 4 in our equation.The latter is not as important as the former, hence we only consider the concentration-driven factors.8.Growth rate of bacteria with TA system induced by aTc and excessive IPTG at different time.To exemplify how error can be amplified, we would like to

collaboration, we measured the growth curve of E. coli harboring toxin MazF by 96-well microplate spectrophotometer for the iGEM team from Beijing Institute of Technology.During the summer, we worked hard to build our system, which consists of mainly three parts, and we got some quite promising results.We demonstrated that out of the four antitoxins cloned, three effectively neutralized their corresponding toxins.We cloned several potential antibiotic degrading enzymes, including TetX monoxygenase (TetX) and MnCcP, and successfully expressed and purified them.As a proof-of-concept, we showed that TetX can degrade Tet in vivo.We met with iGEMers from several universities including Peking University, Tianjin University, Beijing Institute of Technology, and Xiamen University, during which we discussed each other\u0092s projects and problems occurred in experiments.Besides collecting information from the public, we also get to the next generation.In previous years, dozens of teams have worked on tackling antibiotic resistant bacteria, while a small number of teams paid attention to degrading antibiotics, and few team showed solid data on how much antibiotic can be degraded in their projects.To measure the degrading rate, samples were taken for 30 minutes\u0092 interval, and the amount of remaining Tet were measured by LC-MS or UV absorption.We also attended this year\u0092s CCiC held during 2nd-4th Sept. at Sun Yet-Sen University in Guangzhou, where we lectured on our projects and took part in the poster session.They are also working on toxins to build a kill-switch, so our measurement can be quite important for them.We demonstrated that Mn(III) can also degrade Tet, providing a basic idea for future work.We successfully cloned 11 putative toxins onto

water channels in our hardware to inhibit the escape of our bacteria, and the bacteria in activated sludge can also be pumped back bio-pool.As long as antibiotics decrease to a low concentration, antitoxin expression will become less than toxin which leads to the death of our bacteria so that it won\u0092t be an antibiotic resistant superbug after accomplishing its mission.In our system, the degradation enzyme can only be expressed under high concentration of tetracycline antibiotics.In our questionnaire, we asked people about security problems in our project, for instance, whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory.That is also why we use a biocontainment strategy and prevent bacteria escape at the same time.So these degradation enzymes won\u0092t exert negative impact outside laboratory, and won\u0092t harm any plants, animals or human beings.We choose a non-pathogenic chassis, E.coli, and pay high attention to our project design, lab work, shipment, etc.Most of

part of the Decyclifier system is to degrade the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, into less toxic compounds using the degrading enzymes laccase and dioxygenase.It was uncertain whether the cells had the secretion system enzymes that would enable enzymes with a HlyA tag to be transported through the cell membranes.We chose a sensor that could react to salicylate when present; the production of our degrading enzymes would start in combination with a modified red fluorescent protein, dTomato, that indicates that there are PAHs present.The enzymes to convert naphthalene to salicylic acid is incorporated in a separate construct plasmid (you can read about this part of the project here).When attaching a signal sequence to a gene encoding an enzyme there can not be stop codons in between because the two genes need to be expressed together as one polypeptide chain.Two Nsil restriction sites were put before and after a 6xHis-tag so that the enzyme could be purified with an IMAC and so that the tag could be removed.It\u0092s a 60 amino acid long sequence attached to the C-terminal of our enzymes.This protein functions as a repressor at the other promoter in this construct, the Psal promoter.The end product in the extradiol degradation pathway is an aldehyde which is much more harmful to the cell than a carboxylic acid (Bugg, 1 September 2003).The laccase and dioxygenase gets translated and transported to extracellular space thanks to the HlyA-tag (See secretion system).Because of the copresence of naphthalene and other PAHs in the environment, this is a suitable system design.The end product in the intradiol degradation pathway is a carboxylic acid which is unharmful to the cell and can be used in the bacteria s metabolism.When these compounds are being degraded by the expressed laccase and dioxygenase we want to have an indication that our system is working; one that could easily be detected.The switch is connected to a fluorescent reporter gene which will indicate when PAHs are present and hence when the construct is active.Among the existing approaches for measuring the strength of a promoter, we chose to use fluorometry with the RFP dTomato as a reporter gene.We also want to include an on and off switch to the degradation pathway so that we do not stress the cells when the enzymes are not needed.This sequence is recognized by the Type 1 secretion system (BBa_K1166002) .The enzymes were purified and measured for activity using enzyme kinetics.The methods that we used for this part of the project, we thus chose to describe them on a separate page.When induced the expression of the red fluorescent protein, dTomato, starts and the degradation part of the construct gets expressed.We found one interesting repressor system known as the NahR-Psal-promoter which is a promoter that is induced by compounds similar to salicylic acid.This type of enzyme is used to catalyze cleavage of the aromatic rings in our degradation pathway.One of the main parts of our whole system is the visual response of PAH degradation.The gene is followed by a KpnI restriction site with glycines and serines on each side, which are small amino acids which increase the flexibility of the protein.We faced the need to characterize a promoter system inhibited by the NahR protein, which is induced by salicylate.One of the promoters, the Pr promoter regulates the upstream sequence of the construct, which also contains the coding sequence for the NahR protein.We decided to test the expression of the NahR/Psal promoter system with different salicylate concentrations.To assemble the HlyA-tag with the enzymes without getting a scar, two different methods were tried.This is needed for the export tag HlyA , to make it easier for the resulting signal protein to be folded properly.A second KpnI restriction site is put after the HlyA so that the export tag can be removed easily.This enables extracellular degradation of PAH and therefore protects the cells from the toxic PAHs and its metabolites.The aim was to attach the HlyA-tag to the biobricks encoding the two laccases CotA and CueO as well as to the catechol-1,2-dioxygenase.It has then two stop codons, and a terminator at the end.A previous iGEM team, Peking 2013, inspired us to use the NahR construct (BBa_J61051), a system consisting of two promoters and a protein coding sequence.When salicylate binds to the NahR protein, the conformational change it undergoes makes transcription of the sequence upstream the Psal promoter possible.Contrary to the Pr promoter, the Psal promoter regulates transcription of genes downstream of the construct.The choice fell on fluorescent reporter genes, since measurement and quantification of the expression would be easier and less time-consuming.Inferring from the crystal structure of the enzyme, both its C and N termini do not participate in critical interactions within the enzyme, which makes them suitable sites for export tag fusion.The mutation has been proved to have more efficiency to degrade ABTS than the unmodified one.We choose to work with D439A/M510L due to its efficiency and the supposed impact it would have on our constructs degradation time (Kataoka, K et al.This construct was intended to be compared with a construct without the secretion system to see if any of them had exported proteins.", "design": "As such the Decyclifier reactor will need to be emptied and the remaining sludge deposited as was previously done, however now no longer containing PAHs.For the Decyclifier reactor we purpose a simple batch-mode model, due to the lengthy process of the PAH degradation (approximately 10 weeks for a 100 m3 batch).We suggest that these two types of ash should be sludged with water and supplied to the Decyclifier bioreactor.Judging from our tests in the lab, the Decyclifier is capable of surviving high concentrations of pure napththalene and can thus be assumed to also be able to survive fairly high concentrations of PAHs in the toxic ash.With utilization of our biosurfactant system and the optimized activity of our modified Laccase, one might assume that the Decyclifier reactor should be able to reach at least the higher level of purification, possibly also in shorter amount of time.Through the process, two types of ash contain considerably higher concentrations of PAHs.Based on similar reactors the inoculating concentration of the Decyclifier in the reactor should be about 50 g/kg.Due to the relative toxicity provided through other components of the ash, it is important to remember that the remaining material still needs to be disposed of after the reactor run time has finished.This would of course be a key experiment for the future assessment of the Decyclifier system.A key issue however is the fact that ash contains many other toxic substances in addition to PAHs.Preferably this reactor should be run using similar conditions as the main reactor to make sure that the cells are indeed functioning properly.It is hard to asses the actual building and maintenance cost of the system without proper knowledge of local conditions.As of yet no tests regarding the cells viability in direct contact with the ash has been performed.As such it will be necessary to also include a smaller pilot reactor for growth of the inoculating culture prior to PAH degradation.1: Input 2: Termometer 3: pH electrode 4: O2 electrode 5: Rotor 6: Gas input 7: Gas output 8: Acid/base input 9: Cooling jackets 10:

simulations with the same settings.Figure 10: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.In figure 12 introduction method A with laccases and rhamnolipids introduced to system at time step 0 is compared to B, continuous supply of laccases and rhamnolipids to the system, 1 laccase and 0, 1 or 2 rhamnolipids added every 5 time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 9: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 12: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 11: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.Figure 8: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.To study whether the introduction method of laccases and rhamnolipids into the system affect degradation of PaHs, different variations of our model were constructed.Laccases and rhamnolipids were either introduced continuously to the system, at the same time as the BaPs or some time steps after BaPs are introduced in the system.BaPs, laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the model with random positioning and for every time step they move randomly.By modelling the effect of the rhamnolipids in our system in Java we aim to create a visual and analytical tool for the extracellular reactions of the system during various time spans and concentrations of PAHs, laccases and rhamnolipids.Settings: 100 Baps displayed as blue molecules, 20 Rhamnolipids displayed as black molecules, 20 Laccases displayed as red dots and the delay between time steps set to 30 ms.The Simbiology model of the whole system proved the rate limiting enzymes in our system to be 2-hydroxybenzalpyruvatealdolase and 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, both parts of the naphthalene degrading pathway.As expected BaP degrading rate is higher in the beginning of the simulation for model A because of higher concentration of laccases and rhamnolipids.Graphs were produced using the mean value of the number of BaPs in the system for every measured time step.The Simbiology model showed us the rate-limiting step of our system, whilst the Java model showed that the system will indeed be improved by the presence of rhamnolipids.Not surprisingly, the degradation rate is higher the more laccases is present in the system.Figure 10 shows that degradation of 100 BaP is faster in a smaller space (650x650 pixels) compared to in a larger space (1000x1000 pixels) when all other settings are the same, BaP/laccase ratio is 5 and rhamnolipid/BaP ratio is 0, 0.2 or 0.5.This in turn causes the induction of our main system which finally results in the degradation of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.Concentration of naphthalene decreases over time at a slightly higher rate than the formation rate of salicylate.The main model has the initial value of 5 moles of naphthalene and 50 moles of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.This model will allow the user to get an overview of the laccase/rhamnolipid/PAH - system and how it works in theory as well as collecting data about the degraded PAHs over time during different conditions.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 20 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids in a 650x650 pixels interaction area.The initial values for the remaining substrate related components of the system was set to zero.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 10, 20 or 50 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids in a 650x650 pixels interaction area.This enabled analysis of the system as a whole with a slight focus on two of the different parts of the system.As such, the model only serves as a theoretic representation of the actual in vivo system but should still follow a similar pattern.These parameters can be analyzed separately for each part, or for the system as a whole.Figure 2 shows how the concentrations/proportions between the different components vary over time in relation to its initial values.Figure 9 shows how the breakdown rate of BaP depends on laccase and rhamnolipid concentration.Rhamnolipids can attach to the BaPs, and BaPs can form aggregates with other BaPs.These values are strictly arbitrary and serve only to create an initial outlook as to how the system behaves.One main model where the Decyclifier\u0092s whole degrading system is represented, one where the naphthalene degrading pathway is represented and one where the salicylate-induced pathway is represented.BaP degradation rate for B is very low at the beginning because of low concentration of laccases and increases as the concentration of laccase increases.BaPs are less likely to form aggregates with other BaPs if rhamnolipids are attached to the BaPs.The model is a simple representation of our system with Rhamnolipids, BaPs and Laccases, where BaPs represent PAHs and Laccases represent both laccases and dioxygenases.Figure 4 shows the relationship between the different components of our naphthalene degrading pathway.The salicylate induced pathway has the initial value of 5 moles of salicylate and 50 moles of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.Moreover, we seek to prove that our concept is valid and gauge the efficiency of the system.In addition, the relationship in amount between the BaPs and the laccases have merely been estimated and the size ratio in our visual representation is completely unrealistic.Doing so saved us from having to deal with the convoluted differential equations that inevitably follow from a system as complex as ours.Another major difference is that in our model, degraded BaPs simply disappear, as opposed to turning into the degradation product.The naphthalene degrading model has the initial value of 5 moles of naphthalene.Due to the complexity of the real system, strictly arbitrary values regarding association, dissociation and breakdown of the respective components had to be decided.Laccases degrade BaPs with higher probability if they are not in aggregates due to the increased probability of the enzyme s active site to reach the BaP.In figures 8 to 12 we see the effect of varying rhamnolipid concentrations in the system.It is clear from figure 9 that the ratio of laccase/BaP causes a greater degradation rate effect of BaP than the ratio of rhamnolipid/BaP.The collected data can give us an insight as to what degree the rhamnolipids improves the action of the laccase, and also what ratios that give the optimal enzyme activity.By modelling our system in Simbiology we aim to obtain a further understanding of the parameters that rule the whole Decyclifier system.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.This is likely due to the increased probability of two molecules encountering each other in a smaller space.The amount of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene decreases as well while the amount of intermediate breakdown product and the dioxygenase product, here annotated as unknown product increases.This is mainly due to the fact that the laccase in reality is so much larger than the BaPs, which would make a visual representation very hard to interpret.Due to the fact that most of these reactions are catalyzed with a single substrate, this serves as a fair approximation.In some cases, the data pertaining to the enzyme with our substrate in Pseudomonas putida was not available, and we had to resort to using related values.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 20 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids.", "notebook": "The products were run on a gel and this showed that the PCR was unsuccessful.A transformation on the ligations with CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2 dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag gene were transformed but with no results.Large overnight on the

final enzymatic degradation construct by adding the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase after the modified laccase gene.We transformed our rhamnolipid construct in BL21D3 cells due to poor expression of mono-rhamnolipids in DH5?.Performed TLC test on the expressions from the rhamnolipid construct.Primers were designed for PCR extraction of the naphthalene upper pathway of the Nah7 plasmid from Pseudomonas putida, and to remove T7-promoters from CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase biobricks.rhlA and rhlB genes from the DNA distribution kit were transformed into E.coli DH5? and plasmid preparations were made.Transformations were done to insert biobricks with the enzymes CueO, CotA, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and the HlyA-tag genes into DH5?.We did the second PCR in the restriction free cloning with the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag gene.Since we didn\u0092t get any growth with CotA and HlyA-tag we decided to abandon the CotA enzyme.Ligation of the biobricks CueO and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with a standard promoter (BBa_J23110) were preformed.Performed digestion with KpnI restriction enzyme on the modified laccase sequence to remove the export HlyA-tag sequence.The products were loaded on a 2% gel and extracted to be used in the next step.We did a new 3A assembly with the correct HlyA-tag and our enzymes CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase.We also designed primers to do overlap extension PCR to remove the scar that was created when attaching the HlyA-tag with the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase genes.Stock solutions and agar plates with and without antibiotic resistance were made.Primers were designed for site directed mutagenesis to eliminate the restrictions sites for improving the NoKoGen biobricks, and primers were also designed for restriction free cloning to assemble the HlyA-tag with the CueO, CotA and dioxygenase genes, without creating a scar.It indicated presence of rhamnolipids.Analyzed differences in survivability between cells containing the naphthalene degrading pathway and negative control cells containing an RFP-coding gene by adding fixed amounts of naphthalene crystals in the lid of the agar plates.The RFC products with CueO containing the HlyA-tag and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag were sent for sequencing.Assembled dTomato construct at the end of our full rhamnolipid construct by 3A assembly.The CueO, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and the modified laccase genes was assembled with a secretion system.Phusion and Pfu was extracted from bacteria.Removed two PstI restriction sites from the naphthalene pathway through site-directed mutagenesis.The restriction free cloning for CueO and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase genes with the HlyA-tag was successfully executed.The first step in the restriction free cloning was done with the genes for the enzymes CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag.The CueO and the modified laccase genes were transformed into BL21DE3 cells.This as a preparation for building the biosurfactant construct.A first attempt to remove the T7-promoter from the biobricks with CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was done.Big overnights of BL21DE3 cells with catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, CueO and the modified laccase were made.Extraction and purification of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, CueO and the modified laccase.The rhamnolipid constructs was in pSB3K3, so they were transferred to pSB1C3 backbone as a biobrick requirement.The tested cells and its supernatants came from the transformation cultures of DH5? and BL21DE3 with promoters (BBa_J23101) and (BBa_J23110) as well as a DH5? with a simple RFP insert as a negative control.An anion-exchange chromatography was done to extract catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from cell lysate.touchdown protocol, gradients and adding DMSO was tried to remove the T7-promoter from the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase biobricks.Therefore the first PCR of the RFC was redone.The HlyA-tag was attached to the two laccases CueO and CotA that we had successfully removed the T7-promoter from with 3A assembly.The gel showed that the PCR had not worked.Since the NoKoGen biobricks had already been improved, transformation were done with the improved biobricks of rhlA, rhlB, and with RBS and the (BBa_J23101) promoter from the kit into DH5?.It was transformed into DH5? and the cultures were used for plasmid preparation to extract the DNA.Transformed our full construct with (BBa_J23101) promoter, RBS, rhlA and rhlB into DH5? cells.Frozen stock and plasmid preparations were made of these.Transformed the NahR construct, dTomato and super yellow fluorescent protein 2 (SYFP2), as well as plasmid prepared the transformed DNA and evaluated with PCR followed by further evaluation by agarose gel electrophoresis.Designed primers for sequencing of the Nah7 pathway, as well as primers flanking the entire pathway.The modified laccase gene without the export tag was also transformed into BL21DE3.Analysed the growth of our cells with the naphthalene degrading pathway with no naphthalene present, naphthalene present directly in cell culture and gaseous naphthalene presence.These pictures shows liquid culture containing naphthalene degrading pathway or red insert, where there is either no naphthalene present, naphthalene present directly in culture or gaseous naphthalene present.The reporter gene sequences and the modified laccase sequence were also assembled with two different Anderson promoters, (BBa_J23110) and (BBa_J23101).Grew

"design": "", "human_practice": "Secondly, we knew more supportive policies on the new environmental technology, and to know that the application of the genetic engineering in the disposal of pollution will not contradict the related laws gives us more confidence about our project.Overall, the heavy metal pollution of Chinese offshore cannot be overlook when we use seawater as material.In normal desalination process, even normal resource water has to go through some sedimentation processes.As to the opinion on the treatment of industrial polluted water, most respondents are unsatisfied and concerned about it since lots of problems still exist.In this part, we investigated the knowledge of heavy metal contamination and the knowledge of biological approaches dealing with heavy metals.So there is no need or trend to have the heavy metal pollution in a more detailed or specific legislation.In the second aspect, we questioned the supportive policies on new environmental technologies from the national and local government.Firstly, we obtained more legal knowledge about the pollution of heavy metals and water pollution, and thus we have a much clearer concept of the current legal situation in China.Many factories utilized the microorganisms to extract and purify precious heavy metal from the tailings.During the interview, Dr. Tang also asked us about the state of the metal that we retrieve as well as the adaptability of our bacteria.Also, there is a sum of considerable fund specifically supporting the circular economy from the government which we can take advantage of.In the third aspect, we demonstrated our concerns about the disadvantage of biological methods when dealing with the environmental pollution.Companies are optimistic about new technologies because not only are they beneficial for the company itself, the government encourages the development of new technology as well.In the end, Dr. Tang said that our project was aiming at a practical problem in our society and that we should improve the accuracy of heavy metal adsorption.And it offers an optimistic background to the development of new environmental technologies.In view of the fact that our project\u0092s target is pollution control and recycling, Mr. Wu gave us more advice on how to use policies and funds to support our project.We also propagated our project among the pupils and their parents to know about different opinions.After the activity, we interviewed the organizer of the environmental group and learned a lot about the environmental groups and development of sewage disposal in China.This also means that the factories can\u0092t avoid to deal with different pollutions in costal seawater, including heavy metal pollution.No doubt that it could be a promotion both for our project and the application of synthetic biology on environmental issues.On 4th August, we visited the BRUMP recycling technology corporation in Hunan Province.He explained that the heavy metal pollution is a cross-field pollution, so it can be cataloged into atmosphere, water or soil pollution so as to have a hierarchical supervision.Respondents reflect that the information is extremely limited and wish to learn more about heavy metal pollution.In a word, from the statistics above, both the resource and the number of respondents ensure that our survey is of convincing credit.There is a lack of useful and convincing information about the treatment of pollution.Therefore the first problem that we meet with is related to the living conditions of our chassis.In this concept, seawater desalination combing heavy-metal recycling will be the key to build the heavy metal\u0092s balance.The origin of heavy metal comes from the river, therefore, it is hard to control from the origin.Last but not least, we are inspired by the idea to expand our project to the disposal of soil pollution.During the visit, we interviewed with Dr. Tang, the adviser of the company about our project as well as the development of the sewage disposal enterprises.The advantage of our idea is that we only need to make sure that our engineered B. subtilis can survive in sea water while the low efficiency problem is also inevitable.Thirdly, we got information about the policies\u0092 support to industrialize our project.Furthermore, we will be dedicated to spread the scientific and objective attitude towards the transgenic technology to the people around in the future, since the more rebuttal there is, the clearer the truth becomes.2.NGO ( Non-governmental organization ): Leader of an environmental group in NanjingThere are many environmental groups which are devoted to environmental protection in Nanjing.Because of the serious pollution caused by heavy metals in these years, it is hard to make more detailed and revised laws in a short time, but the judicial interpretation has been able to greatly strengthen the enforcement of the standard.On the second problem about the further legislation, the attitude of Mr. Wu is negative.Nanjing-China team will explain the details which needs to be discussed to make this working for real.First, we start with the features of seawater and the end purpose of the combination project.Therefore, on July 3rd, 2015, we interviewed with the expert Mr. Cigang Yu, the research assistant from the research center for nature conservation and biodiversity, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People\u0092s Republic of China (NIES).Furthermore, he inspired us to use the biological methods to cope with soil pollution.At the end of the interview, Mr. Wu highly complimented our project and our in-depth thought on the law and policy issues of the project.In fact, one of the safety concern of general seawater desalination is what do we do with those sediments.Secondly, companies also pay a lot attention to whether the technology can cause pollution to the environment.He mentioned that these two problems are pivotal for the further development of our project.We have also shown to him our iGEM project as well as the iGEM competition.Also, the offshore is relatively big water body which makes the pollution hard to increase as well as decrease.The presenters in our team also got more familiar with the presentation.Therefore, it will benefit a large community if we help them participate in the iGEM competition.We also expressed our sincere appreciation for his patient answers and explanations.In conclusion, we did learn a lot from the interview.During the past two month, we have collected 498 samples.In addition, although the biological methods have the relatively low efficiency, it has more advantages such as the moderate condition and low-frequency of the second pollution.Unfortunately, the microorganisms used in our project were both chosen.The precious experience not only enlightened us about the design of our experiment, but also provided us with new ideas about synthetic biology.In his opinion, the genetic engineering project is only excluded by the agriculture, not the disposal of pollution.Therefore, we made contact with them and participated in the activity named \u0093Journey of Love\u0094 on July 26th, 2015.He wished that we could get a satisfying result in the final.One problem is that the regulations on the heavy metal pollution are vague with weak enforcement; another problem is about the necessity for the further legislation and regulation of the heavy metal pollution.As to the first problem, Mr. Wu told us that the current standard is actually a relatively early one, and the latest one is only a judicial interpretation.He also suggested that biological methods aren\u0092t the most prevalent yet except microbial methods.The interview clarified the attitude of Chinese government towards the transgenic technology, and helped us to have more in-depth understanding for the safety of GMOs, and to build up expectations for the future development of the transgenic technology.He also said that he was passionate about biological methods because there are inevitable disadvantages in chemical methods such as the high expenses, secondary pollution, low specificity and so on.We also consulted him about the aspects to which enterprises pay more attention because we wanted to improve the practical value of our project.Nevertheless, the technology also arouses widespread public criticisms in its legitimacy and morality.However, because it is plant, the study and application of mangrove will be relatively slow.Seawater desalination is one of the few seawater alternating technology that pumps in the seawater.On the one hand, the genetic engineering was what our project used, but we were not sure about whether the genetic modified bacterium we created would have some inhabitation from the government and the public.We also helped to show them how to use environmental detection device to test the concentration of pollutants in the river.Secondly, with the growing concern towards the pollution, the amendment and the government\u0092s implement of laws have been launched.Since that is the case, the transgenic technology is its basic methods inevitably.We put forward that the time of the policies\u0092 issuing is early and the incentive is not obvious, so is it necessary to have a further promotion of the policies?The key of transgenic technology is the transgene.The GMOs are now widely used in scientific research and are also applied in agriculture as the source of genetically modified food.Critics for GMOs, especially for the genetically modified food, claim that the risks of the food have not been adequately identified and managed, and they also question the objectivity of regulatory authorities.Firstly, the fund for environment technology comes from various sources such as the provincial research fund and Nanjing local government\u0092s investment.Among them, average lead concentration in the Bohai Sea is over the first seawater class, and some of the monitoring spot detect a number over the second seawater class.Besides, previous captains of Peking-iGEM and Tsinghua-iGEM were also invited to give speeches about the development of synthetic biology in China.The purpose of the interview was about the transgenic technology and GMOs.Also, there are concerns about the contamination of the non-genetically modified food supply from the genetically modified food.IT also brings some safety concern by introducing new species to original ecosystem.For example, the main recovery method focuses on mangrove in China.Thus, we should look at two projects\u0092 combination as environmental restoration and seawater alternation using the same artificial water flow.Back to circular economy, this will increase the force that heavy-metal waste change into resource with a low cost adding.The most important aspect is the manipulation of the technology.The introduction of a transgene has the potential to change the phenotype of an organism.All the 31 teams invited to the summit were invited to give presentations about their project.There are many technicians in the company who barely know about the principle of the technology.Many pupils were impressed by the pollution, exhorting them to no longer throw domestic garbage into the rivers.He believed that the support from the government is important but not indispensable because of two reasons.As to the age, respondents of 18-25 years old, such as university students, account for more than one-third of the total.The core of the concept is to maintain the balance between resource and waste.He told us that methods such as precipitation, resin adsorption, reverse osmosis and electrochemical methods are the most frequently used methods.Besides, they are very familiar with the conditions of the aquatic environment in Nanjing.We have been collaborating with each other since early July and the collaboration is still going on.Prof. Dai showed great interest in it and told us that he intended to organize their students to participate in the competition in 2016.In its report, the concentration of lead, copper, zinc and mercury in seawater which is over the first seawater class at some monitoring spots.The efficiency of absorption largely depends on the mobility of seawater.The summit was a rehearsal of the Jiant Jamboree in September.In China, this is one of the guiding ideology for the economic and society development.It shows that there are plentiful of ways but the Internet is the main information resource.Most of these criticisms are direct to the genetically modified organism (GMO), which refers to any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques.We have designed a questionnaire about the treatment of heavy-metal contaminated sewage both in English and Chinese and distributed it through the Internet.On the other hand, the efficiency of the biological method was relatively low, so we wanted to seek for more help at present.Mr.We come up with an idea of combining the two projects to achieve a win-win goal, which is to desalinate sea water with a high concentration of heavy metal.(For details about the institute, see \u0093Brief introduction of NIES\u0094 He is researching on the biosafety of GMOs.So we decided to do some tests to confirm whether they can survive simultaneously in sea water with heavy metal.Therefore, we believe more information should be spread widely in this part.In the meanwhile, most respondents don not know about biological approaches dealing with heavy metals.Sea water with high concentration of heavy metal go through our purification device first so that heavy metal contaminants can be adsorbed.We volunteered to take approximately 50 pupils to the polluted river called the Hong Hua River.That is to say, this survey covers mainly university students and intellectuals who have enough social experiences and are easily influenced by new-born stuffs.When surveying about public awareness of sewage treatment, most respondents (98%) pay attention to such sort of news in daily life, which illustrates high attention paid to water pollution.The idea of cooperating two project is to merge Nanjing-China team\u0092s project to achieve a new seawater recovery and utilizing system.The word \u0093circular economy\u0094 should be familiar to most people.The prospect of our project will be better as long as we keep polishing the details of it.On 14th-15th August, our team was invited by Peking University to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee).", "modeling": "Using matlab, we can solve technical computing problems much faster.Matlab has a wide range of applications, including signal and image processing, communications, control design, test and measurement, financial modeling and analysis, and computational biology.In our modeling, we use matlab to find out the influences imposed on protein expression by certain parameters, such as pH, ion concentration, etc.Our project uses Bacillus subtilis as the bioreactor to deal with heavy metals: Au, Pb and U.In the first part, we worked out growth curves of B. subtilis\u0091s vegetative state and spore state, using Logistic model.In the third part, we used GolB-Au as an example to shed light on the optimal concentration of metal ions and the time for binding proteins\u0092 saturation.Through modeling, we know B. subtilis better and find optimal experimental conditions.Therefore, optimal PH for growth is 7.0.Combining the experimental data with modelling, we found that sucrose is the best carbon resource for the high growth rate and maximum cell number.Combining the experimental data with modelling, we found that using corn flour as the nitrogen resource contributes to a high growth rate of bacillus subtilis, while yeast cream yields to the maximum in cell number.In the modeling part, we have built three models: Growth, Transcription-Translation and Bioabsorption.Besides, we can also find out whether our wet lab results conform to the modeling results.Considering the fact that proliferation is unhindered when resources are sufficient and minimal when resources have run out, our model couples growth (N) with resources (R).According to the results of modeling, you may predict what would happen under different conditions.Modeling also takes different forms, and the following is some examples of models:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This model is used widely.Modeling aims to build and use a model which provides a theoretical way to explain a phenomenon in a simpler fashion than the real situation.According to the previous research, PH and the resources play crucial roles on the growth of bacillus subtilis.In the second part, we compared the efficiency of three different promoters we use: Pveg, Ptas and Pcot and try to find which one has the highest efficiency.In spore state, bacillus subtilis is dormant and with strong resistance to the unfavorable conditions.[reference1] Referred to Logistic model, here are our equations.The experiment data shows that the number growth rate increases with PH increase when PH is lower than 7.0, but decreases with PH increase (>7.0).However, modeling plays an increasingly vital role in the research of synthetic biology.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "As we have mentioned above, we need to construct 16 kits, which proved to be successful.(Figure 1)During the experiment, we utilized a constitutive promoter Pveg, a biobrick part coding for eGFP and two terminators.", "safety": "Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created.These have caused a lot of excitement in the pharmaceutical industry as they will be cheaper to produce, allow quicker production, as well enhance the knowledge of virology and immunology.The organisms we are dealing with are B. subtilis 168, B. subtilis NCIB3610 and E. coli K12.High security facilities are necessary when working with Synthetic Biology as there are possibilities of bioterrorism acts or release of harmful chemicals and or organisms into the environment.These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow.B. subtilis is the most studied gram-positive bacterium and a model organism in studying chromosome replication and cell differentiation.Synthetic vaccines are now being produced in the lab.So we plan to design an airtight container and totally enclosed process to control the engineered bacteria to escape into the environment.As for the experiments, the experiments are mainly in the molecular level, so the risks are caused by the reagents we used.With the potential future creation of man-made unicellular organisms, some are beginning to consider the effect that these organisms will have on biomass already present.Scientists estimate that within the next few decades, organism design will be sophisticated enough to accomplish tasks such as creating biofuels and lowering the levels of harmful substances in the atmosphere.For example, FDA stated that enzymes derived from it were in common use in food and that nontoxic and nonpathogenic strains of B. subtilis have been used in a variety of food applications.They also argue that the development of these organisms will simply shift the consumption of petroleum to the utilization of biomass in order to create energy.Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health.These organisms can harm existing life by affecting the prey/predator food chain, reproduction between species, as well as competition against other species (species at risk, or act as an invasive species).E. coli is the most studied and utilized bacteria in synthetic biology.However, the engineered bacteria may be released into the real world.B. subtilis and substances derived from it have been evaluated by different authorities about their safe and beneficial use in food.After collecting and sterilizing, the bio- or chemical wastes will be recycled by professional chemical recycling staffs in our institute respectively.A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.During our research, we carried out experiments within the biosafety guidelines established by WHO.", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite": "BBa_K1701004",

Mississippi River; Signs of Progress in the Illinois River.In the following century, agricultural production exploded and global population soared from 2 to 7 billion people.However, such demand for nitrate fertilizers has taken a toll on the environment.Additionally, we improved the characterization a Heat Shock Promoter (HSP) BioBrick that is supposedly activated at high temperatures but had no

fertilizers were difficult to manufacture on an industrial scale.", "design": "From our literature reading, we identified three genes that we believed would help us overproduce intracellular ATP and two genes to overproduce reduced electron donors.The three ATP-producing genes were pck, pgk, and the ATP synthase multi-gene operonpck: Codes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK), a kinase involved in gluconeogenesis that decarboxylates oxaloacetate (OAA) into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and creates ATP in the processpgk: Codes for Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), a kinase involved in glycolysis that converts 1,3-Biphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate by removing a phosphate group and creates ATP in the processThe ATP synthase operon (genes atpA - atpH): These genes code for their respective subunits of ATP synthase, a multi-protein complex that works to produce ATP when on a proton gradient.pBad: a promoter that is induced by the presence of arabinose (Ara) was used for the ATP plasmidspTet: a promoter that is induced by the presence of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) was used for the electron donor plasmidsAdditionally, for each of the electron donor genes (fldA and petF), we created a version of the plasmid with and without pfo (4 plasmids total)We used golden gate assembly to construct the plasmids, with BsaI as the Type IIS restriction enzyme.In order to accomplish this goal, we partitioned the project into three phases:Project Design: Identifying genes of interest (GOI), constructing plasmids, and conducting further modeling (Flux Balance Analysis)Experiments: Transforming the plasmids into DH10B (wild-type E. coli) and measuring for our gene products Proof of concept: Demonstrate the functionality of the plasmids We began by exploring the literature and academic papers on this topic.Unfortunately, ATP synthase was later dropped due to size constraints in cloning.We believed that overexpressing genes that transcribe ATP-producing enzymes would lead to a cell with more intracellular ATP.fldA: Codes for flavodoxin, an electron-transfer protein native to E. colipetF: Codes for ferredoxin, an electron-transfer protein native to SynechocystisE.Our team set out to design an E. coli strain that overproduced ATP and electron donors in order to create a suitable environment for nitrogenase activity, as well as increasing the activity of other cellular functions requiring ATP or reduced electron donors.We wanted to see if ferredoxin could be produced in E. coli and how it would perform relative to the naturally occurring flavodoxin at various levels of expression.We extracted fldA from E. coli MG1655 and petF from Synechocystis 6803.We believed that overexpression of these genes would lead to more reduced electron-transfer proteins available for various cellular uses.In addition to fldA and petF, we also identified pfo as a metabolically relevant.Check out our modeling page to learn why we decided to use this gene and the process of modeling of our Super Cells.Each group of plasmids had a different inducible promoter so we could fine tune the expression of our GOIs to make sure the cell was not

detail:The history of WashU-PSU iGEM teams and the Nitrogen ProjectOur conversation with Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa, who argued that synthetic biology could not end nitrate runoffOur interview of Ray Erhardt, an aquatics engineer, who thought that nitrate runoff must be dealt upstream of wastewater plants and in the fields themselvesWe spoke with members of the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board and the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, who both believed other, natural solutions to excessive fertilizer use could be more effective than synthetic biologyWe interacted with scientists and researchers at Monsanto and Intrexon who suggested new approaches to our project and backed our research and missionOur time spent interacting with future STEM students and high school teachers at Wash U and Missouri S&T and teaching them about synthetic biologyFor the past two years, the WashU-PSU iGEM team has been working to progress the Nitrogen Project.We thought that a cell with the perfect conditions for nitrogenase could also be used with other recombinant proteins \u0096 we\u0092d just have to select the right conditions to improve.While our new project still fit into the scope of the Nitrogen Project and we continued to understand the impact of nitrate runoff in the agricultural regions around St. Louis, we also began to consider other applications of our research.Nitrates leak from the soil regardless of fertilizer use and, instead, we should work to plant cover crops to soak up the excess.This had a very strong impact on our direction for the project.While we were still motivated to work on the Nitrogen Project, our scope was now adjusted.As a subsidiary of the Nitrogen Project, a multi-university initiative to end nitrate pollution, our focus for human practices was largely based on agriculture.While we were still motivated by this original application of our research, we began to seek out new venues for its use.Finally, we sought out advisors who could comment on the use of our supercells beyond an agricultural setting.While a GMO may be useful, they thought it wasn\u0092t the only option, and certainly not the most effective.Next, we reached out to the Missouri Coalition for the Environment.So we tried to carve out a new niche in the Nitrogen Project for ourselves \u0096 and we looked outside Wash U for help.Enter Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa.While our lab was not equipped for the method he suggested, we were inspired to use our spectrometer to get a rudimentary idea of ferredoxin and flavodoxin concentrations.Intrexon, another sponsor of the WashU-PSU iGEM team, allowed us to speak with one of their lead microbiologists.If nitrogen-fixing plants won\u0092t have the world-changing impacts we believe, were there other problems we could tackle with research that fit within the bounds of the nitrogen project?What other applications weren\u0092t we considering?After our conversation with Carlson, we took a closer look at the cellular conditions necessary for nitrogenase function.Initially, we called her to get a better idea of the environmental consequences of nitrate fertilizer runoff in the Midwest.We contacted companies that use synthetic biology for more industrial purposes, and asked them to comment on how our \u0093supercharged\u0094 cells could be practically utilized.To begin our education on nitrate runoff, we began with faculty within WashU in St. Louis.Mr. Erhardt had several contacts in the St. Louis area, and suggested we reach out to other regional authorities.We contacted the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board, the governing body encouraging sustainable farming practices in our area.However, we didn\u0092t want to abandon their work and shirk the resources and knowledge of the professors and graduate students who we would be working alongside all summer.At first, we requested time with Ray Ehrhardt, a professional engineer with a position in the department of Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering.From this experience, we learned that the runoff crisis stretches further than simply a dearth of new agricultural technologies.This summer program allows a group of approximately 30 students to do an experiment in each of the engineering school\u0092s main divisions.We discussed our project with local teachers participating in a BioBuilder workshop.They invited us to one of their monthly board meetings, where they commented on the usefulness of our project.Most farms in the midwest are privately owned and operated they said, and it is entirely possible to get these farmers to adopt practices that they believe can mitigate runoff.As for the runoff that does occur from plants, the popularized notion of \u0093industrial farms\u0094 spraying millions of gallons of fertilizer isn\u0092t necessarily true.We explained that the Nitrogen Project aimed to eliminate fertilizer use altogether.From his advice, we recognized that our strain had varied applications in industry as well as agriculture.Throughout the course of our project, we sought to apply our knowledge of synthetic biology through education wherever possible:We led two synthetic biology workshops for Washington University\u0092s pre-engineering institute.We found that the teachers were enthusiastic about including synthetic biology in their curriculums.We helped run a \u0093Building with Biology\u0094 event at the iGEM heartland regional meetup with our buddies over at UNL and Missouri S&T.One suggestion was that our cells could output ATP in a reactor for other cells\u0092 use.Opposed to GMOs, they advocated for other sustainable methods of providing fertilizers to crops \u0096 most poignantly, the unused resource of livestock manure that is plentiful in the midwest.In a way, our cells could act as a source of fuel for ATP-intensive processes in other cells.In our first group meetings, we had to determine if we, too, wanted to contribute.The crux of excess nitrate runoff isn\u0092t agriculture, they said.In future work, we think a cytochrome assay could prove more indicative of reduced electron donor concentration than a biotin assay.", "modeling": "When the wild type 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA reaction was knocked out and replaced with the ferredoxin equivalent reaction, wild type biomass was retained but there was no ferredoxin production.When the objective reaction is biomass production, FBA can be used to predict growth rate at different conditions.The figure above shows FBA as a pipeline.Thus, the pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction was replaced with the ferredoxin equivalent to achieve ferredoxin production.When running FBA, the biotin synthesis reaction carried flux, indicating that under the specified conditions, reduced ferredoxin was being produced.Unlike electron donor modeling, we did not have time to test these modeling predictions in the lab.Ferredoxin yield can be estimated by the ratio of biotin to ferredoxin flux.In order to determine the best possible source, we identified two reactions, knocked those out, and replaced them with equivalent reactions that used ferredoxin as an electron carrier.Biomass production can be achieved through various reactions (Product A, B, and C) and knocking out a reaction (closing a valve) forces the organism to obtain biomass through a specified reaction.aceE codes for a subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), a key enzyme in the pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction.Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is used to predict possible flux distributions that achieve optimal flux through the objective reaction.Flux was minimized over the subset of metabolic reactions that produced ATP and possible knockouts were identified by identifying the reactions that had minimums significantly higher than wild type.In doing this, there could not be negative fluxes when minimizing the flux values (a negative value means the reaction is in the reverse direction) so reversible reactions were split.These discoveries lead to two key wet lab approaches:The pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction was knocked out by obtaining a knockout strain for aceE.In the lab, we constructed new electron donor plasmids that had pfo overexpressed along with the electron donor genes.ATP could be further maximized by ensuring higher minimum ATP flux levels.Replacing the original pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reactions allowed for ferredoxin production, but there was less biomass production than wild type.By knocking it out, we were able to knock out the reaction.We modeled its overexpression, which predicts that there should be an increase in the production of reduced electron donors.The binary reactions were then added to the model to ensure that all flux ranges were positive.This ?aceE strain was then used in conjunction with our electron donor plasmids to further increase reduced electron donor productionWe were able to replace the PDH reaction by overexpressing pfo.", "notebook": "ATP

"During our literature mining, we found two distinct molecules that are reported to bind methamphetamine with different affinities; Anti-METH scFv antibody [1]; which composed of two parts, we named them as C1 and C2 Alpha-synuclein[2]; a truncated model of alpha synuclein that includes amino acids 1-60 used Starting with these biological sensor parts, our strategy then based on FRET (Forster Resonance Energy Transfer) technique, which can be simply described as the energy transfer from one excited, fluorescent molecule that results as an emission from the other fluorescent molecule, which is not excited directly by light source but emit energy from the adjacent fluorescent molecule s emission.After their discovery, especially the whole-cell biosensors became a widely used tool for synthetic biology, and manipulated to detect different signals from the environment including nanoparticle toxicity and cancer.Biosensors are the biological systems that are known to their property of sensing different substances and report their existence in digital (On/Off) or analog (input range) fashion.Our constructs formed as shown as the PDB images below; After designing our biosensors, their initial analyses made by molecular dynamics simulations (shown in Molecular Dynamics section of the web site) and their production made by using commercial pET28-(a) expression plasmid and gene parts provided by IDT sponsorship.", "design": "As a last step at CHARMM-GUI server, download simulation files from download .tgz link, exlude from the .tgz file and upload charm-gui folder to the necessary folder at your supercomputer inside a folder that is named for your job (ex: your_job).In our case, MD uses Newtonian mechanics to describe the molecular system through empirical calculations of the potential energy (Leach, 2001).CHARMM GUI: An online web-site interfaced database that helps to generate simulation files Loop.tmp: parameters will be applied for each cycle *There are also some corrections that needs to be done in the CHARMM-GUI files 1.Choose your crystal structure from the literature (PDB is a very useful database for that job).As a result, MM approach on protein systems allows us not just only discover conformations of the proteins, but also their dynamics (Frenkel and Smit, 2002).In equillibration, the molecular system is first energy minimized, then gradually heated up to the target temperature of the simulation, and then equilibrated.In this study NAMD molecular dynamics package used throughout these stages of the simulations.As a final adjustment, go to the step4_equillibration.inp and step5_production.inp files at ../charm-gui/namd file, open these two and deleted the line Then, go to the ../charm-gui folder, copy checkfft.str file from there and paste to the ../your_job/charm-gui/namd *We use that step to by-pass python execution since its type may change from different computers 14.These may have considered as the standards of MD simulation with CHARMM force field and NAMD software.This potential is used to compute the force felt by each of the atoms in the simulation, which is totally known as the force field.In particular, VMD can act as a graphical front end for an external MD program by displaying and animating a molecule that is undergoing simulation on a remote computer.How to MD with UHEM or TRUBA Supercomputers of Turkey PDB: Protein Data Base file type, your protein structure presented here.CHARMM force field interpretes energy as the sum of bonded and non-bonded terms as illustrated in the equation below.The positions and charges are then used to calculate a potential energy for the system.Molecular Dynamics is the technique of using classical mechanics or quantum mechanics to represent a system and that is using to study as time-dependent, kinetic models of the system for different kinetic and thermodynamic analyses.Overall, energy function and the calculation of individual forces can be formulated as given below (Note that calculation of energy function will be stated in next sub topic) where U is total energy of the system, Fi is the force applied on each atom (i is the atom number), and mi.With the increasing complexity and recent advances, MD has become a part of supercomputer area, and different computer experiments related with biology also done by using that immense machines and complex algorithms.The potential energy of a molecular system is evaluated through few relatively simple mathematical terms accounting for covalent bonded interactions (including bond, bond angle, and torsional terms) and nonbonded interactions (including long-range Coulombic and Van der Waals (VdW) terms).NAMD uses the popular molecular graphics program VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) for simulation setup and trajectory analysis, but is also file-compatible with other popular force fields including AMBER, CHARMM, and X-PLOR.The van Der Waals (VdW) energy is calculated with a standard 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential and the electrostatic energy with a Coulombic potential.By using Newton\u0092s laws of motion over a short time step with the obtained individual forces, a new set of positions and velocities is produced for each of the atoms.VMD can also be used to animate and analyze the trajectory of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.The Urey-Bradley component (cross-term accounting for angle bending using 1,3 nonbonded interactions) comprises the fifth term, where k_u is the respective force constant and u is the distance between the 1,3 atoms in the harmonic potential.Where bonds term in the energy function accounts for the bond stretches where kb is the bond force constant and b-b0 is the distance from equilibrium that the atom has moved, angles term in the equation accounts for the bond angles where k_? is the angle force constant and ?-?_0 is the angle from equilibrium between 3 bonded atoms, dihedrals term is for the dihedrals (a.k.a.Once we are convinced with the designs (proper plasmid and restriction site selections) we performed on Benchling, we ordered our DNA fragments in the extent of IDT\u0092s sponsorship.We used Escherichia coli (E. coli) DH5alpha strain for cloning purposes and E. coli Shuffle T7 express cells for protein production host.We used pET28a(+) vector for both cloning and expression of the parts we used in this project.Go to the http://www.charmm-gui.org/ , choose INPUT GENERATOR from the left menu, and then, choose the QUICK MD SIMULATOR from again the same menu.The updated values can now be fed back into the first step of the calculation, to update the position of each atom according to classical mechanics, and the process repeated for creating a trajectory of atomic locations and velocities through time.where the Lennard-Jones potential is zero) (Vanommeslaeghe et al, 2010).First, we prepared a flowchart of our experimental procedures as shown in the figure below.The equilibration phase is usually a multi-step process, in which the heavy atoms in proteins are first heavily restrained and gradually released until the system is completely unrestrained and stable.In this methodology, atoms of the system modelled as points with given mass and charge with pre-assigned coordinates of different atoms.the radius of individual atoms and the optimal bondlengths, are referred as the force field.Nonbonded interactions between pairs of atoms (i, j) are represented by the last two terms.In this study, we use CHARMM22 force field to operate molecular dynamics simulations (Brooks et al., 1983).Upload run.job, loop.tmp, loopnumber.txt, and colvars.in to the ../your_job/charm-gui/namd folder 12.(d2ri / dt2) part of the equation is the mass multiplied by acceleration (m.a) part of the classical Newton\u0092s law of motion formula shown below.It may also be used to view more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the contained structure.Make sure it is intact (all amino acids on sequence presented at PDB file) and have a preferable resolution (below 2.5 Angstrom).In the Lennard-Jones potential above, Rmin term is not the minimum of the potential, but rather where the Lennard-Jones potential crosses the x-axis (i.e.By definition, the nonbonded forces are only applied to atom pairs separated by at least three bonds.Based on Charm++ parallel objects, NAMD scales the necessary calculations to hundreds of cores for typical simulations and beyond 500,000 cores for the largest simulations.torsion angles) where k_? is the dihedral force constant, n is the multiplicity of the function, ? is the dihedral angle and ? is the phase shift, the term improper accounts for the impropers, that is out of plane bending, where k_? is the force constant and ?-?_0 is the out of plane angle.The protein structure (a crystal structure, NMR structure or a homology model) is usually not present in its natural environment, and some preparation is therefore necessary.The setup stage involves insertion of water molecules, for example determined by grid calculations (Farantos et al., 2005) into the protein structure and soaking the protein membrane complex into a box of water with included ions.", "human_practice": "We first explained what synthetic biology is and then we talked about what people can do with the use

we encouraged them about joining to the competition for iGEM high school category.After we explained, discussed and answered their questions about synthetic biology, thirdly we talked about what is iGEM and what are we doing for this competition.For years, human practise is a very important component of the iGEM competition and we know the importance of the human practise leg of this multi-segment competition.Here you might see our petition that we gave to the Chief Prosecutor of Istanbul that is written in Turkish and about our demand from captured illegal drug samples for

"modeling": "Finally, we can get the unstable diffusion differential equation while the enzymes near the cells are secreted along direction r.$$frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} = Dfrac{1}{{{r^2}}}frac{partial }{{partial r}}({r^2}frac{{partial E}}{{partial r}}) + {r_E}$$Integrate the equation above then we can get the distribution equation of the enzyme concentration.If we use the diffusion rate equation, the rate of enzyme diffusion from cells to liquid phase body can be described as:[frac{{d{E_x}}}{{dt}} = {k_c}{a_c}({E_c} - {E_x})]Mass transfer process of enzymes from liquid phase to the surface of PETSimilar to the process of diffusion from cells to liquid body, based on Fick\u0092s first law and mass conservation we can get the differential equation of the diffusion process.$$frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} = D(frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {x^2}}} + frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {y^2}}} + frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {z^2}}}) + {r_E}$$If we integrate the formula above, we can get the distributing equation of the enzyme concentration.Similarly with the diffusion rate equation, the equation of the rate of enzyme diffusion from liquid to PET surface can be obtained:$$frac{{d{E_p}}}{{dt}} = {k_p}{a_p}({E_x} - {E_p})$$The total diffusion equation of the process can be described as:$$frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = Ka({E_c} - {E_p} - Delta E)$$The loss of driving force of mass transfer caused by the enzyme concentration accumulation in the liquid phase.Assuming that the diffusion process in liquid phase is a dynamic balancing process, which means the concentration variation in the liquid phase body is equal to the rate of enzyme production, it can be describe as:$$frac{{d{E_c}}}{{dt}} - {r_E} = frac{{d{E_P}}}{{dt}}$$[frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = frac{{({E_c} - {E_x}) - frac{{{r_E}}}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + ({E_x} - {E_p})}}{{frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + frac{1}{{{k_p}{a_p}}}}}]So the relationship between the parameters in total mass flux equation and those in interphase mass flux equation is:$$frac{1}{{Ka}} = frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + frac{1}{{{k_p}{a_p}}}$$As we can see, the total resistance for enzymes in liquid phase is the resistance from cell surface to liquid phase body plus that from liquid to PET surface.As a result, the most of the resistance for enzyme transfer in liquid phase is that from liquid to PET surface, which can be described as:[frac{1}{{Ka}} = frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}};;;;;K approx frac{{{k_c}{a_c}}}{a}]After secreted by cells, enzymes diffuse to the surface of PET through liquid phase.In the process of mass tranfer, enzyme concentration in liquid phase will be balanced with that on the surface of cells and that on the surface of PET.Thus some enzymes will remain in liquid phase body.And the mass transfer process will lead to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface.This can be expressed by the equation below: [int_t^{t + T} {Ka({E_c} - {E_P} - Delta E)dt = {E_c} - {E_P}} ] The equation above is an integral equation.Corresponding differential equation is:[Ka[frac{{dT}}{{dt}}Delta E(t + T) - Delta E(t)] = frac{{Delta E(t)}}{{dt}}]Intergrate this equation and we get the relation between delay time T and time:The process of PETase adsorbing on PET surface and enzymes catalyzing PET degradationThe biodegradation of polymer by enzymes is a kind of heterogeneous enzymatic reactions.So the rate of degradation of polymer, the absorbed enzyme amount, the inactive combined enzyme mount, the density of ester bond on polymer surface and the superficial area have the following relation:[v = - frac{{d{n_{exp }}}}{{dt}} = A cdot {k_2} cdot {\rho _{EB}}({q_E}A - {n_E})]Connecting with the absorption balance and the substrate restrain balance, we can get the total rate of degradation equation:[v = {k_2}{\rho _{EB}}(frac{{{K_A}[E]{q_{{E_{max }}}}A}}{{1 + {K_A}[E]}} - {K_A}{K_B}{[E]^2}[P] cdot V)][[E] = frac{{[{E_P}]}}{{1 + {K_A} + {K_A}{K_B}[P]}}]The concentration of enzymes on the plastic surfaceBecause the concentration of enzyme is low in the system and the producing rate of MHET is equal to the rate of PET degradation, we can get the following formula:[, - frac{{d{n_{exp }}}}{{dt}} = frac{{Vd[P]}}{{dt}}]Considering that MHET in substrate restrain is easy to diffuse to liquid, which means the balance is small, we can get the final equation for plastic degradation:[v = frac{{d[P]}}{{dt}} = frac{{{k_2}{\rho _{EB}}}}{V}(frac{{{K_A}[EP]{q_{{E_{max }}}}A}}{{1 + {K_A} + {K_A}{K_B}[P]}} - frac{{{K_A}{K_B}{{[{E_P}]}^2}[P]}}{{{{(1 + {K_A})}^2}}})]The above equation is differential whose only variable is the concentrate of MHET.Connecting these two factor with the above total equation and substitute constants we can get:[v = frac{{c[EP](t - T)}}{{d + e[P](t)}} - f{([EP](t - T))^2}[P](t)]The concentration on PET surface is a function of time t-TSolve the above equation, then we get the curves of PET degradation rate in heterogeneous phase.From the figure above , the change of degradation rate can be divided into three stages no matter if there is liquid transmission.The mass transfer of enzymes in the liquid phase will cause some of them to stay in the liquid body and the delay of enzyme concentration changes on the PET surface.Based on the assumptions above and the description of PET degradation process in a heterogeneous system, we first establish the equation of measuring how much percent the PET degrades and how much the degrading rate is.We construct models for each step and finally deduce the rate curve of PET degradation by the enzymes secreted by bacteria in heterogeneous system.From this curve we can see that the degradation can be devided into 3 parts.In the first part, degradation rate is under the control of bacteria growth and enzyme secretion.In the second part, it is controlled by the mass transfer of enzyme in the liquid phase.In the third part, it is controlled by the catalytic ability of enzymes adsorbed on the PET surface .From the trend of the curve we can conclude that, in order to degrade PET with a higher rate or make the rate peak as soon as possible,what we first need to do is to promote the growth of bacteria.This will enhance the enzyme concentration.On the other hand, we can accelerate the diffusion of enzymes in the liquid phase.For example,shake cultivation or stirred culture,can eliminate the influence of time delay and make the degradation rate reach the peak fast.Our system assumes that PET degradation only takes place on the surface of PET.Although it s reasonable,as the degradation proceeds, small gaps will form on the plastics due to degradation.If they become so large that enzymes can diffuse into the interior of PET,degradation process will be accelerated to a huge extent.The next step of building models is to take the process and threshold value of internal diffusion into consideration.This will provide a more accurate model to describe the process of PET degradation in the heterogeneous system.Combining with the fraction of coverage we can get:[\theta = frac{{{q_E}}}{{{q_{{E_{max }}}}}} = frac{{{K_A}[E]}}{{1 + {K_A}[E]}}]Establishment of equation for rate of total degradation of PETAfter absorption to the surface, the combination and escape is a dynastic balancing process because of the competitive substrate.The enzymatic degradation is interfacial reaction before degradation in large scale.The whole process can be described in the following equation:[{r_x} = frac{{d{c_x}}}{{dt}} = {mu _m}{c_x}(1 - frac{{{c_x}}}{{{c_x}_m}})]Specific growth rate , namely the growth rate of a unit thalli concentrationWhen cells are in exponential phase, ? is generally a constant,soUnder the condition when t=0, cx=cx0, we integrate the formula above:[{c_x} = frac{{{c_x}_0{c_x}_m{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_x}_m - {c_x}_0(1 - {e^{{mu _m}t}})}}]Solve this equation and the growth curve can be obtained:The formation dynamics of expression product (PETase)The extreme diversity of metabolites produced by microbial fermentation and the complexity of biosynthesis routes in the cells cause the biosynthetic pathways and metabolic regulation mechanism of those metabolites to show diverse characterisitics.Then we use the general method of describing mass transfer process to establish mass transfer rate equation when enzymes diffuse from the cell surface to liquid phase body then from liquid phase body to the PET surface, and the distribution equation of enzyme concentration, respectively.When ??0 and ??0, the model is partial-growth coupling.Plug the cell growth rate into the equation to simplify:[{r_E} = frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = {c_x} cdot left[ {alpha {mu _m}(1 - frac{{{c_x}}}{{{c_{xm}}}}) + \beta } \right]][E = alpha (frac{{{c_{x0}}{c_m}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_m} - {c_{x0}} + {c_{x0}}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}} - {c_{x0}}) + frac{{\beta {c_{xm}}}}{{{mu _{xm}}}}ln frac{{{c_{xm}} - {c_{x0}} + {c_{x0}}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_{xm}}}}]Solve this equation and the production curve of PETase can be obtained:Compared with the growth curve of bacteria, we can see intuitively that at the beginning, the correlation between the enzymes production and the concentration of bacteria is high.Based on the stationary approximate theory, we can get the total dynamics equation.[\theta = frac{A}{{{A_0}}} = frac{{{q_E}}}{{{q_{{E_{max }}}}}}]The fraction of coverage by enzyme on the polymer surfaceThe content of absorption for enzyme per area on polymerBecause enzymatic catalytic step is a rete controlling step, the absorption on polymer surface is a dynamic balancing process.Rate of absorption:[{r_1} = d[ES]/dt = {k_1}[E](1 - \theta );]Rate of desorption:[{r_2} = d[E]/dt = {k_{ - 1}}\theta ]From r1=r-1, we can get: k1[E] (1-?) = k-1?.Thus we choose the ester bond number as an index to evaluate this degradation process.The calculation formula for calculating the number of moles of ester bonds (namely the number of moles when polymers are completely degraded):$${n_{EB}} = {n_{EB/{M_{rep}}}} cdot m/{M_{rep}} $$ The mole number of the broken ester bonds in theory(?mol)The molar mass of the repeat units in the polymer(?g/?mol)The percentage of degradation of ester bonds can be obtained through that ratio.Similarly, the degrading rate can also be described by a series of formulas shown below:The Equation for The Growth Rate of Enzyme ProteinsAccording to the characterisitics of microbial cell growth, Monod Equation is the most commonly used one.In our experiment we use engineered bacteria as machines to secrete PETase to degrade PET.At first the bacteria secrete PETase ,and then enzymes diffuse into liquid phase body from the cell surface ,from liquid to the surface of PET successively.PETase adsorbs on PET during which process the substrate binding sites of PETase contact with the surface.Finally PETase finds catalytic sites on plastics and combine them with its active center.Ester bonds are broken and chains in PET are ruptured,resulting in the degradation of PET.1.Marge constants:[v = frac{{c[{E_P}]}}{{d + e[P]}} - f{[{E_P}]^2}[P]]From the above figure, the rate of degradation without competitive restrain is pretty lower than it with competitive restrain.But the rate get down gradually with substrate restrain.Solution of PET Degradation Rate Considering The Whole SystemSolution of PET degradation rate considering the process of cells secrete proteinWe have got the rate of enzyme production by connecting with the growth process of cells before.Solve the above differential equation, we can get the curves of the rate of PET degradation as following:From the above figure, enzymes get to the absorption balance and get the biggest rate of degradation.We analyze and then make a conclusion that the mass transfer diffusion mainly leads to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface .Finally, taking that MHET, the product of PET degradation, will show competitive inhibition effect into consideration, based on the adsorption equilibrium of PETase on the PET surface, we use the steady state approximation theory and deduce the total kinetic equation of PETase degrading PET.Finally, PET degradation rate settle out because of both the two factor, mostly because the absorption gets its saturation.Rate of the whole process for cells to secrete and degrade in heterogeneous phaseWe just calculated the enzymatic degradation rate while ignored the transmission in the liquid.The universal model can be expressed by Leudeking-Piret Equation:[{r_E} = frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = alpha frac{{d{c_x}}}{{dt}} + \beta {c_x}]A product synthesis constant associated with bacteria growth(g\u0095g-1)A product synthesis constant irrelevant with bacteria growth(g\u0095g-1\u0095h-1)When ??0 and ?=0, the model is growth coupling.From those equations we can get the total mass transfer rate equation of the enzymes in a heterogeneous system.So there are two transfer processes before the enzymes adsorp on the PET surface.The mass transfer process of enzymes in the liquid phase bodyCells secrete enzymes to the outside.The rate of mass imported from the inner surface:$${r_{imp}}{\rm{ = }}{j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2}$$The rate of mass output from the outside surface is:$${r_{exp }}{\rm{ = }}{j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2}{\rm{ + }}frac{{partial ({j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2})}}{{partial r}}dr$$$${r_{acc}}{\rm{ = }}frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} cdot 4pi {r^2}dr$$Rate of exported mass \u0096 rate of imported mass + rate of accumulation \u0096 producing rate = 0$$frac{{partial ({j_{er}}{r^2})}}{{partial r}} + frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}}{r^2} - {R_E} = 0$$$${j_{er}} = - Dfrac{{partial E}}{{partial r}}$$Substitute and sort this equation.Finally PET will desorb enzymes.Establishment of dynamics equation for PET enzymatic degradationAssuming that there is a bonding site and an active center in the enzyme, it combines with the substrate through its bonding site and then degrades the polymer with its active site.And with the time passing by the correlation becomes lower and finally disappears.The Transfer Process of Enzymes in The Liquid PhaseThe secretion of enzymes from cells will inevitably lead to the increase of enzyme concentration nearby.The resistance of enzymes\u0092 spread from liquid body to the surface of PET is much larger than that of from the cells\u0092 surroundings to liquid body.5.On the other hand, the enzymes in the liquid phase will reach the surface of PET along with the free diffusion of molecules.Enzymes will act with polymers through their bonding sites and combine with the substrate after their secretion and diffusion to the PET surface from cells.It takes several steps for the enzymes to complete the degradation of PET.The degradation of PET takes place on the surface of PET.7.Since the classical dynamics equation for enzymatic reaction, Michaelis-Menten equation, is based on homogeneous enzyme- substrate system, it\u0092s not suitable to describe the process of the degradation of polymers.Solve this differential equation we obtain the degradation rate curve of PET under heterogeneous system.The Formulas for Calculating Biodegradation Percentage and The Degradation RateSince our project aims to degrade PET, we need to propose a stable index to measure the degree of degradation of the plastics and another one to measure the degradation rate.When there is competitive restrain, the change of degradation rate can be divided into three stages.Thus we utilize the Logistic Equation to describe the rhythm of the growth rate.Logisic model is a typical S-shaped curve that can reflect the inhibition effect caused by the increase of bacteria concentration in the fermentation process.In this system, the adsorption of enzymes on the PET surface will lead to the accumulation of the enzymes.That can be reasonable because absorption is just related to the concentration of enzyme on the PET surface.And when enzyme concentrations surrounding the cells are larger than that in the liquid phase body, a driving force will emerge, causing the diffusion of enzymes into liquid phase body.In this system the product molecules still contain ester bonds, as a result, MHET may act with the enzymes before its diffusion into the solution and restrain the combination between PET and PETase.We assume that the enzymes are firstly combined with the polymer substrate through their own substrate binding sites, and then the active centers catalyzed the degradation of the polymers.6.And the liquid transmission effect the second stage most, at which cells grow up and secret more.Here we choose to describe degradation rate and percentage.The role of PETase plays in the degradation is to catalyze the cleavage of ester bonds between TPA and EG.Then the enzymes catalyze to break the ester bonds, and the small molecules such as MHET will be released and diffuse into the liquid phase.Here a cell can be regarded as a sphere and there\u0092s a spherical shell composed by the enzymes in the outer surface of the sphere.The transmission will lead to loss of the effective enzyme and latency of arrival for enzyme to PET surface.Through the above description of the process, the enzyme need to find an active segment to combine with.Second, the secretion controlling stage at which the secretion rate gets to saturation because of the saturation of cell growth.This competitive restraint will lead to a declination in the catalysis rate.Although this equation is considered to be simple and effective when used to describe the growth of bacteria, it is only suitable under the condition that there is no other restrictive substances in the

our professor Yingjin Yuan gave us a safety instruction in which he informed us about how to work in the lab and what was considered as good practice.The toxic reagents are carefully used fume hood and we have separate waste bottles for all of the byproducts with each reagent, so that the waste could be treated and properly disposed of.And our project, aiming at degrading PET in a biological way, will not only help to solve plastic pollution problem, but also by using the enzymes will reduce the environment re-pollution introduced by conventional chemical decomposition and landfill, which is rather environmentally friendly.The Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtillis DB104, E.coli DE3, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Rhodococcus sp.PCC6803 used are not thought to pose any risk to the

as well as its future applications.We were able to insert 2A between our marker, amilCP (a blue chromoprotein) and the coding sequence for the HIV-B surface antigen in our construct.Help with the Design of an HBsAg Expression System Throughout the summer, Emmanuel Asare, Ph.D., in the Stony Brook University Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, helped our team with the design of a workable system for expressing HIV-B antigen that would be secreted from yeast cells.We needed to develop a construct that would allow us to couple the production of the surface antigen with the production of a visible marker for easy recognition of production, and so decided initially to build a composite part using promoter regions in front of each of the coding sequences.Dr.This affects our project in the following ways:  Despite going through an intermediate service, reproducible yeast could still be a cheap alternative to current methods of early detection.However, there is the concern that making the test through a third party could increase costs.Ribosomes scanning over 2A during the process of elongation will cleave nascent peptides between a glycine and incoming proline amino acid, which they cannot bind together.We spoke about the viability of using our yeast as a non-invasive early-detection tool by performing periodic blood tests on patients who are more

combustion in vehicle engines give off Carbon dioxide and water as products: $$\textrm{Fuel} + \textrm{Air} longrightarrow \textrm{CO}_2 + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{Unaffected Nitrogen}$$ However, most car engines in the developing world are not very efficient and produce carbon monoxide ($\textrm{CO}$) and oxides of nitrogen ($\textrm{NO}_x$) along with other pollutants.Our aim is to produce a portable, quick, and easy\u0096to\u0096use biosensor for environmental law enforcement agencies, and even consumers, that can detect for levels of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in vehicle exhausts and express corresponding chromoproteins as a result.The system is based on two separate gas\u0096sensing mechanisms that work together to give a range of results: The CO\u0096sensing mechanism uses the CooA transcription factor and two CooA\u0096dependent promoters: CooF and CooM.The change in color caused by the chromoproteins indicate the presence of oxides of nitrogenThe second system that works for the detection of CO, consists of an activator CooA, which is normally present in an inactive form in the system and requires the presence of two molecules of CO in order to get activated.It is composed of four parts:The pCooM device produces pCooM, which is a weak promoter, with a GFP expression.The system also comprises of two promoters including pCooF and pCooM that are sensitive to the presence of CO. pCooF is a strong promoter and requires the attachment of two molecules of CO, while pCooM is a weak promoter where the attachment of eight molecules of CO is necessary in order to express the GFP.The activated (CooA)2CO complex will now bind to the promoters, the activated promoter will lead to the production of GFP, that has the tendency to indicate that CO is present in the system.We used two different chromoproteins in our system.Our biosensor, on the other hand, will be cheap, easy\u0096to\u0096use, and highly portable.The project centers around a biosensor with two detection systems: one system for the detection of CO, and the other for detection of oxides of nitrogen, particularly, NO and NO$_2$.The parts are:The pCooF device codes for the strong promoter which senses the presence of CO, and then expresses GFP.The parts includes:The PyeaR device code for PYeaR promoter, which when interacts with oxides of nitrogen produces GFP.Usually a repressor in a cell is attached to two promoters; pYeaR and pNirK , when the cell is surrounded by NOx , molecules of NOx get attached to the repressor, relieving the two promoters which further transcribe a gene responsible for yellow chromoprotein.When both of the gases CO and NOx are present, the cell will transcribe both blue and yellow chromoproteins giving off a color in a shade of green.They have been linked to the deaths of 23500 patients in UK each year.The methods used for measuring gaseous concentration are Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) and Gas Chromatography (GC) for carbon monoxide, and Gas Phase Chemiluminescence for nitrogen oxides.It is composed of four parts:The PNirK device is used for the GFP expression.The total number of motor vehicles in Karachi is a staggering 1.82 million, with 16,000 new ones hitting the road every month.Although laws and regulations regarding vehicle emissions exist, the World Bank s Cleaning Pakistan s Air report points out implementation as a major problem.When CO is present in the system, two molecules of CO will bind to the inactive activator, thus making it active.The devices includes:The CooA device comprises of four parts and is responsible for the production of CooA activator protein.It uses four parts:NsrR device is composed of four parts and is responsible for the production of NsrR repressor protein.When there is CO present outside the cell, the CO device gets activated and gives off blue color.Oxides of nitrogen bind to the NsrR repressor which, depending on the concentration of nitrogen oxides, activates either the YeaR promoter, or both the Year promoter and Nirk promoter.The situation is worse for developing countries where air quality levels of 98% of cities exceed WHO limits.A World Bank report released in 2014 states that the consequences of air pollution suffered by Pakistan are the highest in South Asia; air pollution is responsible for more deaths than other high\u0096profile causes of mortality in this country.The NOx\u0096sensing mechanism uses the NsrR repressed promoters, YeaR and NirK, as well as the NorV promoter.The continuous deterioration of air quality, especially in urban areas, is a matter of global concern.$$\textrm{Fuel} + \textrm{Air} longrightarrow \textrm{CO}_2 + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{Unburned Hydrocarbons} + \textrm{CO} + \textrm{NO}_x$$Carbon monoxide is a partially oxidized product of combustion reaction.On the other hand, if NOx is present outside the cell, the NOx device in the engineered cell gets activated.With more than 10.6 million vehicles on the road, Pakistani cities of Karachi, Peshawar, and Rawalpindi are among the 20 most polluted cities in the world.It is formed when the hydrocarbon fuel is not completely oxidized to carbon dioxide.This activation of promoters results in the expression of their respective chromoproteins.", "design": "But don t opt for a complete redesign because \u0097 in all likelihood \u0097 it would turn out to be a bite too big to chew.CSS code to make the iGEM s right-side menus and other annoyances disappearOnce you have made your offline website, you will then paste its HTML code on your team s page, and link the CSS and JavaScript files (which you would also have to upload to iGEM).For example, they place all fonts in a fonts folder, and images in an img folder, and then use relative paths in the code to access these assets in their CSS or HTML code.When designing an iGEM wiki, you must not use local resources.After you are done developing the wiki, all you need to do to make your \"offline\" wiki \"online\" is to just copy and paste your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code on your iGEM Team pages.We then dumped all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at the very last hour on to the iGEM server.But you must take care of a few things if you want to follow this approach:Usually, when web developers develop websites locally \u0097 i.e., offline \u0097 they use all assets locally.You will quickly find it out using the Statcounter s analytics because none of your visitors will be opening this Notebook page, and it won t get registered in the Statcounter logs.Using StatCounter you can get useful statistics on your wiki visitors: You can view their IP addresses, the browser they were using, their screen resolution and operating system, the pages they visited, and how long they remained on any particular page.Instead, you should make separate HTML files for these reusable elements of the website, and then use the .kit language to import them in your pages as needed \u0097 super convenient if you ask me.Instead make your wiki locally first just like a normal website, and then copy and paste the HTML and CSS code on your team s iGEM pages.You can use the girdlover tool to choose the size of your h and p elements that follow the Golden ratio.Once you design you wiki, you would want to know how many visitors are visiting your website, and how much time they are spending on any particular page.By adding StatCounter s tracking code, you can track not only how many visitors are visiting your wiki each day, but you can also get the finer details, such as their country, their browser and operating system, their screen resolution, the referring link, the view time, and duration.A wiki using them will be slower than the one using Neat, which is a minimalistic and light weight framework \u0097 all the more reasons to start using Neat in your next wiki or web design project.iGEM provides a very basic editor to edit your Team s wiki pages, but using it is a real pain.Instead, you should first upload them to iGEM servers, and then use the absolute path of these assets in your CSS or HTML.Use Allow CORS and Cache Killer Chrome extensions during developmentWhen you are working on a local website which is using online assets, the assets will fail to load in your web-browser.Don t expect someone with a biology background and zero programming experience to be able to redesign the wiki.In case you happen to end up in a team in which no one has any programming or web development experience, then it s probably better that you stick with default iGEM wiki template and tinker with its styling to improve it or customize to your taste.For first timers, completely redesigning the wiki could be an overwhelmingly difficult experience, partly due to the scant information available on how to do it exactly.Here, we present some of the lessons we learned while completely redesigning our iGEM wiki for the first time in the hope that some teams in the coming years will find it useful.A responsive wiki adjusts its content to different screen-sizes by tweaking its layout so that the main content is always visible clearly without the user needing to zoom-in or scroll horizontally.A responsive website adjusts its layout according to the size of the device it is being viewed on.Searching responsive menus on CodePen churns out a whole catalog of menus that you could choose from and use in your wiki.Do you want a cool menu in your wiki?Use the Cache Killer Chrome extensionto purge the cache every time you refresh your webpage.Use Live Reload to automatically refresh the webpage you are currently developingEvery time you make changes in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, you will need to save these changes and then refresh your webpage to view the changes take effect.Either use Codekit s Preview feature or use Live Reload software to refresh the webpage automatically whenever you make any changes in your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.The smaller the size, the faster the webpage will load.Moreover, combine all your CSS files into single CSS file, and all your JavaScript files (except MathJax.js) into a single JavaScript file.There are three major grid frameworks you could choose from:If you use Bootstrap or Foundation, you will litter your HTML markup with presentation classes from these frameworks, which is not a good practice; the content should always be separate from its presentation.But you will find that the iGEM right-side menu will be still there, and your layout will be all messed up.We went through this and spent a fair amount of time solving it.Although iGEM provides a basic skeleton for the wiki \u0097 that can be easily filled by anyone who has some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS \u0097 most teams prefer to completely redesign the look and feel of their wiki.Once you ve done that, include the consolidated CSS and JavaScript files in your Wiki pages.For example, _header.kit file contains HTML code for the header section of our wiki pages and we are importing the contents of this file in the code above.For screen widths above 1000px, the iGEM wiki lays out the menu vertically as a sidebar.Don t use relative paths of your assets when developing your iGEM wiki offline.Always used absolute paths of your assets when developing your iGEM wiki offline.Example of use of relative path of assets.You can then use these fonts on your wiki as well.FontFaceNinja could be used to identify fonts on any element of a webpage.Off course, you would have to do a few minors tweaks to link your CSS and JavaScript files, but no major changes would be needed.One of the easiest way to find it out is to use the FontFaceNinja extension in Chrome to identify the fonts used on different elements of a websites.Developing a killer wiki would need skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Sass.You won t need to use any presentation classes in your HTML markup if you use the Neat grid framework.Codekit will compile the files for you so that the separate snippets are included inline in the final HTML output.Just add the following code at the top of your CSS to make all the annoyances disappear.In the above illustration of our responsive wiki, the picture and bio get re-arranged depending on the size of the window.In a responsive web design, the website tweaks its layout for different screen sizes for best user experience.Single CSS and JavaScript files will require single http requests; the smaller the number of http requests, the faster the website is going to load.HTML now contains only the page s content.You must also take care of the font size, line height, and measure of your text so that everything is easily readable and looks nice at the same time.We have combined all our individual CSS files (shown on the right) into a single minified CSS file (main.css) using CodeKit.Live Reload can work on both Windows and Mac whereas, Codekit is a Mac-only software.While developing your website locally, use .kit language to reuse your code snippet across many different pages.Similarly, _all_in_one_footer.kit file contains HTML code for the footer of the website.Your custom\u0096designed wiki can have as many breakpoint as you like, but we think that a single breakpoint, around 1000px, is enough.The default iGEM wiki template for the year 2016 uses a breakpoint of 1000px.You don t have to reinvent the wheel.Typography plays a key role in the look and feel of a website.All this information can provide you with valuable insights that you can then use to improve your current wiki, or the one next year.You will need to enable Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) using Allow CORS Chrome extension.Furthermore, you would also need to empty your cache every time you reload a page because you made some changes in it.<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/main.css\"> <!--End of on-canvas container for all the content-->An example of how to reuse code snippets by writing them in separate files and then importing them using .kit language s @import statement.Search responsive menu on CodePen and will find code for a ton of responsive menus - all free to use.Don t waste your time and energy developing your wiki online using the iGEM wiki editor.", "human_practice": "We took this to our government.Our product was intended to be in the form of a strip.To counter their concerns, we designed a  killbox  plan that will be used to  sterilize  the strip after usage.The twister in the middle can help breaking the wall in between them, degrading the engineered bacteria.To promote synthetic biology in Pakistan, we wrote a detailed policy paper to the government in which we gave them short term, medium term, and long term recommendations on how to do it exactly.After a thorough response and data analysis, we figured out that the general population was quite receptive to the idea of a bacterial strip test, albeit they were still unsure if the bacteria on the strip could spread into the environment and cause problems.Our new design, incorporates a box having two sections: one section in which the strip having the engineered\u0096bacteria will be placed in the nutrient media, whereas in the other section we will have bacterial\u0096killers.The strip can be used several times until the media gets expired.We also wrote a policy paper for the development of the field of Synthetic Biology in Pakistan.", "modeling": "It can be calculated by the following equation: $$P_{exp} = frac{\textrm{number of situations in which the promoter will be activated}}{\textrm{total number of situations}} = frac{w}{z} label{4} \tag{4}$$ In our modeling of the CO-sensing system, we have assumed that at any moment only one molecule of the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ can bind to the promoter, and that the \ref{R1} reaches equilibrium before the transcription of the system begins.To develop our equations further, we say that the number of situations in which a promoter will be activated is equal to: $$ w=\textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]}=frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p} label{5} \tag{5}$$ Eq.(\ref{5}) demonstrates the relation between the binding of the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$, showing that it is equal to the amount of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ upon the dissociation constant of the binding of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ to the promoter.To simplify this equation, we assume that the number of situations in which the promoter will not be activated by $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ is equal to $1$.Note that this assumption is made because the only situation in which transcription will not take place is when there are no molecules bound to the promoter.Substituting the assumptions in Eq.$$\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]} longleftrightarrow \textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]} label{R2} \tag{R2}$$ Here, $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]}$ represents the activated protein $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ bound to the promoter.To develop a dissociation constant of this equation, we can write as: Now, in order to get an equation which describes the change in the concentration of mRNA with time we develop the following differential equation: where, $k_{on1}$ is represents the formation rate constant of the mRNA, and $gamma_1$ represents the degradation rate constant of mRNA.In Eq.(\ref{3}), $P_{exp}$ represents the probability that the promoter will be activated by the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$.The coefficient 2 represents the number of CO which bind to CooA; this number was taken from the literature.To develop a dissociation constant of this equation, we can write it as: Note that the concentrations of $\textrm{[CO]}$, $\textrm{[CooA]}$, and $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ are at equilibrium before the start of the reaction R1.The second reaction that takes place in our system is the binding of the activated activator protein complex of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ to the promoter Pr.(\ref{4}), we get: $$P_{exp} = frac{w}{z} = frac{frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}}{frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}+1} label{7} \tag{7}$$ As we want our $P_{exp}$ to be expressed in the terms of $\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$ separately instead of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$, we repeat these above equations by taking into consideration \ref{R1} and its dissociation constant $\textrm{KI}$.$$\textrm{[CO]}+\textrm{[CooA]} longleftrightarrow \textrm{[(CooA)2CO]} label{R1} \tag{R1}$$ The equation above represents the first reaction that takes place in our system in which the CO present in the environment is taken up into the cell where it binds to the CooA protein.(\ref{5}), we get: $$ z=w+1=frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}+1 label{6} \tag{6}$$ where, $z$ represents the total number of situations, $w$ represents the number of situations in which the promoter will be activated, and $1$ represents the number of situations in which the promoter will not be activated.Sustituting Eq.The initial condition for this equation was $\textrm{[mRNA(t=0)] = 0 molar}$.The analytical solution of this differential equation is equal to: Now that we have got the equation describing the change in concentration of mRNA, we can use the same method to derive an equation which describes the change in the concentration of the chromoprotein in time as following: $$frac{d\textrm{[CP]}}{dt} = k_{on2}.\textrm{[mRNA]}-gamma_2\textrm{[CP]} label{9} \tag{9}$$ Here, $k_{on2}$ is the formation rate constant of the chromoprotein and $gamma_2$ is the degradation rate constant of the chromoprotein.Figure 1: The central theme considered for mathematical modeling of CO system, where the chromoprotein DNA leads to the production of mRNA of chromoprotein and then subsequently of chromoprotein.(\ref{10}) is the final equation which describes the amount of $\textrm{[CP]}$ along with the amount of $\textrm{[mRNA]}$.1.(\ref{3}) it can be seen that the change in the $\textrm{[mRNA]}$ with time is equal to the difference of the formation rate of mRNA and its degradation rate.The initial conditions for the Eq.$\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$ concentrations inside the cell are constant.Table 1: Parameters, their description, and their values used in MATLAB simulation of CO-sensing system.Dissociation Constant of the binding of $\textrm{(CO2CooA)}$ to the promoter0.006 $\textrm{min}^{-1}$ / 0.0051 $\textrm{min}^{-1}$(\ref{8}) demonstrates, $P_{exp}$ depends only upon the concentration of $\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$.Only one molecule of the complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ can be bound to the promoter at a time.4.(\ref{9}), which is: $$\textrm{[CP]} = k_{on2}.frac{k_{on1}.P_{exp}}{gamma_1.gamma_2}(1-e^{-gamma_2t}) + k_{on2}.frac{k_{on1}.P_{exp}}{gamma_1(gamma_1-gamma_2)}(e^{-gamma_2t}-e^{-gamma_1t}) label{10} \tag{10}$$ Eq.$$P_{exp} = frac{frac{\textrm{[CooA]}.frac{frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}{1+frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}}{K_p}} {1+frac{\textrm{[CooA]}.frac{frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}{1+frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}}{K_p}} label{8} \tag{8}$$ As the Eq.Again, the initial conditions for this equation are assumed to be: which states that at the initial time, the amount of chromoprotein in the cell is equal to $0$.Here on forth, we will repeat the steps from Eq.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "However, even while in the lab, our project does pose some risks and these are discussed below.For our chassis we are using NEB s 5\u0096alpha Competent E.coli (high efficiency) cells which are a derivative of the K12 strain and not a dangerous substance or mixture according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS).Since this is a lab strain and a K12 derivative, it is non\u0096pathogenic and genetically crippled to the extent that it cannot survive outside a controlled environment.All chemical reactions were and are being done in the Fume hood with complete protection including goggles.Our lab has a separate, cordoned-off area for gel electrophoresis.Our device is meant to be used to outside the lab in a real world setting, but since we are currently focused on the actual sensing circuit aspect more than the device design, we have not included any kill-switch yet (we did start designing a Kill\u0096Box which is discussed below).Because the dye Ethidium Bromide is a very hazardous chemical, all gel running and handling was done while wearing gloves, lab coats and eye protection.Even if the bacteria somehow survived outside the lab, the risks are very small.The twister in the middle can

examination is quite time-consuming, usually taking a whole day to accomplish and a whole week to wait for the results, which bothers busy office workers in China a lot, resulting in their low participation in physical examinations.In suburbs, especially in many poverty-stricken mountain areas in the west of China, local residents are inaccessible to take physical examinations due to the crude medical conditions and the high cost of examinations.We managed to engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast strain with great abundance of background information and simple genetic manipulations, to make it a promising choice for individual to make early diagnosis domestically with low cost.What\u0092s worse, the age of morbidity crowd displays a younger trend due to unhealthy lifestyle.In fact, many diseases can be prevented by encouraging more people to do physical examinations to prevent or treat diseases in the first place.In 2015, there are approximately 92.4 million people of diabetes, 170 million people of hypertension and 4.3 million newly added cancer cases in China according to the Chinese Health Big Data .", "design": "SMT: our chassis yeast cell; AC: adenylyl cyclase; cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; Gpa2: Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha; Gpr1: plasma membrane G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for glucose sensing; NLc: Nano-lantern (cAMP 1.6); ADRB2: human adrenergic receptor beta 2; Gpa2M: S. cerevisiae Gpa2 with 5 amino acids from human G(s) alpha-subunit.As shown in figure 1, we named our chassis yeast cell \u0091SMT\u0092, which stands for \u0091smart\u0092.In our project, we utilized 2 kinds of GPCRs, namely Gpr1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for glucose sensing and ADRB2 from Homo sapiens for catecholamine sensing, they are picturized as follows [6, 7]:Fig.3 Gpr1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (A) and ADRB2 from Homo sapiens (B).Increase the response speed of whole cell biosensorThe majority of yeast-based biosensors use a reporter gene under the control of an inducible promoter.: The first type of elements is promoter, they are used to control the expression of other elements in yeast; the second type of elements is reporter protein, Nano-lantern(cAMP-1.6), which allows detection of cellular response to extracellular ligands within 10 minutes; the third type of elements is G protein coupled receptor, ADRB2, which allows detection of the disease biomarker of phaeochromocytoma, excreted epinephrine.The overall constructing process can be figured as bellow:Fig.1 The construct process of real-time yeast disease biosensor.cAMP serves as a second messenger in cellular signaling, and its intracellular level can be soared very rapidly (within 10 min) with the catalysis of adenylyl cyclase, which is activated by G protein alpha subunit when the ligands bind corresponding GPCR.However, nearly all of the existing yeast biosensors are transcription-based, which means they need a long time to yield the detectable sequence, even though previous researchers have enhanced the signal coupling ability of heterologous expressed GPCRs, the response and culture time make it hard to be operated by ordinary individuals and served as a domestic testing chip[5, 8, 9].[6]Kraakman, L., et al., A Saccharomyces cerevisiae G-protein coupled receptor, Gpr1, is specifically required for glucose activation of the cAMP pathway during the transition to growth on glucose.Yeast is an excellent eukaryotic chassis which can be used to assemble diversity of sensor molecules, and so as to increase the composability, we chose the G-protein couple receptor as our sensing element because of its highly patterned structure and incredibly wide range of ligands.The G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large superfamily of transmembrane proteins that mediate cellular responses to diverse extracellular stimuli, including light, neurotransmitters, hormones and odorants.At the first stage, where our goal is to create a real-time yeast glucose sensor, we utilized the endogenous yeast glucose sensing mechanism, which starts with the binding of glucose to Gpr1 receptor and ends with the altered gene expression.Moreover, the existing testing methods only apply to a quite limit range of non-molecular or molecular indices, like blood pressure, blood sugar and HCG, and if one wish to detect a wider range of markers, the prices will soar up because of the high expenditure of ELISA based chips.First, as a eukaryotic cell, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like Escherichia coli as the model bacterium.After activation by agonist-bound GPCR, the GTP-bound alpha subunit and the beta-gamma complex are free to modulate the activity of a variety of effector proteins, including adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, G-protein-gated Ca2+ and K+ channels, and membrane-proximal elements of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signal-transduction pathways[4].Though several transcripton-independent sensors have been created, the indices that can be detected still remain limited[1, 10].As we were going to use the GPCR signaling pathway as our sensing mechanism, we looked for molecules downstream the GPCR from G-proteins to transcription factors which can be changed rapidly after binding with the ligands.Finally, we tried to used modified yeast G alpha subunit, Gpa2, to increase the efficiency of functional coupling between heterologously expressed ADRB2 and yeast endogenous signaling pathway, but we didn\u0092t go any further than making the right insertion construct pADH1-Gpa2M as time was limited.Cell-based biosensing, in general, and yeast-based biosensing (YBB) in particular have many advantages for certain diagnostic and analytical applications.Being eukaryotic cell makes S. cerevisiae capable of serving as a chassis for genetic engineering involves mammalian sensing elements, such as G-protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors[1, 2].[7]Rasmussen, S.G., et al., Crystal structure of the human beta2 adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor.In order to make people capable of knowing their health conditions so that they can figure out what is going wrong at early stage, our goal has always been to create an in vitro yeast disease biosensor which allows people to:Monitor their disease biomarkers at a range as wide as possibleTo achieve our goal, we managed to construct the biosensor for diagnosis of two diseases, diabetes and phaeochromocytoma, using urine sugar and epinephrine as their biomarkers.[9]Ishii, J., et al., Microbial fluorescence sensing for human neurotensin receptor type 1 using G alpha-engineered yeast cells.So we sought to find a way to indicate the intracellular cAMP level to reveal the extracellular ligand level.An excellent cAMP indicator has been developed by professor Nagai, it is a fusion protein named Nano-lantern(cAMP-1.6), it requires no excitation light and can be observed under optical microscope[11].Second, it can be made in \u0091active dry\u0092 form cheaply and stored for long periods of time, thus the shelf-life of yeast biosensor makes it a potential in vitro diagnostic biosensor[2].The construct of the protein can be picturized as below:Fig.4 The construct detail of Nano-lantern(cAMP-1.6) (A) and its mechanism (B).Freeze-drying is a two-step dehydration process used for the long-term preservation of perishable materials, including living cells.Cloning of the human genome has revealed about 1000 GPCRs\u0097400 for neurotransmitters and hormones (transmitters, as a general term) and about 600 presumed odorant and gustatory receptors (sensory receptors).[8]Fukuda, N., et al., Amplification of agonist stimulation of human G-protein-coupled receptor signaling in yeast.So we cloned a cAMP sensing protein, Nano-lantern (cAMP 1.6) downstream three kinds of yeast endogenous promoters, pADH1, pGAL1 and pCUP1 into pBluescript with homologous sequence of TRP1, then we made genomic insertion at TRP1 locus in SMT cells yielding strains SMT-pAN, SMT-pGN and SMT-pCN, respectively.Then at stage 2, creating yeast epinephrine sensor, we managed to clone human adrenergic receptor beta-2 (ADRB2) downstream ADH1 and GAL1 promoter and inserted these cassettes at HIS3 locus of SMT-pAN yielding strains SMT-pANpAA and SMT-pANpGA.High-specificity biosensing can be carried out in a micron-scale unit (the cell) without power requirements or the need for a highly trained operator.The promoters are activated in the presence of a ligand of interest, either directly by the ligand/receptor dimer or via a signaling cascade.The GPCRs amplify and transduce the information inherent in ligand binding to the cell interior via interaction with intracellular heterotrimeric G-proteins.As a result, the G-protein complex undergoes guanine-nucleotide exchange and subunit dissociation in response to the agonist.Nano-lantern(cAMP-1.6) contains a portion of enhance YFP with 10 amino acids deleted at C terminus, denoted as Venus?C10, a portion of mutated Renilla luciferase with 3 amino acids deleted at N terminus, Rluc8, and a cAMP binding domain of EPAC1 (Exchange Protein Directly Activated by cAMP) flanked by two separate parts of Rluc8.[2]Jarque, S., M. Bittner, and K. Hilscherova, Freeze-drying as suitable method to achieve ready-to-use yeast biosensors for androgenic and estrogenic compounds.The most common reporting systems for yeast biosensors are fluorescence, luminescence, colorimetry, electrical methods and growth rate[1].A research group from Czech Republic has employed this technology for their ER/AR yeast biosensors[2].Upon binding with the cAMP molecule, the catalytic activity of the split luciferase will increase as the separate parts are brought together because of the conformational change in EPAC, thus results in the change in luminescence via the BRET effect.", "human_practice": "To make our Human Practice work more organized, we cut our work into several unique parts.", "modeling": "This part is mostly related to our

any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.For LB medium using for bacteria inoculation, split the medium into 5ml and transfer the 5ml medium respectively into 15ml tubes before autoclaving.For LB agar medium, after the temperature of the medium cooling down to around 50 ?, add appropriate volume of antibiotic into the medium.Cryoprotectant: A 40%(w/v) trehalose solution in ddH2O was prepared and sterilized through filtration.A single yeast colony from an agar plate was grown overnight in liquid YPGal medium until it enters lag phase (OD600=1.8-2.0) The OD600 of the medium was adjusted to 8 and mixed with 40% trehalose solution at the proportion of 1:1.1mL of the mixture was transferred into an eppendorf tube and was pre-frozen at -20? for 30min and -80? for 30minThe mixture was freeze-dried at 0.120mbar (collector temperature -40?) for 24h using a freeze-drier.After the freeze-drying process, yeast were reconstituted into complex medium in the volume initially used (culture + cryoprotectant) during 3h at 30?.Centrifuge at 5000rpm for 2min and discard the supernatant.Resuspend with 200?L of cracking buffer, add 200?L of glass powder and 200?L of

30min.As for the ligation process, we use the T4 ligase from Thermo Scientific (#EL0011) or Exnase from Vazyme (C112-01/02).All of the ligation process we did using T4 ligase were between sticky ends, the reaction mixture was as following:Then incubate 1h at 22? (we chose to incubate for 1h instead of 10 min just to make sure that all the fragments were ligated).Then 5 \u00b5l of the ligated products were used for transformation of 50 \u00b5l chemically competent cell.As the Exnase employs the strategy of homologous recombination, when designing primers for PCR of the insert fragment, we introduced 15 bp homologous sequences into 5\u0092 end of primers, aiming to making the ends of amplified insertions and linearized cloning vector identical to the ends of their neighbours which is required for recombination reaction.Pellet the cells at 4,000 rpm for 1 min and remove water, add: Centrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 1 min and remove the transformation mix Wash gently with 1.0 ml water, centrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 1 min, aspirate, resuspend in 300 ul water, then spread on the plate.Elute the DNA by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (14,000-18,000 x g) for 1 minute.As it takes time to amplify a extracted plasmid of low concentration, the final elution volume could be smaller than required.Synthetic dextrose medium without carbon and nitrogen source (SD-N)For certain auxotrophic medium, eliminate the corresponding components above.Note: The final concentration of Cu2+ in induction median for pCUP1 should be 50?M.The identified yeast colonies were picked and inoculated into 8mL of liquid YPD medium, respectively.Residual ethanol may interfere with downstream applications.Transfer the HiBind\u00ae DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Add 30-50 ?L Elution Bu er or deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.Note: The efficiency of eluting DNA from the HiBind\u00ae DNA Mini Column is dependent on pH.So put the ready-made gels into a box with TBE solution buffer as storage.Load the DNA sample and appropriate DNA ladder to the gel.An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.Advice: In step 13, the liquid used to dissolve the DNA should be heated to around 55? if the room temperature is rather low, like below 10?.We used E.Z.N.A.Approximately 20ml of LB agar medium is applied to each 90mm plate.As for the antibiotics, we only use ampicillin, and the storage concentration and working concentration are 50 mg/ml and 50 ?g/ml.All of the restriction endonuclease we used were from NEB, and a \"Typical\" restriction digestion can be set as follows:As for the restriction enzyme, every enzyme should be kept on ice when not in the freezer and the last component added to reaction.The medium was shaken at 30\u00b0 C overnight until the OD600 reaches 0.8-1.0.Take 2OD of medium into a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 5000rpm for 2min, discard the supernatant.Resuspend the yeast with 1mL of sterile ddH2O and transfer the mixture into an 1.5mL EP tube.Cells were transferred to white 96-well flat bottom plates.The Luciferase substrate coelenterazine-h (YEASEN) was diluted from the stock according to the manufacturer\u0092s protocol, the working solution should be at a final concentration of 10 uM.Grow at 37\u00b0C for 14-16 hours with vigorous shaking.Harvest bacterial culture by centrifugation for 1 minute at 10,000 x g. Add 450 ?L Buffer A1 and completely resuspend bacterial pellet by vortexing or pipetting (Complete resuspension is critical for optimal yields).Add 450 ?L Buffer B1, mix gently by inverting 10 times (do not vortex) and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.Also, we first chose NEB High-Fidelity (HF\u0099) enzymes that provide added flexibility to reaction setup.As for the NEBuffer, we only used CutSmart buffer as it has the widest applicability to NEB enzymes, thus make the restriction design simpler.As for the incubation time, we use 4.5 hour in order to digest the DNA template completely.Add a drop of champagne to the slidenoculate 10 mL of YPD media with fresh cells and grow at 30\u00b0C to log phase(8-12h)Add 1.2mL 37% formaldehyde to fix the cells.Recombination product is now ready for transformation, or otherwise it can be stored at -20\u00b0C before transformation.Suck up 1?l bacterial liquid DH5? or pick a colony from the plate and leave the bacteria into 5ml LB medium.Synergy2 Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) was used to measure the luminescence signal.20 ? l each of diluted coelenterazine-h (to a final concentration of 10 ? M) and ligand solution were added to the cell mixture, mixed by shaking and incubated for 2min.Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Add ethidium bromide solution (5?l/100ml) after the agarose solution cooling down.Place the comb into the gel mold.If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes slightly clear.Note: Buffer B1 precipitates (cloudy look) below room temperature.If eluting DNA with deionized water, make sure that the pH is around 8.5.Note: This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA.Assuming a density of 1 g/mL, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 mL.Incubate at 60\u00b0C for 7 minutes or until the gel has completely melted.Make sure that the picked colony is a single colony.Shake overnight.PCR amplify the insert DNA with specific primers as discussed above.Linearized the cloning vectors by restriction digesting with endonuclease.Set up the following reaction on ice.As for the incubation temperature, the enzyme we used were all good at 37?.We make sure that all the components be mixed well using the pipette or flicking.Add 100-200?L TE to dissolve the precipitate, and store at -20\u00b0 C.Incubate 50 ml YPD culture at 30? on a shaker at 250 rpm until its equivalent to 1 OD600 (2 x 107 cells/ml).Their corresponding mass can be roughly calculated according the following formula:The mass of vector required = [0.02\u00d7number of base pair] ng (0.03 pmol)The mass of fragment required = [0.04\u00d7number of base pair] ng (0.06 pmol)After finishing setting up, gently pipette up and down several times with a pipettor to mix thoroughly and try to avoid the formation of bubbles.Except for the NCBI primer blast, which is completely automatic, the general consideration for designing primers could be:The length of primers should be limited between 18~60bp.False priming, hairpin structure and cross dimers should not appear, if they appear, make sure they wouldn\u0092t impact the PCR efficiency badly.If there are some extra bases at the 5\u0092 end of the primers, the annealing temperature of the sequence pairing with the template should be 57-60? The primers are synthesized by GENEray.The volume of the medium should not exceed 1/3 volume of the tube, or else the bacteria may be deprived of oxygen.Pick the selected colony by the tip and leave the tip directly into the tube.From the pre-culture, cells were diluted into fresh media at 0.05OD600 and continued to grow in low florescent galactose media until 1.0 OD600.Cells equivalent to 0.3OD600 were spun, supernatant was discarded and cells were re-suspended in 160 ? l of PBS.Add a cover glass on the slide.It is important to allow the cells to complete at least two divisions.Harvest the culture in a sterile 50 ml centrifuge tube at 5000 rpm for 4 min.Apply the agarose solution to the mold and wait for 30mins to get the solid agarose gel.Aspirate the medium, resuspend the cells in 5 ml of sterile water, and divide into aliquots.Incubate at RT for 30minTransfer cells to conical tube and pellet by centrifuging at 3000rpm for 3min Aspirate supernatant and wash cells with 1 mL 0.1mol/L potassium phosphate for 2-3 times.Cult ure until the liquids\u0092 OD600 is between 0.4~0.5.Take the bacterial liquid out from the shaker.Spin briefly to bring the sample to the bottom before reacting:The recommended amount of vector for recombination reaction is 0.03 pmol.Mix completely and gently.Heat shock: put the mixture in 42? water bath for 90s.Get the mixture out from the water bath and put it immediately on ice for 2mins.Recovery: add 500?l LB medium, culture for 1~2h in shaker.Please see Page 5 for instructions.Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute at room temperature.Centrifuge the empty HiBind\u00ae DNA Mini Column for 2 minutes at maximum speed to dry the column matrix.Note: It is important to dry the HiBind\u00ae DNA Mini Column matrix before elution.With temperature of 37? and rate of 220rpm.We used Plasmid Mini-prep Kit from Biomiga(PD1213-01).We just post the protocols here with some advice:Inoculate 5-12 mL LB containing appropriate antibiotic with a fresh colony.Make the ligand solution: Glucose was diluted to 1 ? M from 2 M stock using 1x PBS, and the final concentrations were 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200mM; Epinephrine was made 1mM stock in 0.1mM HAc and diluted to concentrations 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100?M; in mimic patient\u0092s urine sample tests, ligands were dissolved in urine from healthy individuals .Culture under 37? overnight.Prepare 15ml test tube, add 5ml LB medium and 5?l Amp (final concentration

at detecting disease.\u0094 He said, \u0093What the government attaches importance to is gene engineering on food and biological agent.\u0094 On account of this, there\u0092s actually no administration or law that we could follow.In order to avoid irrelevant usage, we made a detailed instruction, and we also developed an app to give guidance.When one gene product is brought to the environment, it\u0092s always the toxin it takes that counts.Therefore we don\u0092t need to worry about the gene we introduced into yeast.Based on China\u0092s risk evaluation, the influence on humans should include these two aspects: clinical treatment risk and immunogenicity (Kai X. et al., 2016).As Professor Shi mentioned, the method we used must be \u0093traceless\u0094, which means we can\u0092t change the structure of the protein it expresses.Therefore it\u0092s not likely that they could cause adverse reactions if one touch these yeasts carelessly.To make sure it can be brought to the public, a risk assessment was done.Nevertheless, in our project, as we have said above, there\u0092s no toxic change for itself, and certainly no for the environment.Moreover, as Professor Shi pointed out, Chinese government hasn\u0092t published any administration for biological products which specifically aimed at detection.We solved the problem by developing the freeze-dry preservation method.Once a biological product goes to the market, it\u0092s hard to predict what it will become.So our project actually doesn\u0092t have such problems.To know more and get instructions of laws and risk assessments, we interviewed Professor Shi J., an expert of risk assessment and biosafety in School of Bioscience and Biotechnology of SJTU.According to administrative provisions [1][2] and essays related to such provisions [3], Chinese government attaches great importance to the following three parts.The quality of one biological product is related to many aspects.Unfortunately, we haven\u0092t found an effective method.Since our project is building a biosensor, and it won\u0092t get in touch with humans, there\u0092s little possibility that it will cause adverse reactions.Anyone who do a certain work for the first time, there must be a team mate who can do it practically standing beside, watching him and giving instructions.On advance of Professor Shi\u0092s proposal (See more in \u0093interview\u0094 below), we proposed a general biosafety risk assessment.Only when our project becomes into product and is having clinical test will we need to think highly of the risks it may bring.As for the second one, because our biosensor could be used only once, the time should be that between it is produced and it is used.Luckily, the microorganism used in our project is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the most common yeast which has successfully been manufactured.It\u0092s illegal to simply let it alone.\u0094When we asked about risk assessment, he told us there\u0092s not much to worry about.As for gene change in yeast, there\u0092s also not much to worry about.So we are confident to the preservation and transport procedure.On advance of these three databases, we made a risk assessment below.Manufacturing of biological products includes culturing, fermentation, purification and packing.Professor Shi (left) and his workmate (right)Before starting any work in the lab, all of our team members should be aware of the safety and security process.As for a biosensor, the most critical part should be the accuracy of the result and the time it can maintain its function.When we do some experiments, there\u0092re also some graduated students besides.We have tried to think of a useful way to acquire further data if it is finally presented to the public.The temperature of culturing, the time of fermentation and the technology used to purify, even a single change will make a difference.Luckily, we did the first by controlling its density and establishing linkages between its density and illumination value.\u0093But of course you cannot do such further,\u0094 he smiled.As for our project, he pointed out that we must control the density of yeast every time we detect the illumination intensity.\u0093But as a project which uses active organisms,\u0094 he said, \u0093you must make sure you have the ability to deal with it after it is used.Clinical treatment risks include untoward effect under normal dosage, like allergy, and irrelevant dosage, while immunogenicity refers to the ability to stimulate one organism to form specific antibodies, especially allergic ones.This was all done in accordance with the instruction of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Assets Management Bureau, which is responsible for biological safety matter.What we have brought into yeast is GPCR, a kind of receptor protein.Each process can influence the final quality of the product.Since the biosensor we build can give its result without touching

"", "description": "Platinum resources are draining and if recycling methods are not developed, the world could run out of platinum in the upcoming 50 years.As a result of emissions from automobile catalytic converters there are high concentrations of platinum deposited in the soil next to highways and big roads, often higher than in mines.There is an issue with industrial wastewater treatment, minerals and metals accumulate so much that companies discard it instead of using decontamination treatment.Purify the Platinum from other metals or inorganic compounds.Transform it into a highly desirable form - nanoparticles.It is hard to imagine applying modern industrial methods as a solution for recycling the platinum in the soil of big highways.Here, the platinum catalyses oxidation and reduction reactions that neutralize toxic gases emitted during combustion.Platinum is a rare metal because there are only a few mines in the world where it can be obtained.Platinum concentrations are high in plants cause of the treatment of rainwater which is charged with metals et minerals.Platinum is a dense, malleable, ductile, precious and highly unreactive transition metal.The benefit of using the biosorption is to obtain nanoparticles of platinum, a highly valuable form of the metal.Thanks to its catalytic properties and remarkable resistance to corrosion even in high temperatures, it is a highly desired metal.Platinum is widely used in laboratory equipment, platinum resistance thermometers, electrical contacts and electrodes, medical equipment, chemotherapy, jewelry and etc.But most importantly platinum is used as the main catalyst in catalytic converters.An alternative solution to mining could help in the resolution of this issue.Concentrate the platinum accumulated in plants because of phytoremediation or in sludge in rainwater treatment centers.Secondly, there are no current methods of recycling platinum from accumulations in the environment that have been shown to work.Finally, there are also various socio medical complications associated with platinum mining.A modified FliC protein complex will be cloned into E. coli and enable the flagella of the bacterium so that it can bind platinum atoms.In fact since the 90s a legislation has been passed making platinum containing catalytic converters mandatory for all cars in most parts of the world.During the process of extraction huge amounts of hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used to eliminate impurities.Most importantly, platinum resources are draining.If we could exploit these systems and target platinum specifically enough, we could find a durable, simple, cheap and environmentally friendly solution.The main goal of our project is to concentrate the platinum as much as possible.The first step relies on the affinity of small organic molecules, siderophores, to bind solubilized Platinum atoms and thus favor the further solubilisation of more platinum compounds.As a second level of concentrating the platinum even more, we plan to use the principle of biosorption.", "design": "To counter this potential issue, we regulate transcription using the arabinose inductible promoter, pBAD/araCIt has to be noted that the siderophore here is specific for platinum but the same cloning could be performed with siderophores specific for others metals, thus our process presents a great potential as it can be applied to others metals thanks to synthetic biology and its modularity.Our strategy for the siderophore mobilisation results in two main steps\u00a0: Siderophores binding the platinum ions and others metallic ions1.A simple centrifugation of the flagellin binding the platinum allows to concentrate the metal a second time.? J. de Aberasturi, et al., Minerals Engineering 24, 505 (2011)? P.S Hooda & al.Moreover, any alternative has been found so far to counteract the disparition of this metal compared to its central importance in many industries (electronic, automobile, medical..) .Facing this problem, our goal here is to make a sustainable process, extracting platinum from an other source (road, sludge) than mines ressources, less pollutant, less expensive..Accumulation of the metal on the road side has been frequently shown since the beginning of the 21st century.Importation of the siderophore complexed with the platinum in StreptomycesBiosorption and reduction using flagellin and peptides Adsorption of the platinum on the bacterial surface, Capeness & al.Here, we use the adsorption potentiel of bacterial natural componants (specifically flagellum and biopeptides) to make a process able to extract or concentrate the platinum available on different compartiments like soil, plants, sewege sludge...  Maquette of our process in the futur\u00a0: Process has been imagined in a circular platinum economy based on the sludge treatment.Though, valuable ashes obtained would be treated by both steps we made\u00a0: the first one is a siderophore treatment making a first concentration of the platinum and other metals, the second one is a flagellin treatment allowing to make industrialisable platinum.To obtain a high transcription level of this sequence, we put transcription control under a strong promoter enabling a high flagellin production.Next, the flagellin produced will be added to the first concentrated platinum solution.During the automobile functioning, the precious metal is rejected and deposed on the road under a ionic form [2][3] Platinum leaching leads to an accumulation of this metal on the road side.Induction and production of the desferrioxamine B.Then, the produced siderophore would be purified and transfered in the recuperation solution containing the platinum and other metals.http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-012-0491-3.? Improving recoveries of platinum and palladium from oxidized Platinum-group element ores of the Great Dyke, Zimbabwe, using the biogenic siderophore Desferrioxamine B, Dennis Kraemer & al.2015 Adsorption of the platinum on the flagellum, Deplenche & al.[8] reduce ions into reduced nanoparticles by the ambient reducer powerAll together, these findings incite us to use these natural properties to build a biobrick which is a high affinity binder of platinum based on E. coli and Desulfovibrio vulgaris flagellum and synthetic peptides.By this way, they extracted approximately 80% of the total platinum found in the ore.By default, it has been prooved that plants are potential bioaccumulator of platinum, which is found accumulated on the roots, leaves or into them.Platinum found on the water retention basin is recovered and incinerated.2008It was shown that proteins are able to bind platinium and especially bacterial flagellums which are naturally a high platinum adsorber [6][7] Furthermore, many peptides were generated based on sequences selected by phage display in order to enhance metal ions adsorption including gold, silver, platinum and a plenty of other metals.Then, on the part of the flagellin facing the external medium, an insertion restriction site will be inserted.Otherwise, the metal is also carried on the sewage sludge and is actually an issue regarding the recycling potential of these sludge.In the previous article [4], authors made bioleaching with chemically synthetised siderophores.And then the platinum come back to it first form and can be recycle and the cycle begin, the cycle of platinum!.Since a law from 1993, platinum is largely used in catalytic converter to avoid toxic gaz release [1].Flagellin containing specific peptides will bind the free or available ions in the medium and reduce them into reduced nanoparticules usable in industry.In consequence, treated sludge are depolluted from metal and can be spreaded on the crops making an additional valorization.Specifically, many articles showed a high affinity of Desferrioxamine B ( produce by Streptomyces coelicolor) for tetravalent metal ions and more specifically platinum.These results encouraged us to make a biobrick coding the sequence corresponding to the 4 enzymes involved on the metabolic pathway of Desferrioxamine B. E. coli was used to produce this biobrick.To this end, we analyze the flagella sequences and structural properties of the external part of the flagella.", "human_practice": "This made us realize that many of the problems we had highlighted related to platinum have existed throughout the history of mankind: pollution, ownership of resources, work conditions, availability...We considered the implications for platinum and metals recycling our process could have, asked experts for advice and researched where it could fit in the industrial sector.This work can be found on the Integrated Practices page.The interactions we had here was really more focused in the scientific aspect of our project.As we investigated on the wide range of available techniques able to perform our purpose (recover platinum) we wonder what would be the imperative in our process...Indeed we made us discover a wide range of already existing environmental processes that could be followed by our process.Thanks to all those people we had very interesting interactions which contributed to the final shape of our project!Moreover our project was very well received by public and our conversations with people coming from different backgrounds was really motivating for us!We also shared our project with people more familiar with biology and biotechnology.Popularizing our project was really interesting and new for us because we had to find new ways to explain synthetic biology and our project.Moreover his recommendations has shape our project as we focused on the platinum recovery from sewage sludge which is a very advantageous process financially speaking.Finally we shared and did popularization on our project by attending to meetings, events and in medias (website, radio, local written press).We presented the synthetic biology toolbox to the general public, and talked about how it could be applied to solve environmental problems such as in those in our project.That why we contacted a expert in process engineering and biotechnology to advise us to determine the feasibility of our project.He showed us to what extend the situation could be critical about metals pollution, that why we found our project relevant.Hence he was really interested in our project we could have had fruitful conversations...The main question that we wondered was how to transpose our process initially designed on a laboratory scale to the industrial scale.We got advise from an expert in process engineering and biotechnology, to construct and define our process and to understand the current industrial possibilities available to biotechnology.We asked the University of Pretoria iGEM team to investigated for us the social issues and conditions of platinum mining, by interviewing experts.We had many fruitful conversations with an ecological engineer who advised us about the current situation and environmental pollution.We wondered if the different social issues around platinum were characteristic to our century and to what extent such issues could have mattered in the past.Thanks to him we have been able to assess and estimate representative values of our project applied on a industrial scale (such as, yields, cost, prices, concentration factors, amount of raw materials needed .....).", "modeling": "Then the matrices and functions $\beta$, $gamma$,$p(mathbf{z,z ,c}) $ need to be defined for the problem considered.Finally the inital conditions $W_{mathbf{Z}}(mathbf{z},t)$ and$mathbf{c}_0 $ and growth conditions $D$ and $mathbf{c}_f $ need to beFor the problem in hand, plasmid maintenance during growth with 2different plasmids, and attempting to find a simple solution to theproblem we propose a 3 variable internal state vector:$$mathbf{z} = \begin{bmatrix} z_0 \\ z_1 \\ z_2 end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\textrm{Cell maturity} \\ \textrm{count of plasmid 1} \\ \textrm{count of plasmid 2} end{bmatrix}$$In this internal state vector: $z_0$ is a mesure of the growth of thebacteria, encompassing such things as size, number of chromosomes andmass; $z_1$ and $z_2$ represent the number of copies of each plasmid.For the external conditions we propose simply the substrateconcentration $S$.In particular we are interested infinding how the number of bacteria without plasmids $W_{mathbf{Z}}([z_0,0,0],t)$ in the culture progresses, and how this depends on the various parameters in the model.We need to introduce a modification to equation 3 (the state dependantgrowth rate) in which the equilibrium between $z_1$ and $z_2$ features.This modification is to take into account that each toxin should beinhibited by anti-toxin for maximal growth.[2] to include 2 plasmids and incorporate the cell dot{z}_0 (mathbf{z},S) = mu = mu _{max} frac{S}{K_S+S}

replication rate we propose, again following Shene et k_1 frac{mu (mathbf{z},S)}{K_1 + mu (mathbf{z},S)} ( z_{1_{max}} - z_1 ) & \text{if } z_1 geq 1.0 \\This relation, and equivalent one for plasmid

we assume that there is a fixed rate of division$sigma $ once cells are big enough to divide ($H[]$ is the Heaviside p(mathbf{z,z ,c}) = p(z_0,z _0) \times p(z_1,z _1) \times p(z_2,z _2) p(z_0,z _0) =

environment by a cell in state $mathbf{z}$ .Thus for a particular problem in hand it is necessary to chose$mathbf{z}$ and $mathbf{c}$ that represent the state of cells and themedia.The inhibition constant reduces plasmid replication rate at$\bar{dot{mathbf{V}}}(mathbf{z,c})$ rather than $\beta $ and$\bar{mathbf{R}}(mathbf{z,c})$.The bacteria beingindependant ensures that the behaviour of each individual depends onlyon its internal state $mathbf{z}$ and the conditions $mathbf{c}$ whichare the same for all individuals.mu &= mu_{0} \times e^{-frac{[Toxin]}{IC_{50}}} \\ mu &= mu_{0} \times min(1.0,e^{-k_a(z_1-k_bz_2)}) \\Incorporating 2 toxin anti toxin pairs, if we assumethat the production rate ratio is the same for both, $k_b$, is mu = mu_{0} \times min(1,e^{-k_a(z_1-k_bz_2)})) \times min(1,e^{-k_a(z_2-k_bz_1)}))where $mu_0$ is given by equation 3.These assumptions are probably the most suspectThis initial version of the model has no contention, that is $z_1$ and$z_2$ do not influence the growth rate $mu $.The aim of the model is to assess the evolution of plasmids throughout the culture, to determine which parameters can matter in the loss of those plasmids, and to precise what are the probabilities for a bacteria to loose its plasmids during cell division.As a plasmids can be a disadvantage for growth (energy spent into replicating processes) or a advantage (protection against a toxin) this question is hard to answer.We can see that with D increasing, corresponding to more bacteria growing, more bacteria tend to lose their plasmids and to have various numbers of plasmid.These results can be interpreted by the fact that if D is increasing, thus $\u00b5$ also increases, then bacteria grow faster, and divide faster.With small values of D, bacteria grow slowly and all plasmids have time to be replicated between each cell division.That is why for these values, most bacteria still have maximum values of plasmids and are all in the same situation hence the focusing of the plot for small values of D.If D is higher time for each bacteria to replicate their plasmids between each division is reduced, and the situation of each individual bacteria becomes different, explaining the scattering on the plot.A possibility is that we the genes produce toxin at a constant rate dependant on the numberof copies $k_1\times z_1$, the anti-toxin genes produce anti-toxin at a rate dependant on the number of copies $k_2\times z_2$, anti-toxin instantly and irreversible kills the toxin in a stochiometric manner.But in this situation, where one type of plasmid can influence on the presence of the other type of plasmid in (and reciprocally) in the same bacteria, the question become too tough to answer and only a mathematical model can resolve such a interrogation!In 1967 Fredrickson et al.The maturity parameter has a minimum value of 1 andFor the rates of change of the internal state vector then we propose forthe bacterial maturity to extend the development presented in Shene etal.Of course other factor have shown impact as replication rate of plasmids and the relative toxicity of each toxin.growth in inhibited in an exponential manner by free toxin with a characteristic $IC_{50}$.This model of toxin anti-toxin interaction takes into account thebacteriostatic nature of most such toxins, and the presence ofmeasurable $IC_{50}$ values.plasmids 1 carry the toxin A gene and the anti-toxin B gene plasmids 2 carry the toxin B gene and the anti-toxin A geneSo during the growth each bacterium can have no plasmids, either one type of plasmids, or both types.That cells divide exactly in half, thatis the maturity parameter is exactly halved when the cells divide($delta$ is a Kronecker delta function).The volume is well mixed so theconditions $mathbf{c}$ which are the same everywhere.This show that one of the main factor influencing the loss of plasmid is the growth of bacteria.", "notebook": "Transformation of DH5? cells

confronting them with previously isolatedHowever, our project needed our Myxobacteria to be confronted with fungus isolated from crops.The ones that we were interested in were the white ones, since these are the ones that have what we want correctly inserted; the pink ones are the backbones that were not correctly digested and ligated and thus are of no use for us.Because of this there were two types of colonies in the plates where our transformed cells were plated: pink and white.We transformed E. coli with each of our BioBricks\u0099 to increase the quantity of DNA we had, then we extracted the plasmid of each one of them so we could make the assembly.In our visits to the crop fields, we collected some samples of infected alfalfa.The first attempt to build our BioBrick\u0099 consisted in the assembly of eight different parts.Since not everything is digested and ligated properly during the assembly, there are some backbones without the insert that can interfere.Other confrontations were performed against uncharacterized fungi only to challenge Myxobacteria.We wanted to know for sure what was the reason of the infection and what part of the plant its attacked.Our

following way.We can conclude that the uricase mixture made with our engineered E. coli has an ability to process uric acid with theoretically maximum rate of 3.1ng/(?L*min).Accoding to our modeling, a large amount of Uricase may be needed to solve the problem of birds\u0092 dropping.We couldn\u0092t confirm this enzyme catalyzes uric acid into allantoin.The growth ability of the recombinant E. coli in minimal media containing uric acidGrowth test in minimal media of wild type E. coli and the recombinant E. coli were conducted to confirm Uricase activity which was expressed by the recombinant E. coli.In SDS-PAGE experiment, there is a high possibility that Uricase of B. subtilis was synthesized by the recombinant E. coli.The strongest band of lane 6 (less than 31 kDa) was not thought as uricase because of the difference from correct molecular weight (38.7 kDa).In addition, we tried?the purification by His-tag, only to fail (no purification product was seen) because that uricase from B. subtilis hardly dissolve in PBS buffer we used (shown above Figure)E. coli culuture were grown in the presence of IPTG.The result is shown in Figure.16 Even though the activity is lower than reagent Uricase, the activity of Uricase which expressed by our recombinant E. coli can be detected.In this project, we assayed mainly device BBa_ K2158004.However, in the growth test, the recombinant E. coli didn\u0092t grow well with uric acid.In determination of the recombinant Uricase, the result shows the possibility of expressed functional protein catalyze uric acid to allantoin.Then we put the proportionality constant as Kcat.Here, we estimated the two kinetic parameters Vmax and Km in the equation by fitting these parameters to a measurement result of the concentration change of uric acid in the reaction mixture.We performed growth test in minimal media containing purines of E. coli, B. subtilis, S.cerevisiae to confirm the existence of the target gene.The blue curve means the fitted curve, and the red plots is the data obtained from the experiment.The concentration of uricase as a standard reagent wasNow two kinetic parameters which is independent of concentration of enzyme or substrate (Kcat and Km) were estimated.Second, we conducted His-Link purification of protein and measured the absorbance at 280.0 nm to determine the concentration of uricase in the cell lysate.After that, we degraded urea and assayed the releasing ammonia by the method mentioned above.The growth tests in minimal media containing purines of B. subtilis , S. cerevisiae were performed.We attached the source code of this fitting tool below.In the following data and description, the unit of concentration of any substances is ng/?L and the unit of time is minute.First, we measured the change of concentration of uric acid in the reaction mixture.To acheive this goal, we manufactured E. coli that synthesizes uricase, which catalyzes uric acid to urea.In addition, we measured Uricase activity and concluded that there was a possibility that the synthesized Uricase has activity.However, Candida utilis has the gene coded uricase which has high enzyme activity.)Vmax is the conversion rate of uric acid under the condition that the ratio of the amount of uric acid to that of uricase is sufficiently high.E. coli culture was sonicated and diluted 1 to 100 times with the borate buffer.We could\u0092t understand why this incident happened.Determination of recombinant Uricase in the supernatant and the precipitationIn Figure.12, we considered that expressed Uricase is mainly in the precipitation.Yasuji Koyama, Toshio Ichikawa, Eiichi Nakano (1996) Cloning, Sequence Analysis, and Expression in Escherichia coli of the Gene Encoding the Candida utilis Urate Oxidase (Uricase).So, we cloned genes of uricase, allantoinase and allantoicase into E. coli to assess production and activity of these three enzymes.For this reason, the conversion rate of uric acid is described with the Michaelis-Menten equation.But we found that only Uricase derived from B. subtilis was in the recombinant E. coli .We performed PCR amplification of the genes coding these enzymes and cloned into E. coli.Uricase in this solution was synthesized by E. coli which we engineered.Uric acid in the reaction mixture may be catalyzed into allantoin.We combined Figure.13 and Figure.15.B. subtilis can degrade all of five intermediates of uric degradation described above.According to James and Rudolf(1984), wild type S. pombe is capable of degrading uric acid and allantoin.The result of the measurement is summerized in , Table.1 and Figure.11 .Then, we inputted these data into the parameter fitting tool mentioned above.So, we assayed Uricase in the supernatant and the precipitation of the sonicated cell suspension respectively and tried to verify the activity of the Uricase.Therefore, we are interested in \"How fast can our E. coli process uric acid theoretically?\"So, it is not clear that this protein has the function.We can utilize expressed enzymes without sonication.Schulz AC,Nygaard P,Saxild HH(2001)Functional analysis of 14 genes

were continuously measured.E. coli has a gene of allantoinase, and we can consider the possibility of affecting assay.(Protocols)The result of absorbance change is shown in Fig.15.We think IPTG didn\u0092t control lactose operon efficiently and the amount of the expressed enzyme was not enough to grow in the medium.We could extract genome from three kinds of bacteria, B. subtilis, S.cerevisiae and S. pombe and express three enzymes mentioned above.Meanwhile, this year\u0092s result is not enough to solve the pollution of droppings.In the city, deterioration of the landscape caused by birds\u0092 droppings is also a serious problem.Our goal of this project is to solve problems caused by birds\u0092 droppings with genetically engineered E. coli.Thirdly, each gene is cloned into B. subtilis instead of E. coli .So, we plan to solve these problems by expression of birds\u0092 \"dropping cleanerase\" and degrading uric acid.Purine metabolism is a pathway of synthesizing and degrading purines.If we use the gene coded uricase of Candida utilis by total synthesis, our project will improve more.Ammonia, the final product of purine metabolism, is the most assimilated nitrogen source of most fungi and bacteria.According to the sequence data, deletion of one base happened and it changed the reading frame in this composite part.Output of the parameter fitting was as follows.Besides, this graph shows the result of parameter fitting.As template genes of Uricase, Allantoinase and Allantoicase, we used four microorganisms.These crude extractions were diluted 1 to 100 times with the borate buffer.Ukai is a traditional night fishing method in which an \"usho\"(Cormorant Fishing Master) and \"u\"(cormorant birds) work together to fish by the flames of Kagari-bi (fishing fire lanterns) reflecting on the dark surface of the river, with Mt Kinka and lofty Gifu Castle on its summit providing a dramatic backdrop to the scenery.Furthermore, E. coli has a special anaerobic pathway to decompose allantoin into urea.The final concentration of the enzyme is 0.417 ng/?L.However, BBa_B0015 was not included in the plasmid.As expected, Bacillus subtilis grew well with uric acid, allantoin and ammonium sulfate.Uricase was cloned from B. subtilis and S. pombe.In Gifu prefecture, Cormorant Fishing on the Nagara river (Ukai) is one of the most summer sights in Japan.B. subtilis has eight genes driving uric acid degradation.However, it didn\u0092t grow well with w/o ammonium, uric acid and ammonium sulfate.0.5 mL of distilled water was added and the mixture was preheated at 25?.Cormorant is carnivorous animal, and the amount of uric acid in their droppings are larger than that of uric acid in other birds\u0092 droppings.We prepared 0.001% uric acid solution by dissolving in 50.0 mmol/L borate buffer containing 1.0 mmol/L EDTA and detergent(pH8.5).On the other hand, damage caused by the cormorant droppings at the riverside is serious in Japan.We assayed the degradation of uric acid by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 290 nm.In kegg pathway of purine metabolism in E. coli, it has HIU hydrolase and Allantoinase.We added 0.125 mg of urease in the reaction mixture.Birds\u0092 excrement consists mainly of uric acid which is hardly soluble material.No significant differences were observed in minimal media with 2 mM uric acid and w/o ammonium.Minimal media containing 2 mM urate or allantoin or ammonium sulfate as a sole nitrogen source and minimal media not containing nitrogen sources were also prepared.Firstly, we have to do more accurate assay using the allantoinase-loss-strain of E. coli.Cell suspensions were incubated at the appropriate temperatures for one day and spotted onto LB broth or YPD broth.A tool which estimates and outputs Vmax and Km by entering the measurement results of the concentration change was developed.E. coli culture was sonicated to assay the enzyme.The equation we made is as follows.d [uric acid] / dt = - Vmax * [uric acid] / (Km + [Uric acid])\u0085(A)([X] represents the concentration of a substance X.In woods on the riverside inhabited by cormorant, some leaves are stained with their droppings and interfered with photosynthesis.James R. Kinghorn, Rudolf Fluri (1984) Genetic studies of purine breakdown in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.So, we used B. subtilis and S. pombe in place of that.We couldn\u0092t verify the difference between E. coli with device BBa_K2158003 and wild type E. coli.So, we concluded the expressed Allantoicase didn t have appropriate function to degrade allantoic acid.Enzyme solution was mixed with buffer for allantoinase(50.0 mM Hepes, pH 7.75) containing 45.0 mM allantoin and incubated at 37?.", "design": "", "human_practice": "After the presentation, we conducted a field survey to

and synthesize biology.As a result of before survey Q1, Q2 and Q3, the recognition of the genetic recombination technology was very high, but the recognition of the synthesize biology was very low.In addition, when we compared the result of the before survey Q5 and the after survey Q4, we understood how students have impression of a product using the genetic recombination technology.In the field survey, we found some birds\u0092 droppings under some utility poles, but we weren\u0092t able to find the terribly polluted place.However, the city officer and local resident told that there were some polluted places and many wild birds in Echizen city few years ago.We were requested a presentation about the activity of iGEM Gifu by Ogakikita senior high school which is specified in the super

science club of Gifu Kita High School.Survey of the Droppings damage in Echizen city, Fukui prefecture\u00a0In recent years, urbanization in Japan is advanced, so the environment has changed.The purpose was to get the recognition and understanding about genetic recombination technology and synthesize biology in the society.So, it is thought that the future problem in the study on synthesize biology is to prove the unknown risk, and to secure safety based on it.In the before survey, the favorable answer to food was 63%, cosmetics was 18% and medicine was 45%.However, in the after survey, the favorable answer to food was 50%, cosmetics was 18% and medicine was 83%.So, we thought that the season of our survey was not suitable.But, there were many opinions that they worry about safety for the food.We therefore made a presentation in Echizen city because we thought that our study could help to solve the problem.To give some basic background information, there are some places in Echizen city that are polluted due to birds\u0092 droppings.We should conduct the survey, when the wild birds were active.Survey of the damage associated with birds in Gifu cityWe confirmed whether the dropping (uric acid) is decomposed by the constructed E. coli which has a gene coding uricase.So, we found that the impression of genetically modified food was not so good in the society.Therefore, it has been an increase in the Droppings damage in urban areas.And also, high school students presented their study.The following graphs are the results of the questionnaires.And

however we decided to do a miniprep of the CUP1 codon optimized gene in order to do the restriction digest and gel the next experiment day.Copper measurements were taken through the use of a different plate reader.An overnight for the Ret1 transformed cells was done today to repeat the experiment at higher concentrations of copper.First meeting of the project over summer where we ran our PCR products on a 1% agarose gel for practice.Enough volume of the 0.1M Copper Solution was added to the 6 six flasks so each of the control and transformed group will have flasks containing a concentration of [0uM], [15uM] and [25uM].Discussion of the gel results and future plans on how copper measurement will be done.A gel was run on the transformed cells and control cells using Bullseye (left) and EtBr (right) to stain the DNA.We ran an SDS-PAGE gel using the samples collected from the experiment we did on August 19th.After realizing that the copper solution was interfering with our OD data, we decided to resuspend the cells in LB and use LB as our blank to gather the OD data.We ran an inoculation experiment using the cells with the CUP1 codon-optimized gene.Gel results showed no bands Digestion of the metallothionein plasmid with restriction enzymes (EcoRI & PstI).This gel showed a band in the Ret2 samples at a size of around 32 kDa, while our Metallothionein protein was expected to be around 6.5 kDa.The control plate had only a few colonies growing on it, even after a second attempt while the transformed had multiple colonies.We also ran two more gels with the experiment for Ret1 data.Another inoculation experiment was scheduled for today, however the tube of the overnight cells broke so instead a repeat of the overnight was done.After the optical density was read for the solution, the solutions were centrifuged and the supernatant in the eppendorfs were removed to be used for copper measurement.Repeated analysis of the digestion products on the gel.An overnight will be done tomorrow for the experiment on the following day.We noticed that we had to create different blanks due to the different copper concentrations that we did not do for the previous experiments.Since the Laemmli Buffer was nowhere to be found,the solution was spun down to be put in the freezer for the SDS gel in the future.Meeting with our advisor regarding current updates on the project and the availability of the flame atomic absorption spectrometer to be used for the copper measurement.Data was collected in the same manner except with a 30 minute time point after the one hour mark.Six flasks of 25 mL LB broth were prepared, 3 of which will be the control and the other will be for the transformed.We also discussed team structure and the CUP1 gene construct that is needed to be synthesized as a G-block.Based on the lanes with the least amount of noise (colonies 7 and 8), we transformed our competent cells using the DNA corresponding to those colonies.The control was spread on plates with ampicilin resistance and the transformed group was spread on plates with chloramphenicol resistance.To the transformed group 9.375uL of Chloramphenicol was added.The pellet in the eppendorfs were then resuspended with 200uL of master mix of Laemmli Buffer and were placed in the freezer to be used to run an SDS-gel in the future.At every hour for eight hours, starting at the 0th hour, an optical density reading will be taken for each flask.Drawing out 1mL of the solution from each flask into eppendorfs, followed by measuring the optical density.After further investigation, the Bulls-Eye solution was the cause of bands not appearing and we switched to Ethidium Bromide.iGEM team members attended a meeting with a professor and was given an overview to the procedure of 3A Assembly.7 uL of the Sigma Aldrich Wide Range Ladder (6-205 kDA) was added to the first lane while the other 10 lanes each contained 10 uL of samples from the experiment.From the second inoculation experiment, the eppendorfs were thawed on ice in preparation for the 10% SDS-gel.The second method uses a plate reader to measure the florescence of the sample.The second iGEM part, CUP1 codon optimized came in the day prior.The plate reader could not measure the florescence because there were no appropriate filters in the lab to emit higher than 700nm.Repeated digestion to troubleshoot any possible errors that may have occurred during the protocol.Today marks the first day we began production of our first cell line, Retriever 1(Ret1).The CUP1 transformed cells and control cells were plated and an overnight was done.The digestion products were then run on a gel stained with ethidium bromide.From Copper Sulfate, a stock solution of 0.5M Copper Solution was

assess whether there was an alteration in wavelength of the light output in these bacteria compared to bacteria contained an unaltered LUXoperon.Co-expression: Express the LUXoperon and mKeima in different bacterial cells and assess whether the Fluorescence by Unbound Excitation from Luminescence (FUEL) reaction was able to cause a change in the wavelength of the light output.We hoped to show that blue light produced by E.coli expressing the native LUXoperon would excite the mKeima protein resulting in the emission of red light.As a link to our use of luciferases in the Cas-Find project we developed an interest in biological imaging.One challenge in the field of biological imaging is in the use of fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins that emit light with longer wavelengths.The mKeima RFP variant has been previously used as a long stoke shifted fluorophore and was the subject of the SPECTRA project of the 2013 UCL iGEM team.Therefore as a side project we planned to alter the potential usage of the Lux Operon biobrick (Cambridge iGEM 2010 BBa_K325909) by inducing a red-shift in its bioluminescence via an interaction with the mKeima protein.", "design": "", "human_practice": "The design of our Cas-Find project and its intended future usage has evolved as we delved into the complex issues that surround the design and implementation of a self-testing STI diagnostic tool.This affected the planning of our Cas-Find project, providing the impetus for the ultimate design of a cell-free system in the final proposed diagnostic tool.From this, we consulted the MHRA, which gave us an insight into the criteria used to assess the safety of a medical device before it is approved.This led to seeking empirical data on BioSure s HIV self testing kits by contacting employees at the HIV charities, Terrence Higgins Trust (Emily Rosselli) and National Aids Trust (Nadia Ramjhun).All of these strands evolved into a final essay to inform our decision making when considering whether Cas-Find should be applied for use in a self-testing kit.Dr Jillian Craigie- Ethicist at Kings College LondonNadia Ramjhun- National Aids Trust for leading us to a resourceEmily Rosselli- Terrence Higgins Trust for leading us to a resourceAs we had a luciferase expert as our secondary PI, Dr Amit Jathoul, we decided to investigate how we could use a split luciferase system as part of our diagnostic tool.Luciferase Diagnostics Expert- false positives and hardwareDuring the planning stages, we had an informal chat with Dr Patrick Hardinge, a diagnostics researcher at Cardiff University, who works with Lumora, a diagnostic company who have designed a tool using luciferase and BART amplification to detect specific bacterial food contamination.This fed into the design of our use of dual guide RNAs in our CRISPR-Cas9 experimental system that eventually became the Cas-Find project.He also helped us think about the future product that Cas-Find may eventually become by recommending that we kept a cheap photodiode in our plans when designing the output mechanism for the tool.Patrick was full of useful advice, stressing that the reduction of false positives should be a vital component of our design, recommending that we should adopt a system that requires two independent events to bring about a  positive  result.Risk Assessments, GM regulation, and regulatory bodies After a two-week process of risk assessments through various channels, our application to take live bacterial samples expressing luciferase proteins out to Techniquest for an outreach event was rejected by Rachel Coombe, a Biological Safety Officer at Cardiff University.Surveys, ethics, social work, HIV charitiesMeanwhile, Asal investigated the ethics of using a tool such as Cas-Find as a self-testing kit, spurred on by a conversation on  burying results  and  pre-test counselling  with a retired HIV social worker, Emily Engel.She advised us that cell-free kits are easier to license, and stressed the importance of regulatory bodies, such as the HSE and, more specific to our project, the MHRA.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Asal and Rob focusing on making lux plates while others worked on Cas-Find, and (later on) Rob following up on FLIM work), creating Gantt charts, Asal taking on Human Practices solo, and another delivery delay which evened it all out.In H.P., we hosted our first outreach event, with a stall at a STEM event at our university, allowing us to reach out to prospective students and introduce them to iGEM and international science.Finally, a stroke of luck ended up with Cardiff being invited to EE16, a European meet-up of iGEM teams hosted by iGEM IONIS, so Chris and David got to spend a weekend away in Paris while the rest of the team stayed in sunny exotic Wales to present a stall at a second STEM open day, this time with an interactive display with glow in the dark plates.Team members who went to Paris wont stop talking about itAfter a hectic weekend in international outreach at EE16 Paris, it was back to the grind - running the guide RNA parts from MP to transformation into pColaDuet & SB1C\u00a3 in one week, a coordinated effort made possible through the training and planning so far.Lab work was less of a team effort for each stage - each man working as much as each pair was in the initial weeks.A welcome addition to the team, Laura came back from a marine biology project in Tobago, and promptly showed everyone up by immediately integrating into the wet lab team and proved a quick study.As we were getting into our stride and our transformations started stacking up, we were soon drowning in eppendorfs, and the freezer shelf looked more like a school locker than a lab shelf.In a few cases it was human error, but we discovered more problems with our protocols, and a the week after we found out a full third of our constructs were doomed from the startHuzzah!On the bright side, we had a whole week to finish our FUEL improvement, and with the whole wet lab team on the job (instead of just Rob) we made rapid headway and were ready to PCR over the weekend.The team were once again invited to a meetup, this time Westminster.The rest of us carried on with our work - Asal, now primarily focused on Human Practices, was starting to get replies from professionals on the viability & necessity of our diagnostic tool, while Chris and Nik worked through the wet lab load.At this point as well we reflected on our progress so far, and moved to align ourselves to achieving our aims.As the event winded down, we approached the award ceremony with little trepidation - we were proud of our work, and compared to our experience in doing iGEM, any recognition of this would be enough.Miniprep yields were improving, the Chemists finally stopped calling the incubator  the oven , and we successfully did our first solo transformation (pet16b into C3019H competent cells).Not only this, but we managed to get in touch with the Cardiff University PR officer to discuss ideas about how to promote ourselves.The next time we would all be together was Boston in 3 months time, and whilst that seems an age, when you have a wiki to write it passes in an instant -_-Only team member who can draw is away for the drawing partGot signatures from over 40 teams from 6 continents!A robot, a lobster and an FBI agent walk into a conference...It was all leading to this.With our guides and spilt luciferase cloned into pET16b (or so we thought), we set about on troubleshooting our PCRs - we were skeptical of the official guides, and tested a range of temperatures and combinations (appropriate to each construct) to achieve the strongest signal.It was hard to work on the Westminster presentation when you knew how close to the wire the wet lab was cutting it - if the chimera wasnt cloned this week then we were buggered.On the thursday, the day of the presentation, we fortunately had a breakthrough - a successful clone of mK into lux operon in SB1c3.Both student and instructor were a bit nervous - as the first team from Cardiff this would all be learning experience for all.We spent the first 3 days going through all the procedures, the bread and butter that would be essential for all labwork moving on.\"If we follow the plan we can get all this done in 10 days\" David McMaster With all our g-blocks in the freezer we could finally arrange all our pieces and see how we could move forward, hence the start of the lab management phase - as we grew more comfortable in the labwork we looked for ways to increase our efficiency.Unfortunately Laura was unable to make the conference which left a hole in the team, but nevertheless we moved on, preparing notes and printing our poster out for the big day.Our first day was stupendous, beginning with a huge conference hall presentation opening the jamboree - its loud high energy being infectious.Outside of the lab, we searched for collaboration opportunities - CRSIPR-CAS9 was a common enough system that there must be someone else using it in a similar way to us?Everyone got caught up in the excitement, with Chris and David catching up with all the teams from EE16 Paris, whilst others were scattered around the poster hall, exchanging project notes with teams from every continent in the world, as well as our closer neighbours such as Oxford and Warwick, whom we had collaborated with previously.There were quite a few colourful characters.However, with our presentation looming over the horizon (after lunch), we hunkered down and got the last minute details down.Upon further investigation, we discovered the reason for some of it - our sourced pET16b vector had an insert with the wrong restriction sites.However, this relief was mulled somewhat - our main lab space was to shut the next day, and the team split up, some to Toronto and Marseille, others to Warwick for placements.This lead to an emergency meeting whereupon it was decided that, with 1 week left in the main lab we should divert efforts into FUEL.While a few stayed behind, the team was free to mingle the 300 odd other projects around us.To a hall of judges, friends, and fellow teams we presented our diagnostic tool, highlighting our outreach efforts, our international reach, and the strong collaboration effort, even managing to answer the judges questions as a team.From then on, the week passed in a blur of conversations, the halls filled with the sound of collaboration.This led to the start of FUEL planning, an idea touched upon in our planning briefings as one of many possible side-projects.On the last day, there was a relaxed feel to it - knowing that as a teamyou have accomplished all you can is a sastisfying moment to say the least.The rest would work in the PIs lab in restriced space.3000 students from all over the world all under one roof with medals on their mind and a passion for Synthetic Biology.Concurrently Chris and Nik were busy re-doing all previous stages for the constructs, and troubleshooting along the way to work out what had failed and why.Main project wet lab team refocused on FUEL biobrick improvementThe sequences came back, and they were a surprise to say the least - only the guides were viable, and those were the ones which have been biobricked (link).From the countless hours spent in the corner of lab, to the sweeping cityscape of Boston, there is nothing about Cardiff 2016 I would have changed.We found the golden ratio, and we went into overdrive to make up for lost time, running hundreds at a time, (record = 105 in an afternoon).Our first bonafide success, even if it was just a guide RNA for a CRISPR-dCAS9 system it counts as our first biobrick-able construct.May have celebrated a little loudly when that was announced :PTo finish, I d like to note that this isnt a complete record of our project, but i hope it was insightful into how our experience was.Not 3 days after the end of exam season we began, with a crash course in synthetic biology (from a plant biologist).", "protocol": "Centrifuge for 30-60s and discard flow

at the same together but work independently, which again would improve the management of lab work.Next time we will set more time and resources to checking all our primers work appropriately, although within the time-scale of a ten-week project this can be challenging as by the time you realise there is a problem, the project has significantly progressed.We therefore decided to reduce the number of us in the lab, and split off into two groups with each one focusing on a project each.We didn t start our FUEL project until after half of our lab time was up, this really restricted the amount of time we could devote to it.When we started our lab work, the whole team was involved.IPTG inducible CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA targeted to rRNA ReverseInvestigated viable systems for future investigationUse of vector (pET16B) with non-expected insert doomed 1/3 of our potential constructsAs a result we have been unable to study the viablity of our proposed diagnostic toolWe have successfully cloned and sequenced our arabinose-inducible pBAD:mKeima and pBAD:Lux Operon:mKeima constructsWe have demonstrated that the LuxOperon portion of LUXoperon:mKeima of the fusion construct is functionalWe have been unable to show a red light output from the mKeima constructs We have therefore been unable to observe any red shifting of the light output generated by the Lux OperonThe inaugural year of Cardiff iGEM has been an excellent learning experience.A number of our primers did not work as predicted and meant that we often couldn t inspect our transformed cultures without using direct sequencing.We were unaware of the different pSB1C3 variants due to our focus on cloning biobricks into the registry-compliant chloramphenicol resistant pSB1C3.We dedicated most of our lab time to cloning our own constructs, which meant there wasn t much time, or manpower left for collaborations.There is no doubt that next year we will be in a much stronger position to succeed in all aspects of the our project.This is something we look to do from the start in 2017.We would likely use the different pSB1C3 antibiotic resistance variants instead of the three distinct plasmids we chose to use (pSB1C3, pET16B, pCOLA-DUET).", "safety": "Not only must there be trained staff on hand, the venue must be equipped to deal with whatever may arise, hence why it was easy from a H&S standpoint to use our workshop at a STEM day in our lab building, but to bring GMO material across town to a public area which doesnt have autoclavers, fume hoods, biohazard waste protocols or pretty much anything required for safe usage of lab kit made the venue nonviable.The event itself gave the Outreach team a wake-up call: they had the same training as the wet lab team, so there was identified to be a need of greater communication between both teams to ensure all appropriate steps were taken for safety.In order to work here we had to pass the University mandated GMO safety course, a one day event which covered the basics to work safely with GMOs, and how to set up a safe working space.Initially in our project we planned a workshop at a local science amusement center called  Techniquest , which used dead GMO material, which we believed would satisfy the H&S requirements.This did rattle our Outreach efforts somewhat - 2 weeks of planning down the drain but it shows how easy it can be to make assumptions - in order to even be near our materials we had a specialized lab and hours of GMO training and risk assessments, but with all of this it can easily be taken for granted.", "keywords": "concentration excitation remediation autotrophic fluorescence supercoiling fluorescent engineered respiratory Cyanobacteria", "track": "Diagnostics", "part_favorite": "",

biofilms and for helping us in our experiments, always in a good mood.We are very grateful.We also would like to thank all people who helped us in the lab (including previous iGEM members) and our family and friends for encouraging us when our experiments didn\u0092t work.", "background": "", "description": "Whereas if we do not provide the transporter and we provide the protease, the adhesion will be cleaved and the bacteria will disperse the biofilm.This allows to introduce genes for both the formation and the dispersion of biofilm under the control of an expression system that responds to a desired regulation.However, this will not be enough to ensure a non-dispersal biofilm, and definitely it will not ensure that the biofilm that is formed will be more robust and grow faster or higher than a regular biofilm, which is our main goal in order to obtain a strong and regulated biofilm for bioremediation purposes.In addition, as the system is inducible by an external signal, it will be easy to control the precise moment of the production, so the bacteria are not induced to produce when the biomass is still too low or they are not forming a biofilm.Thanks to the biobrick format, this project is modular, and different genes can be exchanged in order to consume or produce a wide variety of products, taking advantage of the biofilm properties.Finally, the demand of propionate is rising every year, therefore the biotechnological production of it would be an interesting option.However, this is only an example of what our production system could do, as it has a modular concept in which some of the parts can be exchanged.The following figure shows the genes that are necessary in order to produce propionate from the central metabolism:Figure 4.To manipulate this, we will make use of a phosphodiesterase (PDE), that will destroy the c-diGMP, and a diguanilate cyclase (DGC), that will produce it, YhjH and PleD* respectively.These four genes, lapC, lapG, yhjH, and pleD*, allow us to control the formation and dispersion of the biofilm, to enhance it and make it stronger, and to be able to induce it whenever we want to.In this way, we are going to put the biofilm genes under the control of a flip-flop system, in order to induce biofilm when we have enough biomass in the reactor, and disperse it at the end of the production cycle.Thanks to our modular system and the biobrick format, the genes for different metabolic pathways can be inserted in our biofilm-forming, glycerol-eating bacterium, in order to be able to produce any compound of interest.Propionate is the salt of propionic acid, which consists of three carbon atoms with a carboxylic group.Increase in the biodiesel production, which leads to glycerol accumulation.Because of this, we thought that it may be a good idea to feed our bacteria with glycerol.Besides, the dispersal could not be entirely satisfactory, as there exists a protein whose function is to retain LapG and prevent the proteolysis of the union of the adhesin.For these reasons, we decided to combine this control system with another one that regulated the biofilm in a metabolically level.The scpABC genes are obtained from an E. coli K12 operon, while the epimerase gene is obtained from Pseudomonas mosselii.As our final objective is to obtain an industrial strain that had all the abilities given by the different constructs, each of the constructs of this project needs to be expressed in a regulated manner, as it will be necessary to stablish a fine control.These constructions will be introduced in the genome of the bacteria by means of a miniTn7 device, a mini transposon that locates itself always in the same part of the genome, and that does not affect to the living conditions of the bacteria.The propionate genes will be under de control of an expression system inducible by salicylate.This bacterium is not able to form a biofilm, but if we provide a functional lapC gene, the accumulated adhesion LapA will be able to go out and the bacteria will be able to produce the biofilm.GlpK and GlpD are involved in the conversion of glycerol into molecules of the central metabolism.Once our bacterium can eat and use glycerol, the carbon and energy obtained from this source can be used to produce a wide range of compunds, such as plastics, propanediol, citric acid, propionate, or butanol.LapG is a periplasmic protease that participates in the biofilm dispersion process by cleaving adhesion proteins such as LapA.As we can see in the scheme, this molecule can regulate both the formation and dispersion of the biofilm, depending on the quantity of it that is present inside the cell.This flip-flop system is the same used five years ago by the team of our University, in which we have a first part that is induced by IPTG and a second one that is induced by an increase in the temperature.However, this adhesin is a really huge protein that has got several kilobases in the genome, and the genetic manipulation of it would be very difficult to achieve.Once we have that, we can improve the glycerol bioremediation!Glycerol is an alcohol of three carbon atoms, which is part of biomolecules such as phospholipids or triglycerides, and is also an important intermediate compound for the cell metabolism.There are two complementary systems; one depends on the di-c-GMP (DGC, diguanylate cyclase, and PDE, phosphodiesterase), and the other one controls the amount of adhesion proteins (LapC, which controls the LapA secretion, and LapG, which controls the LapA stability).LapA is the adhesin responsible of the adhesion of the bacteria to the surface during the biofilm formation process.This module includes the use of both structural and regulatory genes that participate in the biofilm formation cycles.This system will be implemented in Pseudomonas putida.The first idea that comes to our minds is that we can focus on the adhesin in order to detach the biofilm from the surface whenever we want it to be disperses, or give it to the bacteria from an inducible promoter to control the adhesion.It is widely used as a human and animal food preservative, as an intermediate in the production of plastics, pesticides and textiles, and also in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.It is present in the cells as propionyl-CoA, which is a product of the fatty acids beta-oxidation, and enters the central metabolism by being converted to succinate.This increase in the glycerol generation has led to a fall in prices and its accumulation (Figure 2).A lot of different products can be easily produced and secreted by the microorganisms, as propionate, plastics, butanol, citric acid...Our project is based on biofilms, communities of bacteria that protect themselves from external factors by an exopolysaccharides coat.This system is part of a cascade, that will highly increase the production of the different genes of the operon, allowing a huge production of the product we desire to obtain.In addition, it is also easy to perform deletion mutants in this species, fundamental to one of the branches of the manipulation of the biofilm.In the Figure 1 you can see the regulation system that controls the induction and dispersion of biofilms in Pseudomonas putida:Figure 1.We decided to modify Pseudomonas putida so it will form and disperse the biofilm at our will, and afterwards we have modified them in order to increase and optimise the consumption of glycerol, as well as introduce some genes in it so it can produce propionate.If we could find the way to increase its consumption of glycerol, we will be ending with a huge problem of environmental pollution, as well as feed our production system.For this end, we have produced a P. putida strain that has a knock-in with gene glpF.Pseudomonas putida is a GRAS (Genetically Regarded As Safe) organism, what means that it is completely safe, even for its release to the environment.Regulation of the biofilm formation and dispersion.LapC is an essential protein for the secretion of adhesion proteins (such as LapA) that are involved in the biofilm formation process.This bacterium already has all the genes needed for the assimilation of glycerol, but they are repressed in the absence of this molecule.This gene is an aquaporine that specifically helps to the entrance of glycerol inside the cell, as we can see in the Figure 3.Figure 3.ScpABC and Epimerase are the proteins which we will be using for our artificial pathway.We have designed an artificial way, which can be seen in the next figure.It is therefore urgent to find another way to use this product, so the excess of glycerol is removed from the environment and used in other industries.Some of the current options are its use in animal feeding or as a solvent for chemical and enzymatic reactions.By cloning glpF under the control of another promoter, this problem can be easily solved.This decision was made in order to have appropriate growing conditions.The glycerol genes will be under a constitutive promoter, as the objective is to remove the maximum amount of glycerol we are able to.Besides, its genome has been completely sequence, and there exist many useful tools to manipulate its genetics, as it is the case of the miniTn7 device.Propionate itself is only common in some bacterial groups such as Propionibacterium, which get energy from the propionic fermentation process.For this purpose, we used a molecular ON/OFF switch which is regulated by a simple compound, salicylate.A biofilm is a community of bacteria that have attached to a surface and between them, and that have produced an extracellular matrix made out of polysaccharides.This type of fermentation uses an anaerobic pathway using the inverse reactions of the Krebs cycle, and produces propionate from the central metabolism.Currently, propionate is produced by chemical synthesis.These four genes will be the responsible for the construction of the pathway.Figure 6.Metabolic pathway of the glycerol uptake and incorporation in the central metabolism.", "design": "When GlpF was produced from a salicylate inducible expression system, this strain reached higher growth rates than the wild type when using glycerol as the sole carbon source.On the other hand, we know that P. putida is able to form biofilms.Crude glycerol obtained from the biodiesel industry is constantly added to a continuous bioreactor, where it is converted to an useful molecule by action of biofilms.This way, we convert a waste to a useful molecule in a profitable manner.Other conversions systems have been developed in order to use the crude glycerol from the biodiesel industry.In order to take advantage of this ability of the biofilms to degrade glycerol in higher rates, we have also genetically modified this bacterium to control the formation and dispersal of the biofilm.The ultimate goal of this project is to have a bioreactor in which bacteria form biofilms on the surfaces of the tank when activated, consume glycerol (the input) and disperse at will when the bioreactor needs to be cleaned.For that reason, many researchers have focused on looking for new ways to use that crude glycerol and avoid its accumulation in the environment (for more information, see Integrated Human Practices).To help solving that problem, the UPO Sevilla Team has developed a modified bacterium that is able to assimilate glycerol in a most efficient way.Glycerol is a by-product of the biodiesel industry.However, we have increased the glycerol consumption by two complementary ways: by increasing the entrance of the molecule in the bacteria and by using biofilms.To solve that problem, we have integrated a gene coding for an inner membrane glycerol transporter in the genome of P. putida.That way, I hope to eliminate glycerol from the environment in higher rates compared to other conversion systems.For that reason, we have genetically modified this bacterium in order to increase the assimilation of glycerol.Metabolic pathway modeling performed by our team predicts that the limiting step for glycerol assimilation is its transport across the cell membrane.Using glycerol as a carbon source, bacteria can produce another molecule with added value.The need to search for alternative renewable energy sources and the increase in the biodiesel production has led to the release of large quantities of glycerol.We make use of Pseudomonas putida, a bacterium that is able to degrade glycerol.", "human_practice": "In this event, we did not only get to know the projects, but we also were able to appreciate the great work that the groups were doing.The initiative came from iGEM group of Valencia, who contacted us and the iGEM team from Barcelona.We felt really delighted and integrated when interacting with the different disciplines that make up a team, from biotechnologists and biomedical scientists or computer engineers, to a journalist.Thanks to this meeting of different teams, we all made good friends and we are now a great family where everyone helps each other.Our university conducted a workshop on legumes entitled \"Legumes, much more than a food\" located in Plaza Nueva, next to the City Hall in Seville.We took advantage of the occasion by distributing brochures with information about iGEM, about synthetic biology and about our project in an attempt to bring it closer to people who have no idea about this field.For us, the influence of people and their interest in new scientific projects is a huge breakthrough.During the event presentations from experts they were divided into the following sessions:It was a unique experience that allowed us to discuss our project and the way we conducted experiments with people experienced in the field.The European Researchers  Night is a European science project promoted by the European Commission within the Marie Curie Sktodowska the Horizon 2020 program, which takes place simultaneously in over 250 European cities since 2005.For the fifth consecutive year, it was held in order to enhance the human side of research through direct contact and conversation with experts.As we didn\u0092t know the city, our friends from Valencia were our guides and told us a lot of interesting historical information and some ancient legends of Valencia (such as the bat logo of the city).Another surprise was a picnic that the team from Valencia had prepared for all of us.Each part of the project was explained by a different member.It was very interesting to know the use of biomechanics and biomedicine to create transgenic plants using a novel and much more efficient technique .Our group was the second one to present the project.We talked about our project, and also explained the techniques we make use of to fulfil our goals.The scientific sessions took place in the hotel Silken Al-Andalus Palace.This event organized by the group of Molecular Microbiology of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM), has a totally educational and academic purpose.Apart from students, we were glad to explain our project to tourists, teachers and professors from different fields, parents, children and curious walkers.Although we belong to the Universidad Pablo de Olavide, this time we could have our own space due to the magnitude and recognition of our project.We were chatting for a few weeks until we agreed on a date for the meeting, which was not hard.The other groups gave them some ideas to help them improve their techniques.Once the presentations had finished, all group members met together and talked about what we thought about the other projects and how we could help each other.Sadly, we had to say goodbye at the train station.The 3 groups (UPO-Sevilla, UPF-CRG Barcelona and Valencia UPV) discussed constructively on different projects and applications and contributions to science.We had some very constructive talks for our projects and ourselves.After the presentations, all members of the group went out to have dinner together.They made a really fun show and we had a great time listening to their progress and difficulties on the creation of a probiotic to act as a preventive treatment for cancer.Specifically, the activity brought together more than 1,200 researchers to show their work to the public in the 2016 edition.We set up our stand next to the cathedral in the center of Seville, which is a really beautiful place.They were a little embarrassed to present their project because they thought it was not as good as the others.Until that time it was unknown to them, but now they are interested on our performance in the competition.As part of our meeting the IV Research Award BIOMEDAL a relevant research work in the field of Molecular Microbiology, as well as prizes for the best communications delivered.Several experts from the molecular microbiology sector participate in these meetings, making presentations on their work to help young researchers.This time the XI meeting was this time with Francis J.M.In these meetings, we combine the high scientific level of the Spanish Microbiology Society with an atmosphere of harmony and cordiality.Mojica (University of Alicante), who gave the inaugural lecture entitled \"The growth curve CRISPR\".Molecular Microbiology group is one of eleven specialized groups of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM), founded in 1946.It was a very nice surprise and the food was really tasty.In addition, we informed PhD students and other researchers about the iGEM competition.The purpose of the meeting was to know better the rest of the projects and the members from the other teams.On 30th th September, it was held on 7 Andalusian capitals and Jerez (Cadiz).The last year\u0092s edition had the participation of 250 cities in 32 European countries with the aim of bringing science and researchers to the general public, proving that science and research can be fun and that it also related to everyday life, and promoting science communication among young people.The commitment of researchers is key for the success of the activity, which records an increasing number of scientists and scientists participating in the event each year.Last August (18, 19 and 20), the three Spanish iGEM groups met in the city of Valencia.The Eleventh Meeting of the Molecular Microbiology Group of the SEM (Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Microbiologia) in Sevilla, took place during the days 6th, 7th and 8th of September 2016.We finished the exhibition with a Spot of Human Practices.Finally, it was the turn of UPF-CRG Barcelona.The tradition was started in 1996 and continued with great success at subsequent meetings of the Group.", "modeling": "Right: Visualization of program s output instants after the first cell division.How bacterial consumption of the limiting substrate affects cell and biofilm growthThe velocity in wich, at a given point in time, each cell grows in length is proposed to be:Where v is the length growth rate of the bacteria in question, k is a proportionality constant, p represents the limiting substrate consumption rate by the cell, and L depicts its length.Therefore, the length growth rate of a bacterium is inversely proportional to its length.Note: This is not a real visualization of the program s output but a diagram.As a result of equations 1 and 2 and Fick s diffusion, each bacterium in the biofilm grows at its own time-dependent velocity, to reach the critical length and divide.The bacteria in the program are attracted to each other and to the solid wall, to reflect the action of adhesins (i.e LapA), which are transmembranal proteins that enable adherance to form a biofilm.However, it exists simultaneously a certain repulsion force, to emulate in this way the superficial tension of the cells and wall (Figure 4).At the same time, the position of each cell is also affected by thermal agitation-associated diffusion.Limiting substrate consumption rate equation.Where pmax corresponds to the maximum length growth rate per bacterial length unit, S is the limiting substrate concentration in the area surrounding the bacterium, and M depicts the limiting substrate concentration at which half of the maximum length growth rate is achieved.To model that bigger cells would uptake more limiting substrate than smaller cells, equation 2 shows that p is linearly dependent on the length of the bacterium (L).In this way, they are considered cylindrical tubes of length ranging from \u0093L0\u0094 to \u00932L0 + ?\u0094, with semi-spheres of radius \u0093?/2\u0094 at both ends (Figure 2 left).The software predicts the growth in size of the initial bacteria over time, until the cells reach the critical length (\u00932L0 + 2?\u0094).One of the simulations consists in a microscopic prediction of biofilm growth.As v depends on p and p is dependent on L, it is necessary in turn for v to be inversely proportional to L (equation 1).Initially, the limiting substrate is evenly distributed in the three dimensional space.However, bacterial consumption creates gradients of the limiting substrate.Schematic diagram representing how the bacteria consume the limiting substrate in the sub-area they are located.The intensity of the color is proportional to the limiting substrate concentration.The reason is that, for the purpose of enhancing biological activity in a bioreactor, biofilm induction is a pillar in the project.Specifically, two kinds of simulations regarding biofilm formation have been performed.However, the simulation models that bacterial length growth (v) is indepedent from the actual length of the bacterium.At the same time, the software includes standard Fick s diffusion equations to incorporate how these mass gradients spontaneously tend to disappear.Equations determining bacterial position, where rj and r? j indicate the projections of the positions of particle j along \u0088 uj and along the directions perpendicular to \u0088 uj, respectively; Fj and F? j are the parallel and perpendicular components of the forces, respectively; and R, R? 1 ,R? 2, R? 1 , and R? 2 are independent Gaussian random numbers of variance 1 and zero mean.Visualization of the software s final output.This causes that sub-area to reduce its limiting substrate concentration, and limiting substrate diffusion from neighbouring sub-areas occur.Starting with one bacteria, a biofilm has been generated.The prediction starts modelling a 3D liquid space in which one or more bacteria are attached to a solid wall.That is, how regions (referred to as \"sub-areas\" in figure 3) where less limiting substrate is present incorporate limiting substrate from adjacent regions by difussion.This causes cells to grow at lower velocities in regions where less limiting substrate is present.", "notebook": "Now, we name the construction of pleD* as

also fulfill the two most important requirements in iGEM regarding biosafety: we only work with organisms from Risk Groups 1 or 2, and we completely avoid the release of genetically modified organisms and their products to the wild, by using containment protocols and sterilization of work material.These biofilm-forming bacteria will also be able to consume glycerol by expressing a glycerol transporter (glpF) with the same system, and they are also useful in order to produce many different compounds using that carbon source, such as propionate.Therefore, the main application of our bacteria is the industrial bioremediation and production of compounds.Our chassis bacterium, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, belongs to the Risk group 1 and is harmless and non-pathogenic for humans.The main risk about the use of a biofilm overproducing bacterium would be the transmission of biofilm production genes to other species, which could lead to the generation of highly resistant bacteria.The microorganisms we are using are not dangerous for human being, but there is a risk considering the presence of immunocompromised people.Therefore, the main actions we are taking are the containment of the biological material, the sterilization of the laboratory material, waste and work surfaces, and also to avoid the formation of aerosol particles that could lead to the spread of the bacteria.Our team registered two organisms in the check in, our main chassis organism (Pseudomonas putida KT2442) and Pseudomonas mosselii, from which we have obtained a part (epimerase) using gene synthesis technology.Responsible person for the safety of biology labs at our institution: Isabel Alonso Perez (+34 954977565, CABD).To avoid this, we do not use plasmid constructs, but our genes are stably inserted in the bacterial genome to avoid horizontal gene transfer, using the miniTn7 tool.The miniTn7 tool allows us to avoid many biosafety issues related to plasmid use, such as horizontal gene transfer or antibiotic selection (which can lead to resistance spreading); and it also makes our work much easier and simpler (avoids many problems related to plasmid stability, plasmid copy number and also provides the suitability to multiple bacterial hosts)If our project is completely finished and turns into a real product, the whole process can be developed in a biotechnological factory.Within the industrial applications, our modified strain is useful for the generation of products from bioremediation processes.You must read the safety specifications of the products you are going to use, including labels and safety cards.Keep the containers for chemical products closed and well organized.Avoid the inhalation of chemicals.This center belongs to the Spanish Public Administration and therefore fulfills all the national safety requirements.After we started our work, our team instructors and lab technicians provided us safety training.The use of lab coats and gloves is also mandatory in our lab.The UPO-Sevilla wet lab team uses the facilities of the Centro Andaluz de Biolog\u00eda del Desarrollo (CABD).This avoids biosafety issues such as the uncontrolled activity of exogenous genes and the harmful effect of an accidental release to the environment.Since we are working with genetically modified organisms, one risk is the release of these to the environment.Some of our safety guidelines are:Eating, drinking and smoking in the laboratories is forbidden.Use of security glasses, the use of contact lenses is not recommended.You must know the location and use of safety showers and fire extinguishers.", "keywords": "bacteriocins cementation TeamProtoCat antibiotics Acinetobacter propionate Description fluorescence recombinase

uterus.Endometriosis is a disease of the female reproductive system that is generally characterized as the growth of tissue very similar to that of the inner lining of the uterus, the endometrium, growing elsewhere in the body, most often in the abdomen and pelvic regions though it has been recorded in the lungs and brain.It s unknown exactly what causes endometriosis, though there are a number of theories, including retrograde menstruation, where tissue that is normally expelled during menses instead flows backwards and then cells embed in the surrounding tissue, or fetal development, which is supported by the fact that a number of infant autopsies have shown the signs of endometriosis.Unfortunately, there is a stigma around menstrual disorders that is hard to get past.This leads to the average 7- to 10- year wait between the onset of symptoms and a final diagnosis of endometriosis.In summary, endometriosis is an incredibly painful, chronic disease that too often goes untreated.For another look at endometriosis, below is a video from the Endometriosis Foundation of AmericaEndometriosis affects 1 in 10 women, including well-known figures like Daisy Ridley of Star Wars: Episode VIII and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Endometriosis can affect a girl immediately after puberty, but this myth may have spread because of the immense delay between the onset of symptoms and an accurate diagnosis.Until recently, total hysterectomy (removal of uterus and ovaries) was used as a treatment for endometriosis, but it has not been proven effective and is going out of practice, as pain from endometriosis would often continue even after this extreme surgery.Once endometriosis is diagnosed, the most effective treatment is deep tissue excision to remove the growths of ectopic endometrium.However, the current diagnostic method is also lacking in accuracy because it assumes that endometriotic lesions will always be visible when in fact endometriosis can exist microscopically and still cause pain.Scientists like Asgi Fazleabas have studied differences in miRNA profiles between the eutopic endometrium in a healthy state compared to a disease state and found a number of miRNA that have different activity levels between the two states.The only totally accurate diagnostic method for endometriosis is a combination of laparoscopic surgery, to get sight of ectopic lesions of endometrial tissue, followed by obtaining a sample of that tissue and then sending it for pathologic confirmation in a lab.Synthetic genetic circuits using Boolean (binary) logic can then implement these promoters to identify estrogen sensitivity and progesterone resistance in a cell culture.Another factor that can identify cells affected by endometriosis is a difference in microRNA (miRNA) levels.miRNA is a form of single stranded RNA that is present in all mammalian cells, but the nucleotide codes and the activities of these strands differ between cell types and cell states.The pain may be related to the heightened inflammation around the lesions, as well as the scar tissue that the body creates to cover them.At this point, a woman might be prescribed low-level hormonal therapy in the form of a contraceptive pill, or be told to simply take pain relieving medications like ibuprofen.With this in mind, we designed a pair of genetic promoter regions that can increase the expression of a gene based on the presence of progesterone or estradiol.Although endometriosis can affect any uterus-owning person after puberty, it s often thought to be more prevalent in older women; this is a myth.Endometriosis can appear when a person reaches puberty, as it is a very hormone-dependent disease.We provided all new characterization of the protein and its activity in mammalian cells.We created new, synthetic promoters to respond to this disease markerWe characterized microRNA profiles in model cells under varying conditionsWe characterized a serine integrase, TP901, that could give a genetic circuit memory across a cycle- - - C. Nezhat et al 2012.While ectopic endometrial lesions are similar in appearance to the endometrium, having the same glands, the ectopic tissue behaves differently in response to hormones, as it cannot be shed at the end of the menstrual cycle.There may also be a genetic component to endometriosis, as studies have found that girls with a close relative affected by endometriosis are 5-7X more likely to have it themselves.In the latter case, the misplaced tissue s disease characteristics would be activated by puberty, while the former may happen by chance at any point after puberty.We at MIT iGEM believe that if endometriosis could be diagnosed sooner, it would not give the disease as much time to progress, making treatment more effective with fewer surgeries, and it would alleviate years of chronic pain and distress from not knowing the cause.The tissue is, however, very sensitive to the presence of estradiol, the most active form of the hormone estrogen.Affected women wait, on average, between 7 and 10 years for an accurate diagnosis for their chronic pain.The diagnosis process begins with suspicion based on a description of symptoms like extended, painful menses and gastrointestinal discomfort.Because of this, we needed a tool that would allow us to consider both phases in the cycle.from the abdomen and down the legs), pain during sexual activities, lost pregnancies, and infertility.", "description": "The increase in cross-section area along the channel reduces the flow rate of the fluid, making it easier for the cells to stick to the surface of the chamberUsing a syringe pump to continuously replenish media inside the chamber after cell adhesion, preventing the media from drying out inside the chamber - which happened in model 1Including a 3D-printed frame, fitting the size of a 96-well plate, so that the whole seeding and culturing process can be monitored and captured using a microscope.Harvest the cells using the standard culturing protocol, and then resuspend in media to achieve 120E4 cells/ml seeding density.Clean and wash the chamber with 70% ethanol and 1x PBS.Use a 5mL syringe to load 1ml of media, 0.5ml of cell solution, and another media column to a 1.59mm diameter tube.Use a syringe pump to load media and cell solution in the tube to the device.Figure.Since we couldn t check for cells inside the device right after seeding, We couldn t narrow down the main reasons for unsuccessful cell culturing in the microfluidic device.Material: PDMS.Since we couldn t detect any cells under 10X light microscope (24 hrs post seeding) in the first model, we proposed several modifications to the device after doing some literature research, including:Creating a diamond-shape chamber specifically for cell adhesion.This model, however, had rectangular cell traps along the channel.Harvest the cells were using the standard culturing protocol, and then resuspend in media to achieve 2E4cells/cm^2 seeding density.Sequentially sterilize and wash the channel with 1ml of 70% ethanol and 1xPBS by directly pipetting into the inlet.Through the same inlet, pipet 1ml of cells solution (1E6 cells/ml).Incubate the whole device with seeded cells at 37 degrees Celcius.Figure.Thus, the MIT iGEM team decided to collaborate with the Boston University Hardware iGEM team to develop a protocol for mammalian cell culture in microfluidic devices .Automatically simulates estrogen and progesterone cycle in vitro cell cultureResembles dynamically changing estrogen and progesterone concentrationsDynamically monitors cell response and output gene expression We collaborated with the Boston University Hardware iGEM Team to culture mammalian cells in their microfluidic devices.The images didn t show any cells inside the channel even though cells in the control culture dish grew normally (image not shown), which was seeded at the same time with as microfluidic device.We started with the simplest experiment, which is growing HEK293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells in a microfluidic device.C) A syringe pump is set up to continuously pump the solution containing cells into the channel during seeding (seeding flow rate was: 20 ul/min, cell density: 120E4 cells/ml).Figure.At the 26th frame (250 minutes after seeding), the cells were out of focus, which could indicate adhesion of the cells to the chamber s surface.Unfortunately, at the end of the video (after 350 minutes), the media within the chamber dried out, which has been a major problem for our experimental setup.Read more about our collaboration on the BU Hardware Team s websiteAs our way of giving back to iGEM, we created a screening tool for use in Gateway cloning reactions.Therefore, cell culture performed in microfluidic devices could resemble in vivo conditions due to tight control of the microenvironment [2].Microfluidic device model 2.a = 3250um; b = 400um; volume of the chamber = ~ 4.4ul.B) Input and output wires are connected to inlet and outlet of the microfluidic device.Thus, we decided to repeat the experiment (using model 2) with dynamic monitoring right from the seeding stage.The device had 2 sets of channels, one for fluid flow (labeled blue in the diagram), and another one for air exchange (labeled red in the diagram).With this, we hope that iGEM will be able to distribute the parts that were discontinued, and mammalian work that relies on Gateway reactions will be significantly easier for future teams.While we used the pDEST mCherry successfully in our lab, we needed to test the clarity of the protocol we had written, and whether they would work in other labs.Blue arrows: show evidence of poliferation Right after seeding, the cells were still in suspension; therefore, they all had spherical shape.The blue arrows point at cells showing evidience of mitosis, including appearance of two nuclei within a single cell and formation of the metaphase plate.In the past Gateway reactions have used the ccdB death gene as a negative selection tool to pick bacterial cultures that have successfully taken up a copy of the desired plasmid.At the begining of the summer, we had a discussion with the BU Wetlab Team to learn more about recombinases because some of their members and especially their graduate mentor - Ben Weinberg - had substantial experience working with recombinases.On the other hand, automation is another advantage of microfluidic technology.A 3D-printed frame is used to put the device on the microscope s placeholder, allowing dynamic monitoring.The ability to precisely control fluid flows and chemical species as well as the automation of microfluidic technology are highly beneficial to future development of our project.We were thrilled to work with the Tufts University iGEM team in order to test our protocol, and our construct.The timing of the fluid flow can be regulated with high accuracy because of the short response time of in-chip membrane valves (as quick as 1 ms)[1].After 24 hours, the channel was completely dried out.Images of microfluidic channel, 24 hours after cells seeding.Viability analysis and apoptosis induction of breast cancer cells in a microfluidic device: effect of cytostatic drugs.Additionally, the BU Wetlab Team also helped us to obtain sequences for the recombinases and their equivalent recognition sites from Dr. Wilson Wong s lab.However, the majority of their work with recombinase has been with tyrosine (Cre or FLP) family and done on E. coli.", "design": "We ve also considered an ideal clinical situation, which we see as a possibility after more thoroughtesting of our work, and finally a broader view on the applications of mammalian synbio in medicine.Read more about applications of mammalian synbio in medicine", "human_practice": "She helped us reframe our project from a gene therapy to a diagnostic that could provide much better help to patients.Prof. Kevin Osteen, helped us understand some of the challenges associated with using microfluidics in a diagnostic and got us thinking about incorporating such a system into our diagnostic.The BU Hardware iGEM Team, helped us understand some of the challenges associated with designing microfluidics and provided us with valuable insights into how we could streamline the process in order to make our diagnostic robust and reliable.Prof. Asgi Fazleabas, one of the leading experts in endometriosis helped us reframe the specific biomarkers our diagnostic sough to detect.He helped us understand that progesterone resistance is one of the most robust phenotypes associated with endometriosis across most patients -

encoding miRNAs, and our transfection system was neither infectious nor self-replicating, which lowered the safety risks for working with these materials even lower.In order to greatly improve the safety of our project, we decided to design a diagnostic that works in vitro rather than in vivo, which removes any concern of the project causing any health-related side effects to a patient.To minimize risk of infection, maintain sterility, and contain the spread of a pathogen in the case that one arises, we worked with all mammalian cells in biosafety cabinets in a separate room in the lab and wore different lab coats from the ones we used when working with bacteria.In our experiments for testing our miRNA sensors, we cotransfected siRNAs into mammalian cells with the sensors.When working with BL2 materials, including the human cell lines HEK293, MCF-7, and tHESC, which we used for our experiments, there is risk of contracting blood-borne pathogens from these cells.To ensure the safety of ourselves and the biological materials we worked with, we used appropriate personal protective equipment, including gloves, lab coats, and eyewear when necessary.When working with BL1 materials, such as the E. coli we used for molecular cloning, there is risk of infecting ourselves and contaminating the equipment we use, potentially leading to infection of others.Additionally, since our project is a diagnostic, we decided to make the output for a positive diagnosis the production of a yellow fluorescent protein, which is nontoxic to human cells.The recombinase itself is potentially hazardous, since it performs unidirectional inversion of DNA, but since the plasmid encoding it will be introduced to cells in a biopsy sample rather than a living human, there is no risk of harming any patients with our diagnostic.Some of the laboratory equipment we used, especially glassware, could potentially become hazardous if it breaks, and several of the reagents we used are

use all the while (potentially) turning a profit.Returning to the example above, linearly extrapolating on findings from a small proof-of-concept study on MDCs, by passing that same volume of water (approximately 1/8th the size of Sydney Harbor) through an MDC one could potentially produce energy on the gigawatt scale, all the while removing 90% of salt content in a single run-through.One of the UN\u0092s top sustainable developmental goals is universal access to clean water and sanitation.But with a rising world population and freshwater accounting for only 3% of the world\u0092s supply, there are many challenges still left to overcome in order to meet that goal.As briefly mentioned on our page for MDCs, clean water supply is one of the UN\u0092s top sustainable development goals.Though MDCs (like MFCs) typically rely on anodophilic and exoelectrogenic bacteria, by expressing shewanella-derived nanowires in our E. coli chassis, we are able to both greatly improve E. coli\u0092s aptitude for desalination and open the door for further study with the model organism.Since the 1970s however, the use of electrochemically active proteins, like seen in the Shewanella and Geobacter genera has removed the need for mediators and led to improved efficiency and net positive energy production.Additionally, whereas other energy sources (sustainable or not) tend to require some degree of complex oversight (consider the litany of redundant protocols involved in nuclear power production) MFCs are largely passive, with even the most \u0093high-maintenance\u0094 models requiring little more than a continuous inflow of fuel (think wastewater piping).We will also use Bielefeld\u0092s results as one of the benchmarks by which we will measure the success of our engineered E. coli.In 2013, Bielefeld\u0092s iGEM team conducted a project on MFCs, also looking at their efficiency and the lack of engineering on the biological side to the technology.Unlike these current methods, the \u0091hands-off\u0092 operation of MDCs with their free energy requirements make them accessible to both developed and developing countries alike.While MFCs used to have a reputation for inefficiency, this came largely in part from the misconception that chemical mediators were absolutely necessary to transfer electrons from bacteria to the anodes of fuel cells.Additionally, they designed (but did not test) one of the cytochrome complexes required for nanowire development.Barring the discovery of large underground aquifers or other improbable events, the most likely way to meet this goal is through water desalination.While there has been significant engineering involved in the electrode design and physical construction of MFCs, preciously little has been done on the biological side.Considering the prevalence of coal and gas fired power plants, it is not hard to see how many of these problems go hand-in-hand.Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) combine the technologies used in microbial fuel cell (MFCs) with those from electrodialysis systems to create low-cost, low-maintenance, and environmentally-friendly alternatives to current industrial desalination procedures.That is to say that even with the introduction of unconventional fuels such as wastewater, discarded foodstuffs, or compost, MFCs are capable of producing energy.The challenges posed by water desalination are in no way new and until recent years have been met with many methods equally \u0091historic\u0092 in nature.", "design": "Also, due to the ease of engineering E. coli, in the future, we can add to our system in order to handle several other aspects often involved in tertiary treatment, such as nitrogen removal, chlorine removal, [16] and antibiotic and pharmaceutical removal [17].Also, the physical design of the system could allow for reduced contact between our E. coli and water in order to achieve this partial removal of phosphorus.Our system would be designed in a way for easy removal of the E. coli from the wastewater in order to harvest the phosphorus for future work.[10] Therefore,our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli could be used to remove phosphorus from the water before the water leaves the outlet pipe.[5]Therefore, our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli could be applied to remove some phosphorus from the effluent after the effluent leaves the digester.This would increase the amount of nitrogen, the limiting nutrient in the effluent, that plants can use, and therefore, less effluent (and less excess phosphorus) would need to be applied.Adding to this design, we could create a compartment housing the bioreactor with modified E. coli for uptaking phosphorus at the contaminated source of water.Our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli would be useful during tertiary treatment of the wastewater treatment process.While the amount of phosphorus that enters the tile drain system varies with soil type and season, the researchers concluded that, based on similar studies, the observed relationship between phosphorus in tile drainage systems and watersheds are likely relevant for many other watersheds in the midwestern United States.[15] Our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli system provides another option for biological phosphorus removal in tertiary treatment.[5] \u0093Managing Phosphorus for Agriculture and the Environment,\u0094 PennState Extension.Excess phosphorus then accumulates on the soil, and surface runoff can carry phosphorus to bodies of water.[13] The Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies are requiring reductions in the amount of phosphorus in wastewater discharge [14].[18] T. Yamashita and R. Yamamoto-Ikemoto, \u0093Nitrogen and phosphorus removal from wastewater treatment plant effluent via bacterial sulfate reduction in an anoxic bioreactor packed with wood and iron,\u0094 International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, vol.This way, the effluent contains both necessary nutrients, but there would be less excess phosphorus.Results indicated that tile drainage accounted for 48% of the monthly dissolved phosphorus and 40% of the monthly total phosphorus exported from the watershed.The chemical removal of phosphorus involves the formation of a precipitate by the addition of metal salts.While a small amount of phosphorus settles to the bottom of the digester, the rest of the phosphorus is in the effluent.Some of the ammonium is released as ammonia gas, and the rest of the ammonia will be incorporated into the soil, where microorganisms convert it to nitrite and then nitrate, the form in which most plants uptake nitrogen.[14] Environmental Protection Agency, \"Advanced Wastewater Treatment to Achieve Low Concentration of Phosphorus\", Office of Water and Watersheds, Seattle, WA, 2007.[8]While tile drainage systems are beneficial due to their ability to increase crop yields and reduce surface runoff, they also are problematic due to their export of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides, such as atrazine, into waterways.[6]) Therefore, ammonia in the effluent will not be released as gas, and microorganisms in the soil can convert the nitrite to nitrate.[9] An eight-year study on six different tile drains and a watershed outlet within the Upper Big Walnut Creek watershed in central Ohio concluded that tile drainage systems\u0092 contribution to phosphorus in surface water is not negligible, as previously thought.Tertiary treatment refers to any additional treatment after secondary treatment, and this often involves removal of impurities and nutrients, such as phosphorus.[2] S. M. Mitchell, N. Kennedy, J. Ma, G. Yorgey, C. Kruger, J. L. Ullman, and C. Frear, \u0093Anaerobic Digestion Effluents And Processes: The Basics,\u0094 Washington State University Extension, FS171E, pp.Another major nutrient for crop, nitrogen, is also present in the effluent, although some of the organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium.[10] K. King, M. Williams and N. Fausey, \"Contributions of Systematic Tile Drainage to Watershed-Scale Phosphorus Transport\", Journal of Environmental Quality, vol.[15] Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, \"Phosphorus Treatment and Removal Technology\", Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, St. Paul, MN, 2006.An effluent containing most of the nutrients in manure passes through the digester and is collected for use in fields.About 25% of farmland in the United States and Canada uses tile drainage because over-saturated soils provide insufficient aeration and thus inhibit crop growth.The annual flow-weighted mean for dissolved reactive phosphorus in tile drainage systems was 0.12 mg/L, and the annual flow-weighted mean for total phosphorus in tile drainage systems was 0.15 mg/L.Our system would be designed to attach to the end of the outlet pipe.This is a problem because when cow manure is used as fertilizer, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient.Also, we would add genes (based on Nanjing-China\u0092s 2013 iGEM project) to our E. coli to absorb and degrade atrazine.[2] The methane gas is then collected for use as bioenergy.By placing trzN downstream of the ribosome switch, we would only produce trzN when necessary.The precipitate, and therefore the phosphorus, can then be removed.[4]Still, most of the nutrient content from the manure stays in the effluent.[11] Also, in the future, we could work on developing a genetic system for nitrogen remediation to incorporate into our E. coli.The phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) then store 5 to 30% of their dry weight as phosphorus.Our system can also be adapted for nitrification, converting ammonia to water soluble nitrite, by adding the genes for ammonia monooxygenase (BBa_K1067003), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase(BBa_K1067004), and cytochromes A and X (BBa_K1067002).", "human_practice": "Coming away from this meeting we began to focus more on design criteria such as how much phosphorus we needed to retrieve, began looking at products that already existed, and broadened our scope of potential application.They gave us feedback and information we would need to provide them in order to pitch our product on an industrial scale.From the outset of our project, we understood that we would receive pushback regarding the use of E. coli in water.Based on advice we received, we made posters to explain our project and set up a booth at the Wabash River Festival in West Lafayette to discuss the phosphorus problem, our solution, and what it means with people at the festival.He also encouraged us look into the phosphorus cycle and see where our Implementation could have the largest impact.Additionally, Andi provided us with information on 2 stage ditches as both an alternative method of phosphorus reclamation and as a potential area for application of our method in conjunction with the ditches.From this discussion, we widened our focus to the entire phosphorus cycle, started looking at mass balance systems for phosphorus, and set up meetings with people involved in various stages of water cleanup like the USDA lab on campus, the Lily Nature Center, and the West Lafayette Waste Water Treatment Facility.He also talked to us about his work with phosphorus, which gave us insight into our design.He encouraged us to focus on the larger context of our potential solution; focus on the mass balance of the system, energy usage, environmental impacts, and the entirety of the water cycle.As we did more research, we found that these beads were ideal for our project as the E. coli would be unlikely to escape and would be viable for up to 4 weeks.Below you can find specific design or direction changes we made based on our meetings.After discussions with scientists and businessman at DAS, we decided to talk to policy experts in the government.As Purdue President Mitch Daniels said, \u0093It\u0092s only innovation when it is useful to someone.\u0094At this meeting with the USDA we narrowed down design criteria for a prototype phosphorus reclaim module.This prompted us to return to the USDA to talk about the specifics of phosphorus application and the sustainability of current farming practices.This started a dialogue with the public and gave us valuable insight on further communication and presentations.Our next stop in our discovery was the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Lab.We resolved to design our system in such a way that the phosphorus was tightly held but also easily removable.We then held a design meeting in whoch we iterated to find a design that the USDA would develop for us.Andi Hodaj discussed tile drains in depth and gave us good information on how we could implement a phosphorus reclamation module within one.This information again broadened our thoughts on potential application and gave us enough information of tile drains to begin brainstorming a potential prototype.We met with the Chief Science Liason of Bindley Biosicence Center, Dr. Thomas Sors, who was very helpful throughout our project.Additionally, they discussed tile drains as a potential area for application of our system and encouraged us to attend Andi Hodaj\u0092s thesis defense.We attended a seminar on phosphorus given by Dr. Kevin King in which he talked about the \u0093stickiness\u0094 of phosphates.We set up a conference call in which we discussed our early ideas for a phosphorus accumulating E. coli that could be used on agricultural fields.Most importantly, he talked to us about system modularity, which led to us designing our system so that many different projects could utilize it.We were lucky in our discovery process to stumble upon the 2016 Midwest Clean Energy Forum that was held on campus.We talked to one of our advisors who recommended we speak to Dr. Jay Garland at the EPA.This helped us meet some of the design criteria that we arrived at with other experts.Our first visit was to Dow AgroSciences (DAS) where we presented our still rough project idea.He explained that this contributes to a buildup of phosphates in the system that doesn\u0092t happen with nitrogen.However, we learned that limestone is ineffective as it leeches phosphorus after sometime.More importantly, we started to look into possible ways to ensure safety in using E. coli to clean up water.", "modeling": "Figure 4: Concentration profiles of intracellular phosphate at equally-spaced time points in the model.Figure 3: Concentration profiles of extracellular phosphate at equally-spaced time points in the model.Two meshes are then defined: one to model phosphate concentration outside of the cells and one to model phosphate concentration within cells at all linear positions within the bioreactor at all time points for the length of the model (total running time is a preset parameter).The concentration is normalized to the instream concentration of phosphate.Additionally, the average intracellular concentration of phosphate across all cells in the bioreactor is calculated and plotted against time (Figure 5).The cells reach their maximum capacity of phosphate sooner as the flow rate slows.The overall bioreactor efficiency was also calculated at various flow rates (Figure 8).Figure 8: Bioreactor efficiency over time at various flow rates (0.5 mL/s, 1 mL/s, 5 mL/s, 10 mL/s, and 50 mL/s).As the concentration nears the maximum, the uptake rates slows and the reactor efficiency drops.To determine the overall efficiency of the reactor, the exiting concentration of phosphate is divided by the original, instream concentration, and plotted against time in Figure 6.The effect of flow rate on the bioreactor was evaluated by simulating various flowrates (Figure 7).Figure 7: Effect of flow rate on phosphate uptake over model simulation time.This assumption is valid because the genes are designed to be under constituitive control, resulting in a steady-state concentration of the membrane transport proteins.Concentration profiles of phosphate at various time points are seen in Figure 3.The profiles indicate a noticeable difference in uptake rates at various points in the reactor over time.Similarly, concentration profiles across the reactor of phosphate within the cells are plotted in Figure 4.To purpose of the model is to inform design regarding the viability of the PAO system, particularly to predict how long a single PAO reactor is useful before needing to induce the phosphate export subsystem.An analytical model using finite difference methodology was developed to predict performance of our phosphate uptake system over time.Where Cout is the extracellular phosphate concentration at position x and time t, Cin is the intracellular phosphate concentration at the same position x and time t, Cmax is the maximum phosphate capacity of the cells, and k is the phosphate uptake constant.The reactor peaks at 83.7% efficiency before decreasing as the cells near their phosphate capacity.This plot embodies the usefulness of the model, as the reactor efficiency is a measure of system performance.The concentration is normalized to the instream phosphate concentration.The concentration is normalized to the instream concentration of phosphate.The plot shows the accumulation of phosphate of the entire bioreactor over time.The maximum phosphate capacity of each differential volume slice is determined with cell density and maximum phosphate capacity per cell using Equation 4.The cellular concentration is assumed to be 108 cfu/mL and the phosphate concentration per cell is assumed to be 4*10-14 mol/cfu.Given that the width of the annuls is 0.7 cm and the flow rates are relatively low, the shear stresses are unlikely to create a large velocity gradient.It is assumed that the uptake coefficient remains constant throughout all position and time points in the model.Third, relevant parameters, namely the instream phosphate concentration, are pulled from the literature.Future iterations of the model would rely on experimental data to get a more realistic value for k, the phosphate uptake coefficient.The model is then run over the preset time parameter.Future iterations could also inform the value of k further and explicitly define it as a function of plasmid copy number, promoter strength, and other factors.pPerCell = 4E-14; % maximum phosphate concentration per

efficiency, a flow rate of 1 mL/s provides the longest lifetime of the reactor.Preliminary modeling of the system has provided a general idea of the system performance and how often filters would have to be changed for effective operation.Performance of the system was predicted using a finite difference model.It is assumed cell growth over the time course of the model is negligible and therefore is not accounted for.It is assumed flow velocity is the same at all radial positions in the reactor (perfect plug flow).The differential volume is calculated based off of the volumetric flow rate (Q) as seen in Equation 3.This enables the creation of a mesh such that an entire differential volume is moved through over the course of the discrete time step.", "notebook": "0.5\u00b5L MgCl2 was not added

transformations from yesterday, and the production of more LB agar plates with ampicillin closed out the week in Bindley Bioscience Center.This garden needed some weeding and re-planting to be in tip-top shape again.THURSDAY, JUNE 16Team members were busy in the lab completing transformations of phosphorus genes, more PCR, autoclaving, and inoculation of transformed InterLab genes.In the afternoon, a few team members also visited the West Lafayette Wastewater Treatment facility, where they learned about the local area\u0092s methods for phosphorus removal featuring their newly-implemented chemical system.THURSDAY, JULY 29Additional trials of media and various water samples were run on both the lachat and ICP as team members were trained in their use.Work continued on both the spring publication and protein profiles for the wiki.WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8 Formal lab meeting #1 was a success with the most highly prioritized goal for the upcoming week to find or generate relevant numbers for the project including necessary flow rates for a microbial fuel cell, an appropriate density of E. coli within it, etc.Further testing of the prototype will include the determination of the proper substrate to contain E. coli, optimum temperature and pH, and best water flow rate.THURSDAY, JULY 14Thursday morning began with celebration as all of the previous day\u0092s transformations worked with multiple colonies appearing on every plate.Young scientists tried their hands at pipetting, mixing colored water in eppendorf tubes.MONDAY, JULY 11After a successful weekend participating in the Wabash River Fest, the team jumped back into lab work, plating a new culture of Shewie, miniprepping a promoter for use with digestion the next day, and preparing glycerol stock cultures of successfully transformed parts.Exeter and UChicago are onboard to help with database entries and protein characterization, and SVCE will distribute a survey about wastewater management practices.Through a meeting with Dr. Ron Semmel, a Monsanto scientist, the team acquired useful contacts and information regarding local phosphorus and nitrogen soil concentrations.MONDAY, MAY 23Day 1 on the job\u0096the morning began with a tour of Bindley Bioscience Center for the new interns (Barrett, Caleigh, Emma, and Paige), during which Susan (the

for the official iGEM project wiki and a project timeline were completed in addition to an establishment of a protocol for completing lab notebooks.The day also brought continued research into the development of a model to both inform experimental decisions and make future predictions.FRIDAY, JULY 22During the week, the team found out that IDT was unable to synthesize another nanowire gene, cancelling the order and decisively tabling the wet lab work for the nanowire side of the project for this competition cycle.Look for explanation no further than the team\u0092s newly-released glossary of synthetic biology and iGEM terms hosted on the Experiment page.With the new bioreactor prototype, several protocols needed to be written including a standard for measuring water flow and a process for system maintenance.PCR products included Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK1 homolog part 1, PPK1 homolog part 2, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.PCR products included Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK1 homolog part 1, PPK1 homolog part 2, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.If lab work continues to go well, this may be something to pursue in the fall.TUESDAY, JULY 12Wet lab work consisted of the digestion and ligation of all three remaining phosphorus genes in preparation for transformations into E. coli.Performed transformations for both the 3:1 and 6:1 (insert:vector) ligations of Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.It involved the creation of a guide for phosphorus on the Experiment page, so if you want to become familiar with the differences between total phosphorus, orthophosphate, and polyphosphate, feel free to check it out.THURSDAY, JULY 21The lab hosted Peter Oladipupo, a Mandela Washington Fellow, answering questions regarding the project as it relates to the generation of energy.With equipment, it is possible to operate without reliance upon the lab space of other Bindley Bioscience Center scientists, lending additional flexibility to the projects iGEMmers are able to complete.Phosphorus genes arrived, and the team got to work on PCR amplification in the afternoon.Wiki design was also discussed to get this critical project element up and running ASAP.TUESDAY, JUNE 14Lab work for Tuesday included the mixing of gels for later electrophoresis, the miniprep of promoters that were PCR\u0092ed previously, and continued InterLab transformations.WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15Meeting day!Project write-ups for the Experiment campaign were completed, as was an application for a grant from SYNENERGENE for advanced human practices.THURSDAY, JUNE 2The Experiment online crowdfunding platform was submitted for approval in the morning, and an order for both competent cells and primers was placed.Bacterial growth was only present on the positive control, and all the transformation results came back negative.Digested Anderson promoter J23106, the ATP-independent PPGk, and PSB1A3 for 3A assembly.Ligated J23106, ATP-independent PPGK, and PSB1A3 together.Inoculated two samples of E. coli with the plasmid PBR322 and one sample of E. coli with the plasmid PACYC4 into LB.Performed minipreps on two cultures of E.

two sequence-verified transformations into PSB1A3 (PPK2 homolog C and PPX2 homolog) into LB-ampicillin.Practice minipreps were next on the agenda, which the interns also completed successfully in addition to some supply inventory.TUESDAY, MAY 31Lists of supplies needed for various assays were assembled, and an assessment of necessary ordering was made, thus finalizing the functional assays to run for both nanowire and phosphorus genes.Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog were all successful.The gel was run at room temperature and at 90 V. Bands representing the expected DNA length were present for PPK1 homolog part 2, PPX2 homolog, and PPK2 homolog C. Performed gel electrophoresis of PCR products on 1% agarose gel.If I can\u0092t kill them, they go to market.\u0094TUESDAY, JULY 5Returning from holiday, the team worked into the week with a couple of collaborative Skype calls.The conclusion of a successful first week!MONDAY, MAY 30Memorial Day was an optional day on the job, but the dedicated iGEM team put in an afternoon of work in Bindley.E. coli were added to the beads to determine whether or not they would be able to survive within the structure.WEDNESDAY, JULY 27Based on results from the lachat and ICP and the discovery that E. coli would not grow in the originally proposed Tris-HCl buffered solution, the measurement of phosphorus uptake protocol was modified after a productive meeting with advising scientists.After digestion and ligation, they did some gel electrophoresis, as well, running several different samples.MONDAY, JUNE 13Most significantly this week, team members hosted Molecular Agriculture Summer Institutes (MASI) high school students in the lab as they worked with Emma on completing InterLab protocols [InterLab is an iGEM-wide study working to establish a consistent unit of measurement for fluorescence; experimentation and measurement is completed using GFP.]The gel was run at room temperature at 90 V. Bands indicating product were present for Pit homolog A, Pit homolog C, and PPK2 homolog C.

the campaign launches June 9!MONDAY, JUNE 6Monday morning got rolling with the attendance of ABE PhD student Dr. Andi Hodaj\u0092s thesis defense regarding two-stage ditches as a tool to reduce nutrient loads.The bacteria will be immobilized within the matrix of silica fibers while phosphorus is still able to pass through, making this solution ideal for easy input and retrieval of E. coli from the bioreactor system.Interns learned how to optimize codons using IDT both automatically and manually, checking for segments such as EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI, and HINDIII that should not be present in coding regions of constructs, as these sequences code for restriction sites.WEDNESDAY, MAY 25 A review of sterile technique and iGEM kit DNA extractions in the lab comprised a majority of the morning.Phosphorus is to be collected in these chambers, and effluent is controlled by the valves at the point where water flows from the filters.It was discovered that the facility is newly permitted for phosphorus removal; however, a chemical method as opposed to a biological one will be implemented August 1 for both political and financial reasons.PCR was completed for 3 phosphorus genes whose gel electrophoresis analyses were unclear when attempted over the weekend.An afternoon Skype call with the University of Exeter in England topped off the day as teams exchanged greetings, project synopses, and ideas for future collaboration.FRIDAY, JUNE 24A Shewanella oneidensis culture, generously donated by Argonne National Laboratory, arrived amidst great celebration on Friday morning.Here\u0092s a quick summary of the goings-ons in short paragraph form:The team visited Imagination Station in downtown Lafayette regarding the possibility of volunteering both this summer and continuing forward.Corresponding with this endeavor, many bottles of Tris-HCl buffer, the media in which phosphorus-eating E. coli will be suspended, were created and autoclaved for future use.TUESDAY, JULY 26The week continued by learning to make methanol-free bioencapsulation beads using the sol-gel method.Thank you to everyone who has aided our cause!MONDAY, JUNE 20The week began with a strong focus on human practices as the team fleshed out 3 ideas.It was great fun for all parties involved as passersby learned about DNA, built (and ate) their own licorice and marshmallow double helix models, and asked questions about synthetic biology and the phosphorus cycle.With all phosphorus genes successfully transformed, the team can now move forward with characterizing proteins.A reporter from local WLFI 18 TV news visited the lab, as well, and the story, related to Florida\u0092s algal blooms, aired on the nightly news.Purdue\u0092s two-stage ditch utilized in Dr. Hodaj\u0092s was established in 2012 and drains 660 acres; it may be a possible implementation point for the project\u0092s biological method.After practice forming the beads, the team switched to a different method that could be more easily controlled and manipulated.This week, culture growth will begin after air tanks to sustain the anaerobic culture arrive.TUESDAY, JULY 19Mid-week discussion centered around using the sol-gel method to suspend E. coli in silica beads with which to fill containers external to the main containment area of the bioreactor.The team has been trying to find the proper ratio of these two ingredients so beads solidify at an appropriate rate\u0096too slowly, and an amorphous silica blob forms in the bottom of the mineral oil into which the beads drop; too quickly, and the mixture hardens inside the tubing through which it is dispensed.Analytical labs, rain-producing machines for the purpose of studying erosion patterns, bioreactors, and anaerobic growth chambers were among the cutting-edge technologies the team observed.Tweet @PurdueBiomakers to let the team know what you think.MONDAY, JULY 18In collaboration with Exeter, the team will be growing up last summer\u0092s killswitch genetic construct under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.In the best interest of keeping a sterile work environment, the team refrained from strewing confetti across the bench, although it would\u0092ve been both fun and festive.Dow AgroSciences generously donated various lab supplies to the iGEM workspace that the team was thrilled to pick up in Indianapolis on Friday morning.The plan for the upcoming week is to characterize individual proteins and begin conducting tests to determine the optimal substrate for E. coli to inhabit in the bioreactor\u0092s external chambers.They are excited about the project and are looking into Chicago-area venues as the Purdue team investigates Indianapolis as a potential host city.The remainder of the day was spent working on gene design via Benchling, researching potential assays, and meeting with Drs.Additionally, the team is excited to announce that their submission for a SYNENERGENE Grant-Funded Collaboration proposal was selected!The gel was run at room temperature and at 90 V. Performed digestion and ligation (both 3:1 and 5:1) on the Anderson promoter J23106, six of our phosphorus-related genes, and PSB1A3.Transformed the six phosphorus-gene constructs ligated yesterday into E. coli, .Nanowires will be revisited during the school year\u0096strong side project potential!MONDAY, JULY 25Preliminary trials of testing for phosphorus using the lachat and the ICP-OES at the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory began.The rest of the afternoon was spent working on action items from the meeting and printing the spring publication, which is FINISHED.THURSDAY, JUNE 9Team members Barrett Davis, Paige Rudin, and Suraj Mohan attended the Regional Clean Energy Innovation Forum held at Ross-Ade Stadium.If this event is pursued, it would be a day-long conference at the end of July.The third idea is in regards to the Great North American Skype Series (G-NASS), a \u0093Skype roulette\u0094 to foster inter-team communication.Cool temperatures slow the reaction, so the team has also tried completing the process in the cold room with mineral oil warmed on a hot plate, but to no avail.Some golden rules of sterile technique: Always wipe down the lab bench with 70% ethanol before beginning; work as close to the flame as possible, as it creates a sterile \u0093bubble\u0094; and get into and out of pipette tip boxes as quickly as possible to keep them sterile.Interns followed an existing protocol to make plain LB agar, LB agar with ampicillin, and LB broth, culminating in the pouring and storing of too many plates to count.Additionally, the team met with representatives of the Purdue Foundry regarding the possibility of developing a business model for the phosphorus removal system.See last week\u0092s previous post for more information; the Experiment page can be found here.The first, iNAC, the iGEM North American Conference, was sparked by the observation that many more European than North American teams medal, and of those that medal, the proportion of golds is substantially higher for Europe.The theme the team took away from the day is best summarized with the words of Purdue President Mitch Daniels during his opening remarks: \u0093It\u0092s only an innovation when it\u0092s useful to someone.\u0094 How can new technology of nanowires and microbial fuel cells be integrated efficiently into established systems?Additionally, the hunt for assays continued for both phosphorus and nanowire constructs.The lachat measures orthophosphate, or soluble reactive phosphorus, while the ICP measures total phosphorus, the entirety of phosphorus contained in a sample.Due to low concentrations below 45 ng/\u00b5L, the colonies containing these plasmids were reinoculated.Performed minipreps on two cultures of E. coli containing the plasmid PBR322 and one sample of PACYC4.A graduate student in the lab worked with team members to describe and demonstrate the protocol.Transformations were done into E. coli.Inoculated transformations of the temperature sensitive promoter K608351 and tsPurple reporter (RBS+coding+terminator) K1357008 into LB-chloramphenicol.Inoculated successful transformations from October 9 into LB- chloramphenicol.", "protocol": "in a hood or near a flame) do NOT use heat to dry the smear because cells might popOnce dry, pass slide through a flame 1-2 times to fix cells to the glass slideEnsure the cells do not come into contact with the flame, only the underside of the slide (slide should be just hot enough that you can hold it in your hands without causing burns)Completely cover the smear with Solution 1 for 30 seconds and rinse for 1 sec with ddH2OCompletely cover the smear with Solution 2 for 1 minute, rinse well with ddH2O and blot dry.Examine under oil immersion using the 100X objective with brightfield illumination (do not use phase contrast)If using EVOS, do not use any fluorescent illumination--natural light will workWritten up by Barrett Davis, Emma Foster, and Paige RudinTo prepare E. coli cultures for phosphorus uptake characterizationGrow up cells in LB Broth with shaking at 37\u00b0C for 12h (25 mL)Pipette 100 uL into a well;

Cm- 35 micrograms /ml, Kan- 50micrograms/ml, Tet- 5 microgram/mlInnoculate with the required amount and incubate the flasks at 37 degrees and 220 rpm.Each morning and evening, take the OD of the culture and add to a fresh flask as before to reach a starting OD of 0.05 again.Residual agarose will solidify quickly in the flask.Let the solution cool and solidify into a gel.If you have multiple bands, you might have to optimize the PCR protocol or gel extract the correct band or both.After you figure out the optimal PCR conditions, you can do more than one 50 uL reaction to keep as stockDon t use all of the original G Block stock.If a sample volume is greater than the column, perform multiple applications and centrifugations until the entire sample has been processed.Note: Use 2.0, 15 or 50mL centrifuge tubes for the 0.2, 1 and 3mL spin columns, respectively.Calculate the amount of overnight culture you need to add to get a starting OD of 0.05 in 50 ml of mediaPut 50 ml of the media (one of LB and one of No salt LB) into 250ml erlenmeyer flasks and add antibiotics for the control you are using to the recommended iGEM concentration.This will keep the culture going.Take a sample from the culture and make a glycerol stock using 0.5ml of sample and 0.5ml of 50% glycerol every day in week 1 and every two days in week 2 (this is what we are doing if it\u0092s too much then however is fine).An electric field can be used to pull DNA through an agarose gel matrix because the phosphate backbone in DNA is negatively charged.Centrifuge the column at 700 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes and collect the flow-through in a centrifuge tube.Wash resin with two resin-bed volumes of Wash Buffer.A molecular weight marker (DNA ladder) containing DNA fragments of known length can be used to determine the size (in base pairs) of the DNA samples run on the gel.If it is orange or purple, add 10 uL 3M sodium acetate until the mixture turns yellow.Then, add one mL of the prepared sulfuric acid solution and 0.4 grams of ammonium persulfate to the solution.Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg gel ~ 100 uL).The migration rate of the DNA fragments will depend on the density of agarose in your gel.Collected solution at the bottom of the tube is the purified DNA.When the flask is cool enough to hold add antibiotic, pour into plates, and let cool.Take 300 \u00b5l of the aqueous phase in a fresh test tube.Elute His-tagged proteins from the resin by adding one resin-bed volume of Elution Buffer.The top of the cell containers should be marked to show use, and each Eppendorf tube should be labeled with the part name of control.Add to the Erlenmeyer flask.Add 1 drop phenolphthalein indicator.The digested sample is then tested for total phosphate as outlined in

project and is quite a lot of work so adapt this as you like to fit it in.LB broth recipe for 1 litre is 10g Tryptone, 5g Yeast extract, 10g NaClNo salt LB is as above but No NACl (we are doing this as we can\u0092t find a reason for having salt in LB and are interested to see the growth characteristics)Transform your killswitch into whichever strain is best for your killswitch and overnight a colony in 5 ml of LB broth.Take the OD in triplicate of the overnight and get an average.For smaller volumes of liquid, the smaller-toothed comb wells can hold about 7 ?L.When the agarose cools such that you can hold the flask easily in the palm of your hand, pour the solution into an electrophoresis tray.Add 30?L elution buffer to center of spin column membrane, let stand for 1min, then centrifuge for 1min (room temp, 13000rpm).Pipette 100 ?l of each sample into each well of the clear plate and then 100 ul of sample into each well of the black plate.Note, the gels run only half as far so there is a hit in resolution.Loosely plug the mouth of the flask with a couple of Kimwipes to prevent excessive water loss during microwaving.Microwave the flask in the lab microwave for 70-80 seconds.Transfer mixture to a QIAquick spin column and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000rpm.Smaller pieces of DNA will move faster through the gel than larger pieces.Centrifuge the column for 1 min again to remove residual wash buffer.This protocol was retrieved from a document by the Iowa Rural Water Association entitled \"Filamentious Bacteria Identification & Process Control: A Simple Approach\" [http://www.iowaruralwater.org/tools_tips/toni_glymp/Filaments.pdf].Next, add 750 \u00b5L Buffer PE, centrifuge for 1 minute, and then discard the flow-through.If you are planning on running samples larger than 15 ?L on the gel (about what one large-toothed comb well will hold), you can carefully tape together multiple teeth on the well comb together to create a larger well.The liquid should be discarded and then liquid cell culture should be added to the Eppendorf tube with the remaining pellet.Bubbles can be removed by sucking them up using a pipet.Immediately rinse out the flask that contained the hot agarose with water.Mix by gentle vortexing and incubate for 15 minutes at 25\u00b0C till the colour of the solution changes from blue to purple.CRITICAL STEP: The change in colour implies that polyphosphate is successfully extracted and is present in the aqueous phase.Set the thermocycler to the following settings: 98\u00b0C for 30 seconds, then 25 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, TM- 5\u00b0C for 30s, 72\u00b0C for 30s, and end with 72\u00b0C for 5 min and then 4\u00b0C forever.Add a drop of phenolphthalein to the sample and, if the sample turns red, add drops sulfuric acid

already running effluent stream and immediately begin timing for 10 seconds.Centrifuge column at 700 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes to remove buffer.If you have just your desired band, you can clean up the rest of your sample with the Qiagen PCR cleanup kit.Once the gel has solidified, gently remove the well comb from the gel.Transfer the gel tray into an electrophoresis chamber.Centrifuge column at 700 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes to remove storage buffer.Remove the bottle from the stream at 10 seconds, DO NOT close the valve at 10 seconds.Be careful not to generate any bubbles in the molten agarose.As a general rule of thumb, the time affects the migration distance \u0096 shorter times equal shorter migration distances and lower resolutions.The agarose should not dissolve in the TAE at this point.This has two key objectives.With standard 1 cm pathlength spectrophotometers, the reading is still instrument dependent (see above).Swirl the plate to move the glass beads around and evenly coat the media with the liquid suspension of cells.Add this amount of water to a PCR tube.Transfer competent cells to ice from the -80? freezer.The side of the gel with the wells should be facing towards the black side (anode) of the chamber.If a red color develops, add sulfuric acid solution until color just disappears.Add 1 mL of sulfuric acid solution and 0.4 g of ammonium persulfate.Adjust as necessary, but beware that pH will drop with the next step.To measure your standard LUDOX Abs600 you must use the same cuvettes, plates and volumes (suggestion: use 100 ?l for plate reader measurement and 1 mL for spectrophotometer measurement) that you will use in your cell based assays.Scatter the cell suspension in drops on the plate.Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge

overnight.[Note: it is important that the FITC is properly dissolved.Using this and the other given volumes, calculate amount of nuclease free water to be added (for 1?L of DNA solution this is 32?L of nuclease free water).Repeat this step again then measure final DNA concentrations with a Nanodrop machine, using EB Buffer as a blank.However, the migration rate is not linearly related to the fragment size so different gel densities yield different resolutions.Incubate for 4 min.Note: The buffers listed below are recommended.Using the hot plate, boil the solution gently for 30 to 40 minutes, when the total volume is 10 mL.Ensure the water level in the bioreactor is staying at the constant level around the overflow port before opening any outlet streams.If sequences don t match up

Equilibration Buffer to adjust the total volume to be ? 2 resin-bed volumes.After about a minute, move tubes around in ice because the nearby ice has probably melted.We are not allowed in the lab before nine or after five thirty so these are the times we will be doing it but whatever suits you is fine.Repeat the previous step and centrifuge for 2 minutes to remove residual wash buffer.Add distilled water to bring the total volume back to 50 mL.First, add LyseBlue to Buffer P1 at a ratio of 1:1000.Hit the Run button to start running the gel.Alternative: For more throughput or shorter run times, 2 half gels (2 sets of combs per gel) can be run at a setting of 110V, 30 min.However, with the optics on the imager, the effects of this are negligible.Next, add 4 \u00b5L of DNA were to

dissolve approximately 0.21 grams of agarose powder in 30 mL of 1X TAE in an Erlenmeyer flask or other microwaveable vessel.", "result": "The suitability of the linear regression is also supported by the root mean square error, which, at 0.02, is relatively close to 0.Figure 6: the results indicate that the samples for E. coli containing PPK2 C (both PSB1C3 and PSB1A3), PPX2 (both PSB1C3 and PSB1A3), and PPGK accumulate less polyphosphate than unmodified E. coli, and samples for E. coli containing Pit homolog A and PPGK ATPI accumulate more polyphosphate than the unmodified E. coli.The results, reflective of 72 hours of E. coli suspension in Tris-HCl buffered minimal media, indicate that PPX2 effectively exported phosphorus from the cell compared to the exportation of phosphorus from unmodified E. coli because PPX2 culture demonstrated a higher extracellular phosphorus concentration.Figure 5A standard curve for amount of phosphate per 300 \u00b5l of solution was generated using sodium phosphate glass type 45.No forward primer was used, as we did not have a forward primer that would work for PSB1A3 at the time of sequencing.Figure 3.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformation of PPK2 homolog C in the plasmid PSB1A3 indicate that PPK2 homolog C plasmid has the correct sequence.The sequencing for plasmids in the PSB1C3 backbone were done with the standard BioBrick primers VR and VF2.PPGK ATPI is not working as expected, as PPGK ATPI, like PPGK, transfers a phosphate group from polyphosphate to glucose.In the future, we should extract polyphosphate granules from a large sample of unmodified E. coli in order to obtain a normal distribution curve to which our modified samples could be compared.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformations of PPX2 homolog in the plasmid PSB1A3 indicate that the PPX2 homolog contains the correct sequence.Analysis of Phosphorus Uptake, Accumulation, and ExportationFigure 4: The amount of extracellular total phosphorus in Tris-HCl buffered minimal media after extended 72-hour phosphorus transportation assay with E. coli.Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to quantify the importation and exportation of phosphorus by modified and unmodified E. coli with results detailed in Figure 4.The sequencing for plasmids in the PSB1A3 backbone were done with a reverse primer that targets the his operon terminator on PSB1A3, and so the reaction should proceed, regardless of whether or not an insert was present in the plasmid.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformations of PPX2 homolog in the plasmid PSB1C3 indicate that the PPX2 homolog contains the correct sequence.Figure 3.c.Unmodified E. coli served as a negative control to which PPX2 in PSB1A3 backbone was compared.Figure 1: Transformation of PPX2 homolog on PSB1A3 plasmid into E. coli grown on an LB agar plate with ampicillin.Figure 2: Transformation of PPK2 homolog C on PSB1A3 plasmid into E. coli grown on an LB agar plate with ampicillin.Figure 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate the growth of modified E. coli on LB agar plates containing ampicillin.The coefficient of determination (R2), at 0.975, is relatively close to 1, which indicates that the linear regression is a suitable equation for estimating the relationship between concentration of polyphosphate and absorbance at 630 nm.Meanwhile, these results also suggest that Pit A is working as expected, as Pit A is predicted to transport phosphate into the cell.This antibiotic was shown to be effective in controlling the growth of bacteria that did not take up the modified plasmid with antibiotic resistance, as no growth was found on the negative control.The success of these transformations, as confirmed through plasmid sequencing, is discussed below.Plasmid DNA was then obtained for colonies resulting from transformations and brought to the Purdue Genomics Core Facility for low throughput Sanger sequencing.While PPK2 homolog C\u0092s preference for polyphosphate hydrolysis or synthesis is unknown, the low concentration of polyphosphate in cells containing PPK2 homolog C suggests that PPK2 C favors polyphosphate hydrolysis to phosphorylate nucleoside diphosphates (or nucleoside monophosphates).", "safety": "In its application, the main goals of Purdue iGEM\u0092s phosphate

sequencing of DNA samples from ambulance vehicles, antibodies targeting important pathogens were then used to develop a rapid and low cost ELISA-based testing kit that may be employed on-site by EMS workers.Our project provides a framework for rapid detection of emergent pathogens and a practical and rapid solution for monitoring their presence in and outside of the healthcare system.Our iGEM team developed a custom bacterial two hybrid system to select single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that recognize human pathogens.", "design": "Therefore, our engineered solution must satisfy the following design principles: 1) comprehensive; provide a complete picture of the vehicle microbiome, 2) portable; a detection tool that could be transferred to different vehicles, while the overall solution could be implemented around the globe, 3) easy to use; no additional training would be required of the first responders (i.e.All four samples were acquired weekly from 3 ambulances over one deep clean cycle for a total of 48 samples to be sequenced (link to sampling protocol).The acquired samples were then prepared for the MinION, which included DNA amplification, barcoding and adapter ligation (link to sample prep protocol).From the literature review (link back to literature review), we discovered that no sequencing approach had been used to assess the types of pathogens in ambulances.Specifically, we needed to design a system that would: 1) determine what pathogens are present in the vehicles and 2) verify the vehicle is decontaminated.Sample locations were chosen based on information obtained from the literature, our observations during ride-alongs and areas of high concern indicated by first responders (link back to sampling protocol).The completed reads were then mapped to a database, allowing for the identification of different types of pathogens within a sample obtained from the EMS vehicles.Overall, we have successfully generated an approach that is robust in the detection and identification of potentially harmful pathogens which is generalizable to a multitude of situations around the world.This information could be used to provide a baseline measurement of the vehicle microbiome, followed by subsequent sequencing to monitor cleaning habits over an extended period of time.One issue with using antibody based detection methods is the cost and time associated with developing antibodies to bind to specific targets of interest.From the sequence alignment, we could identify commonalities between sdAbs and identify highly conserved amino acids at specific positions in order to reduce our sequence search space.surface proteins of pathogens identified in the sequencing results) and used to develop a specific colorimetric assay.The results of the sequencing analysis provided a comprehensive picture of pathogens contained within EMS vehicles.Areas of the vehicle where blood, vomit and other bodily fluids are visible are cleaned thoroughly, but what about areas where there is no obvious contamination?Another issue brought to our attention by the EMS was that some of their disinfectant products kill only a fraction of the pathogenic material, while the remaining viable pathogens spread to other areas and possibly transfer to hospitals or the community.Moreover, our group has adapted the generation of sdAbs into an easy-to-use, extremely rapid test kit based on an ELISA for day-to-day monitoring of the pathogen load of an EMS vehicle.Using this information, as well as what we learned from the literature (link to lit review), interviews (link to interview), and ride-alongs (link to ride-alongs), we designed a two-pronged approach to evaluate these concerns.As this was not feasible for our project, we decided to explore an alternative approach using single domain antibodies (sdAbs), derived from camelid heavy chain antibodies and consisting only of the variable heavy chain domain (VHH).The fluorescent reporter construct allows for strong and weak binders to be sorted using a fluorescently activated cell sorter (FACS).The design of our project adopted a two-pronged approach for identifying and detecting various pathogens within EMS vehicles.Moving forward, a significant amount of value lies in the standardization of our approach.This issue brought to our attention by our local Fire Department and EMS has the potential to be a national case study with regards to cleaning standards.First responders could then swab a surface and use this assay to easily and rapidly observe a color change to identify if the pathogen was present.We have described an approach to provide a comprehensive picture of the vehicle microbiome.quick response time) and 6) specific; accurate in regards to the types of pathogens identified and detected.We were approached by the Lethbridge Fire Department and EMS to investigate the microbiome of their vehicles and to provide a direct assessment of their cleaning protocols.Most importantly our solution is designed to be used by the individuals on the front lines, the first responders; this is why we have made our ELISA-based test system easily adaptable and ready to use without any special training required.Given that the sequencing platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies is an emerging technology, errors in sequencing do occur.Currently, the vehicles are cleaned on a daily basis or as needed, and undergo a more extensive deep clean once a month.As such, to get a comprehensive picture of what is contained within these vehicles we decided on a sequencing approach.This database would offer a resource for researchers to easily identify sdAbs that bind to specific targets for a variety of applications (link to database).Informed by our database, we performed a bioinformatics analysis and sequence alignment using a subset of sdAb sequences (~40 sequences) [3].\u0093paramedic proof\u0094), 4) standardized; develop protocols and methods that could be duplicated by others for similar or related applications, 5) rapid; first responders could quickly identify pathogens (i.e.To overcome this, and to make our approach much more accurate, our two pronged-solution includes highly specific detection based on antibody recognition.Given a certain threshold, in the case an opportunistic pathogen was detected, the necessary steps would need to be taken (i.e.Prior to our library design, we developed a sdAb database to provide a repository of publicly available sequences.We chose to sample the bottom of soft kits, the interior door handle, and SPO2 finger monitor.Our standard parts for generating a sdAb library are also available in the iGEM registry for use by any future iGEM team.Therefore, based on the amino acid conservation we can narrow our search space for only relevant combinations.Similarly, for amino acid positions that are more variable only the residues most likely to occur at this position were tested for rather than using all possible 20 amino acids.This highlighted the benefit of our approach over more conventional cell culturing techniques which could not identify these species.Additionally, these synthetic libraries allow for an assortment of variants to be selected for, increasing the possibility of a strong binder to be identified.Looking only at CDR3, which is the variable region most important for conveying specificity, there are approximately 1011 sequence combinations.One potential tool would be an antibody based detection method, such as an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).We were able to develop a new, standardized method of sample preparation for a cutting-edge sequencing platform.", "human_practice": "Overall, the ride alongs helped us understand what locations would be the best to sample for potential pathogens.After careful consideration of what locations were sampled in the literature, the suggestions we received from paramedics and observations from ride alongs, we chose the following areas:1) The bottom of a soft kit kept in the ambulance: this was chosen because it is used on every call that the EMS handle.We had the following objectives in mind during our ride alongs: to understand the daily cleaning techniques of the ambulances, to choose potential sampling locations, and to see first hand the types of calls that can happen in a night.While speaking to first responders, we learned about what products they currently use to clean the ambulances.Nitrile gloves were worn by team members taking samples and 70% ethanol was used to sterilize gloves and the tweezers, which were used to remove the filter paper from the centrifuge tube after each location was sampled.Many handles were chosen as sampling locations in the literature review, such as the side door handle or handles found on the interior cupboards.3) SPO2 finger monitor: we chose this location because patients come into direct contact with the SPO2 finger monitor, as it is needed to keep track of their vitals until they can be transferred to a health care facility.Following our abstract exploration, we sought practical understanding of the ambulance environemnt.After completing our literature review, members of our team went on ride alongs with EMS to understand their processes better and to further our knowledge on picking the best locations to sample.We also found out that the deep cleans occur when the ambulances are still on call.During the calls, we looked for potential spots that could be reservoirs for pathogens based on what we saw paramedics and patients touch.Large KimWipes were used to dry the gloves before the next location was sampled.The first area that was sampled was the SPO2 finger monitor located in the heart rate monitor kit.Each kit consisted of a sterile pair of tweezers, Large KimWipes, Nitrile gloves, 70% ethanol and 12 microcentrifuge tubes (4 per ambulance).Sampling took place at the main Fire Station in downtown Lethbridge over the course of one month.These bags are also rarely replaced because of their durability.2) The rear back door handle: this handle is touched by the paramedics who use the ambulance throughout the day and also by some patients who are moved into the ambulance using this door.Many of the paramedics mentioned that this might be a potential hot spot for pathogens.These wipes are also used during monthly deep cleanings of the ambulances.Our project provides a framework for rapid detection of emergent pathogens and a practical and rapid solution for monitoring their presence in and outside of the healthcare system.Prior to sampling, sample kits were prepared in house.It is often the last area touched by a paramedic after moving a patient into the ambulance.The filter paper was then carefully placed back in the centrifuge tube.The gloves and tweezers were cleaned with ethanol between samples.They mainly use cleaning wipes, called Caviwipes, to wipe down the ambulance after each call.The filter paper was removed from the centrifuge tube, then the bottom part of the finger monitor that the finger is inserted into was swiped.This process was repeated for sampling of the rear door handle and bottom of the soft kit.All three ambulances were on call while the sampling took place.Extra precautions were put in place in order to maintain sterility and avoid sample contamination.Deep cleanings involve removing some equipment from the ambulance to get at areas that cannot be cleaned easily during daily cleaning.The bottom of this kit is made of nylon, which can trap dirt from any of the geographic locations that it is transported to.In the biological safety cabinet, 500 L of 70% sterile ethanol was pipetted into 2 mL centrifuge

with cutting-edge hardware and software from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.We were then able to overexpress the lambda cI fused to the CDR library.This facilitates the identification of tight antibody binding which is detected as a fluorescent signal.However, utilizing next-generation sequencing, identification of these microbes in emergency medical vehicles and in the environment at large would be possible.The CDRs confer the specificity of binding, and a large library of possible sequences facilitates panning for single-domain antibodies with specificity for any given antigen.These plasmids were transformed into DH5?

genetically mating types, + and \u0096 alleles of a mating type complex.The unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is known as a model organism, the first strains were isolated about 60 years ago (1).The algae diverged from land plants over one billion years ago and comes from a linage of Viridiplantae.", "design": "Instead, the sgRNA was designed to guide Cas9 to the 12-kD FK506-binding protein gene in C. reinhardtii, allowing rapamycin resistance as a selection marker for successful gene knockout.This gene encodes the rapamycin binding protein FKBP12.Even though, this knockout strain is not more productive than other strains from an overall perspective due to its reduced growth rate.We believe the ultimate C. reinhardtii strain for biofuel production would have the growth rate of a wild type and the fatty acid accumulation of the sta6 null strain, and our hypothesis is that this could be accomplished with an inducible knockout system.Since the purpose of this DNA construct was to prove the functionality of CRISPR/Cas9 in C. reinhardtii, the sgRNA does not target a metabolic gene.Park S, Lee Y, Lee J-H, Jin E. Expression of the high light-inducible Dunaliella LIP promoter in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.We yet decided to use it, mainly because of the lack of other alternatives and the great effort of optimizing it ourselves, and because only a very low Cas9 expression should be required to enable target gene knockout.By inducing the expression of Cas9 in C. reinhardtii at the biomass peak, before nitrogen starvation, more TAG-bodies would accumulate without affecting the growth rate of the algae.Our construct is designed to demonstrate the functionality of an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in C. reinhardtii.The construct is thought to convey inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of a specific metabolic target gene, directing the cells flux of carbon sources towards triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis.Knockout of metabolic target genes in C. reinhardtii has been successfully performed many times before.For example, knocking out the sta6 gene in C. reinhardtii, encoding the starch synthesis enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, results in accumulation of 20\u00a0% less biomass during nutrient-replete conditions (2).Lastly, we have a hygromycin resistance gene (aph7), serving as selection marker for successful transformation of C. reinhardtii.The construct is constituted by six DNA fragments, assembled by Gibson assembly and designed accordingly.The function of the last fragment is to enable selection of successfully transformed colonies of C. reinhardtii.Inhibition of target of rapamycin signaling by rapamycin in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Theoretically, the YFP reporter gene could also serve as a selection marker, therefore we continued with the primer design.Despite multiple attempts, the assembly has not been fully successful, yet.Baek K, Lee Y, Nam O, Park S, Sim SJ, Jin E. Introducing Dunaliella LIP promoter containing light-inducible motifs improves transgenic expression in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.There are several variants of inducible promoters that could be used in C. reinhardtii to express a gene such as Cas9 at given stimuli, and many of these promoters include addition and removal of chemicals.Metabolic and photosynthetic consequences of blocking starch biosynthesis in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sta6 mutant.The path to triacylglyceride obesity in the sta6 strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.A protein sensitive to rapamycin, naturally occurring in plants, including the algae of interest, C. reinhardtii (7).It includes of a codon optimized hygromycin resistance gene, Aph7, which can be used as a selection marker (8).Despite that the use of a light-inducible knockout promotor in a photosynthetic organism might seem contradictory, it has its advantages due to its manageability.2015 Apr [cited 2016 Sep 4];99(8):3491\u0096503.2013 Dec [cited 2016 Sep 4];238(6):1147\u009656.Goncalves EC, Wilkie AC, Kirst M, Rathinasabapathi B.

and its inhibition induces cell death.But so far, the outcome of these knockouts has not been algal strains producing enough biomass and lipids to be profitable for biodiesel production (1).Due to the potential complexity of using chemicals for this purpose, we decided to use high-intensity light as promotor stimulus.An insert that appeared to be correct was transformed into C. reinhardtii but selection failed, and the insert later proved to be wrong (see results).1.The theoretical functionality of this part is questionable due to its lack of codon optimization for C. reinhardtii.4-5. sgRNA

colonies with the proper base length were sequenced and it could be determined that Cas9 and LIP had successfully been inserted into the vector, whilst sgRNA, U6 and Hygromycin cassette (Hyg) were not incorporated.The constructed vector, which included YFP instead of Hyg, was transformed into the algae with electroporation.Furthermore, three constructs with the fragments LIP, LIP-RFP and terminator were successfully obtained.A big part of LiU iGEM\u0092s project is the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.However, the effectivity of this method was quite low and the approach on the assembly needed to be modified.Since no hygromycin resistant could be utilized everything grew on the plates and there was no selection on the plates.The colonies were screened with fluorescent microscope, but because of the difficulties to detect YFP the conclusion was that the electroporation was not successful.", "safety": "To ensure no mutated bacteria or algae got outside the lab, each laborant sterilized their hands aswell as the lab bench they were working with.For chemicals that had a pungent odor (i.e acetic acid), or was poisonous (i.e hygromycin), or for any other type of hazards, we handled these chemicals under a fume hood with nitrile gloves and saftey glasses with outmost care.iGEM has two major guidelines for laboratory work during a project: No genetically modified organisms should be released outside the lab.The first guideline does not apply since all our parts and organisms are classified as riskgroup 1 at the highest.This rule becomes especially crucial if the organism is classified as a GMO.The question therefore follows; should our projcet be considered as GMO?Yes we do have a genetically modified eukaryotic organism, however despite it being genetically modifed, by defintion it is not to be considered as GMO since we have been using CRISPR/Cas9 system to cut a gene without inserting new DNA.Residues of Hutners trace elements, which contained the heavy metals cobalt(II) and copper(II) were disposed of in a waste container for heavy metals.It is of outmost importance that the products that you ship for sequencing or to the registry are transported in a safe and secure manner.The chassis we are using are a non-pathogenic XL-1 blue E.coli strain and all the parts included are unharmful to humans and other organisms.The main project challenge was to ensure that our genetically modified C.reinhardtii would not pose any threat to other wild type algae.The FDA [1], as well as the swedish agriculture department [2] considers the use of CRISPR/Cas9 not to be GMO if you use the system only to cut a gene.At LiU iGEM our main concern has always been safety.Since we were using risk group 1 organisms we were working on a lab bench and always wearing lab coats, saftey glasses and latex/nitrile gloves.This is especially true since our goal is to eventually modify the chloroplast, which, when modfied will severly weaken C.reinhardtii to grow outside in the wild.To assure that no modified C.reinhardtii would escape into the wild this system will be activated by light, so that ordinary sunlight would be sufficient to shut down the organism.Saftey is paramount when working in the laboratory, and this project is no expection.Even if the algae did not belong to any risk group, they were treated as though they are risk group 1 organisms.But, since our parts were sequenced in Germany the shipment to that destination will be discussed here.When our parts were ready to be sequenced we contacted our secondary PI, which had contacts with a sequence company and asked for help with sending it to the company.Careful considerations must be taken when it comes to shipping of biological parts, it would be rather careless and unfriendly for the environment if a gene or a biological part got damaged or leaked out due to improper care during transport.The results usually came after 1 week, which was the standard time, indicating there were no problems with shipment regarding the sequencing matter.1.Since our parts where shipped after the wiki freeze we can not tell about any specifics about how the shipment went for the parts to iGEM:s headquarters.However, we modify a species, C. reinhardtii, which can be applied to the second guideline.", "keywords": "reinhardtii anthocyanin hypotaurine chloroplast examinations Chlamydomonas

"The concept of our project was to first delete B. subtilis\u0092s BB, and replace its SBP and ABC transporter by the ones of P. larvae.We finally chose bee excrements where P. larvae is still present, which will not be a big concern regarding public opinion and finally which is not invasive.We based our detection system on the iron uptake system of P. larvae and we chose Bacillus subtilis to detect it since they both have a similar iron regulation system.For instance, during low iron concentrations conditions in the extracellular environment, P. larvae and B. subtilis produce iron chelating agents, known as siderophores, and in our case it is the bacillibactin (BB).BB is a catechol-based siderophore-secreted by members of the genus Bacillus (antracis, subtilis).The amount of intracellular iron in B. subtilis will increase with the use of P. larvae\u0092s BB, which will activates FUR and therefore repress LacI.This chain of events will lead to the expression of our pigment, silent in normal conditions, indicating the presence of P. larvae.In a lab settings, the ideal would be to test our modified bacteria simply with P. larvae\u0092s BB instead of working with the pathogen itself.On one hand, the idea being that by putting our modified B. subtilis in the same environment, B. subtilis will be forced to use the P. larvae siderophore which is possible now with the help of the ABC transporter and SBP specific to P. larvae.For the sake of a proof of concept, we modified our system where we will instead remove all other iron uptake system, and its own BB from B. subtilis.If our bacteria changes color, it would indicate that they were able to take up the BB from the unmodified B. subtilis, and also that our pigment expression system is functional.Other factors than pathogens can indicate beehives health.We went from the basic idea of P. larvae detection system with a promotor repressed by a transcription factor in normal condition.Those factors include the bee pathogen Paenibacillus larvae, heavy metals levels, and sugar levels, which will all be detected in bees  excrements.We chose to use bees\u0092 excrements for testing as it is the less invasive solution we found.The other being that the pigment may not be as visible as we would expect in the living organism plus larvae\u0092s cells are closed at some point and even if they do change color we won\u0092t be able to observe it.On the other hand, we want to put a pigment under a LacI promotor (for example), itself being regulated by FUR.With the presence of the component to detect, that transcription factor will no longer block the expression of the pigment, thus the staining of B. subtilis.It is involved in the chelation of ferric iron (Fe3+) from the surrounding environment and is subsequently transferred into the bacterial cytoplasm via the use of ABC transporters and siderophore binding proteins (SBP).In the presence of Fe, FUR, a negative transcription factor, dimerizes upon iron II binding and inhibits its target genes expression.In this case the color change could be observable in the living bees but we encountered two issues.Once in the intracellular environment, first the Fe3+ is converted into Fe2+ then the FUR (Ferric Iron Regulator) takes over.Our idea is to create a system that could be adapted to study any type of factors we are interested in by simply using the same system but each time modifying promotors to make it specific to the factor of interest.", "human_practice": "Our \"Bee subtilis\" put in a free iron media, would only be able activate the production of blue pigment when the defecation contains P. larvae.Finally as we send survey to beekeepers to ask them about our project (here) and after what Mr. Lecompte told us (here).Futhermore, he explained to us that our system wouldn t give any useful informations as one bee, carying our \"Bee subtilis\", wouldn t be representative of the entire hive health.The project evolved into something more beekeepers friendly and closer to reality, as we decided to use our modified bacteria as an external bio sensor.Inside of the bees guts, our \"Bee subtilis\" would be able to grow only in the presence of P. larvae (as the bees  guts are poor in free Fe2+ iron,\"Bee subtilis\" needs the siderophore of P. larvae to grow).We put the target sequence of FUR next to a LacI sequence that we introduced into our \"Bee subtilis\", the lacI would inhibate the expression of a pigment, which mean that in the presence of P. larvae, \"Bee subtilis\" is going to produce a pigment, easily observable by beekeepers, that would color bees.At this point, everything was pretty set.The idea was to insert the receptors specific to the siderophore of P. larvae into our B. subtilis (after deleting its own siderophore receptors).We decided that the best, to help beekeepers have better knowledge of the health statuts of their hives, would be to mesure several factors (as

to spread synthetic biology through workshops and informative talks.Thanks to the activities that the group developed and others that were attended by them, was possible to contact with people interested in being part of the project and very committed to the tasks involved in developing it.Finally we formed the Team iGEM Uchile-OpenBio, we all feel part of the team and if you want to know more about the members of the team we invite you to see our 4000 USD.That team was founded on December 2013 by Luis Rodriguez and Pablo Troncoso (we miss you!).Ignacio Ardiles and Luis Rodriguez created a Sponsorship letter offering to the institutions being our sponsors.Centre for Biotechnology and Bioengineering (CeBiB) is a center of excellence in frontier research by an interdisciplinary team composed of renowned national and international, able to investigate key issues of modern biotechnology and bioengineering, including important applications in industry.", "background": "", "description": "", "design": "", "human_practice": "For example, if we suppose a constant production of the same amount of PLA and PET (a fossil plastic), after 5 years, higher amounts of PET would b expected to be found because a percentage of PLA should be degraded in the first two years[5] .Here you can see the article written on the websites of Mariano de Schoenstatt high school, and La Maisonnette high school.We also particularly want to thank the Chilean National Commission of Cooperation with UNESCO, which provided us its support to realize this activity through a letter (download here) Last year, for the first time, was implemented an optional course of Synthetic Biology in the Engineering Faculty, that everyone from the different Departments could take.But if PLA had a short degradation time, we guess people would replace it more frequently by buying more PA products, so higher amounts of PLA could be thrown away and the accumulation rate would increase.This was useful to wonder, for example:  After analysing and debating this problem, our main discussions and conclusions were:A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis would bring us a lot of quantitative information about our project, because it would make us know the specific impacts of the production process in term of equivalent CO2 (carbon dioxide) generation[1] .The team also elaborated an electronic glossary to make sure that the concepts wouldn\u0092t be forgotten after the activity.As it was the first time that such an activity was implemented, the team asked for students  and teachers  feedback, in order to improve the pedagogical material for the next collaboration with an educational institution.If you are interested in knowing more about how the activity was received, here you can read some comments and see a video recorded at the end of the last activity.We want to thank the two high schools we worked with, for the coordination of the activity and the opportunity they gave us to make the pupils discover this new method: Synthetic Biology.According to the previous reflection, we recommend to use PLA for products which will have a short life-time (<2 years), for example plastic cups or bags.He added that if we could demonstrate our fabrication process is cheaper than the current ones, the project would turn very attractive for many digital fabrication laboratories, for he gave us his support at the end of the visit, sending us another letter of inquiry.We reached the Government through the Ministry of the Environment, which manifested its interest through a letter of inquiry, in which it recognizes the importance of \u0093the fabrication of biodegradable materials which implies fewer possible impacts on the environment\".In order to evaluate those impacts, the positive and negatives ones, we met with Claudia Mac Lean, in charge of the Sustainability Office of the Faculty.That\u0092s why we joined an initiative launched by a professor from the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Fern\u00e1n Federici, aiming to gather people from different Chilean Universities and related to Synthetic Biology into a global organization which could be a Foundation or a NGO.We think one advantage of using macroalgae is that it could close the carbon cycle; it means macroalgae would consume environmental CO2 generated in the PLA production process, allowing global reduction of CO2.On the particular case of medical use, we think PLA should be used like suture, because sutures need to be degraded in a short time.Moreover, the degradation would have no nefast consequences on the organism as PLA is a biocompatible material.We infer PLA can be degraded into lactate, which could enter into the metabolic cycle of anaerobic bacteria, generating CH4 (methane) and/or CO2[2] .Students listening to the explanations of the teacher Alvaro Olivera, about Synthetic Biology.Considering the different projects of OpenBio-UChile, it appeared they would have more impact if they came from a wider organization than a Faculty Organized Group.Nevertheless, we discovered LCA in a late phase of the project, so we didn\u0092t have enough time to do this quantitative analysis because we should have looked for all the inputs and outputs of equivalent CO2 of feedstock and energy, for each stage of our process, which is a complex task.If we implemented our project in the long term we would promote cultivation of macroalgae which could contribute to economic development of Chile.We also talked with Andres Brice\u00f1o, co-founder of the Santiago Fab Lab, to make our project cross the frontier of the University and see if there was a real need or interest for biological PLA.This will be the first organization of that type in Chile which could centralize information about Synthetic Biology and constantly diffuse it through a Web platform in an open data way.She made us present our project to her pupils in the context of a Sustainable Project Workshop and she gave us some pieces of advice, like developping a Life Cycle Assessment analysis or asking us the functionality of our plastic; will it be used for every kind of plastic objects?So the idea of mixing PLA with a more \u0093esthetical\u0094 material such as wood allows a friendly design for many objects, which makes composite PLA a good candidate for new 3D-printed products.However we felt we were giving birth to something that could impact the Faculty, so the motivation to design the course is still intact.The teaching staff, iGEM team members and the students who came to learn more about Synthetic Biology together after the activity.Moreover, composite PLA can have better mechanical properties than PLA according to the material it is mixed with, and can last more than 2 years without losing its biodegradable properties, which allows a wider range of use.This would help forming responsible citizens.As this kind of activity was new for the high schools the team worked with, teachers helped with internal diffusion and they also invited other teachers and authorities of the institution.To make sure all these concepts had been understood, the team organized a game in which the pupils had to find the word corresponding to the projected pictures and some sweets were given to the winners!Environments without oxygen could be found in typical landfills, so in a hypothetical situation where PLA would be established in our society (it means PLA would have totally replaced plastic from fossil origin), huge amounts of PLA could worsen the global warming (due to greenhouse gases emissions)[3] .This initiative was born in March, 2015 and we met every month to define what would be the objective of the organization, its activities and the ways we could diffuse them.We think the trade off between replacing fossil plastics and avoiding an overproduction of PLA should need further analysis to evaluate the real impact of the PLA production process.When we presented our project, Andres Brice\u00f1o agreeded that although prices can vary a lot according to the country of origin, it is expensive to buy PLA.The team made an introduction to Synthetic Biology with an activity very similar to the workshop realized in high schools.Also, macroalgae don\u0092t require any farmland, fertilizer or fresh water and is a renewable resource, so it is a better alternative than corn cultivation (which is one of the main current production modes).On the contrary, for long life-time products such as pipes, chairs or big structures, it would be appropriate to keep using fossil plastics.Activation, inhibition and production were symbolized by green, red and white threads, respectively.Example of a representation of a genetic circuit: UV light enhances the production of lactate, which inhibits the repressor \u0093Inh\u0094 of the module responsible for the production of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).In the case of fossil plastic this wouldn\u0092t occur because current plastics are made of fossil combustible, which positively contributes to increase global CO2 amounts if they are partially degraded or combusted .On the other hand, the big problem of fossil plastic is its accumulation[5] .Moreover, the team organized an activity opened to the entire Faculty, in which the teacher could talk about the course and answer the questions pupils made.Moreover, pupils are the future professionals of the country, so it is necessary to broaden young minds introducing Synthetic Biology, how it works and its collaborative vision.Since the idea of our project had born talking with the Fab Lab of the University of Chile, as mentioned in the attritubution section (conception of the idea), we presented our project to the director of the Fab Lab, who wrote us a letter of inquiry.To do that, we used all the social networks we had and the institution diffusion channels, designing a poster and several short posts that showed the connection that synthetic biology has with Engineering.Twelve people came to the activity realized in the Faculty and 5 registered the course.As it was planned to open again the course this year, two members of the iGEM team decided to be part of the teaching staff, to re-design and improve the first version of the course, taking advantage of the experience gained with iGEM and including the open source philosophy.Also, the organization is composed of members from different universities and disciplines, where each one has diverse skills which can complement each other, allowing a faster share of information and technological development through collaboration.Conclusion: in the presence of UV light, GFP can be produced.The goal was to make the pupils collaboratively find solutions to the exposed problems, which difficulty grade increased as the workshop progressed.At the date, the organization is composed of members from three universities, the majority coming from the University of Chile since many students are part of OpenBio-UChile.", "modeling": "Nilsson, a Olofsson, M.

Zhang, R. W. Lenz, and S.

PLA production in a biological system using synthetic biology tools was formed.After the formation of the PLA project was elected by unanimity, we started to work in the design of the project and in the molecular biology needed to achieve a biological system controlled by a regulatory network that accomplished the principles of synthetic biology.Then the first conception was to enable a biological system that could handle a large production of recombinant proteins derived of a synthetic pathway, and that could be achieved using a controlled system based in the kinetic growth of the microorganism.Thus, a quorum sensing based expression system could handle the metabolic burden involved in a new pathway, and the production of PLA could be sustainable in time.One of the meetings of the recently formed iGEM group, in that time called just \u0093OpenBio\u0094, we met the Fab-LAB, a group that were interested in a new form of producing a raw material used for 3D printing, Polylactic Acid (PLA).PLA is actually produced by chemical synthesis using an old system called O\u0092Ring polymerization, so then a biological system should have comparable yields and low cost of purification process.We formed as an iGEM group in 2014, when we started to have recurrent meetings for creating new ideas of possible projects of synthetic biology, including some projects in the Centre of Bioengineering and Biotechnology.The significant costs associated to this process could be improved implementing a PLA export system that could be similar to a PHA phasins export systems reported.Until that we saw different ways of how to produce polymers of different kind in a biological system, comprehending the metabolic pathways known and searching for new genetic sources.In our first meeting we made several brainstorming considering two main objectives: to generate new ideas of projects and assess the feasibility in terms of experimental design.", "protocol": "", "result":

changes in cell shape, bad statistics (not measureing enough cells).First we find that the T7 promoter we used has no leakage and no detectable GFP is synthesised.Comparing the different fluorescence levels qualitatively the results are essentially consistent with those obtained using RFP though the quality (accuracy and precision) of the measurements is better for the TECAN microplate reader and the fluorimeter.To quantitatively compare the measurements with GFP expression and those previously obtained with RFP we have plotted one against the other for our 2 best protocols.The results from this protocol are shown below and show that there is a less good correlation than with the RFP measurements and those from the microplate reader and the fluorimeter.The instrument and its use are described in the methods and protocols section.The standard curve with the Dye shows there is a reasonable linear relationship between the measured fluorescence and the dye concentration (R\u00b2=0.96) though this is much less good than we obtained with the fluorimeter or the microplate reader suggesting the measurements are less accurate and reproducible.This curve shows, that under our measurement conditions the fluorimeter is about 100 times more sensitive than the microplate reader, as measured by the slope ; and 5 times more sensitive if we consider the concentration necessary to obtain twice the background measurement (0.5 vs 2.2 ng/ml).Below we show the results obtained for the different promoters measuring fluorescence from diluted cell suspensions.The instrument is also less sensitive than the other machines with a measurement of twice the background at 12.4 ng/ml.The measurements of cell suspensions shown here are less obviously consistent with the RFP measurements than obtained the machines used above.In view of the lower dispersion of the standard curve, and the greater sensitivity of the instrument we expect these results to be slightly better than those obtained using the microplate reader.The microplate reader and fluorimeter are commercial instruments designed to measure fluorescence in solution.These results are completely in agreement with those obtained using the microplate reader, and from the measurements of RFP.While the graph shows an approximately linear relationship it is imperfect, first the scatter suggests a small effect of the coding gene on the strength of the promoter, second the levelling of in the TECAN microplate measurements suggests an instrumentation problem (saturation of some sort) associated with our experimental conditions.We obtained fluorescence measurements with 4 different machines.We could then measure the strength of the promoter we used under standard conditions in a well characterized assay.Each promoter was integrated into a construction expressing GFP Bba_I13504 with a strong/weak RBS (BBa_B0034).We choose to use 4 different methods to study the strength of the different promoters:Each machine (if possible) was calibrated using a standard solution of the dye Atto488.However the results obtained with this simple and cheap device could probably be improved with a little more optimization.A microscope allows us to observe individual cells, this can give further information on the bacteria containing the different expression systems.Our T7 shows very low basal expression barely different from the negative control (477+/-4 vs 224+/-316 for the control) this means that in the absence of induction in the correct strain there is probably no leakage and the promoter does not work at all.The fluorimeter we used is much more sensitive than the microplate reader.We observe a small but significant difference in the slope of the standard curve depending on the buffer showing a slight reduction of fluorescence in LB buffer.The results obtained for the different promoters are shown here.First, as observed with the standard curve, a certain dispersion in the measurements probably arising from an imperfectly optimized protocol.As in the microplate reader, and can be seen in the figure, the standard curve with Atto488 is linear, with very little dispersion of the points.The microplate reader and fluorimeter appear to give the best and easiest to interpret results with the possibility of using a calibration curve to obtain absolute concentrations of GFP.This would need a standard GFP solution for the calibration measurements rather than Atto488.The Magicbox measurements were less accurate and precise.For the cell measurements samples were also 10 times more dilute.This allow us to compare the measurements on the different instruments.The Team AMU decided to study 5 different promoters from the collection in table 1 (J23117, J23106, J23118, J23101 and J23100) and compare also the T7 promoter Bba_K525998 that we used for some of our constructions (J23117, J23106, J23118, J23101 and J23100).In agreement with the previous measurements for RFP the J23100 promoter is the strongest and the J23117 the weakest of those in the promoter collection.Is the physiology of the bacteria seriously modified resulting in bacteria with a strange appearance.In the figure here we show some bacteria expressing GFP from the construction with the strong (1791AU in the table) J23101 promoter.So the samples used, both for the standard curve went only to 0.0175 ug/ml as opposed to 0.7 ug/ml for the microplate reader.", "safety": "", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite": "", "part_normal":

concentration cadmium ion, producing a red fluorescent protein RFP as well as CsgA-EC(s) to adsorb the ion.Based on the features described above, our project aim at assemble a device for removing cadmium by fusing CsgA and ECs to achieve absorbing Cd2+ extracellularly.Now we know, the cause of the disease is cadmium poisoning.About twelve million glasses were recalled in the United States.Figure 4 ?The paintcoat of the glasses sold by McDonald were detected to contain cadmium elements.In 2012?the report from the environmental organization of Canada about Potential Damage of Heavy Metals in Cosmetics said, almost all of the tested cosmetics contain toxic substances, including cadmium.In June 2012?Shandong Province, Rizhao City inspection and Quarantine Bureau seized 24 tons of heavy sauries from Japan , whose Cd content exceeded the safety standard.Figure 5?Rizhao(China) inspection and quarantine bureau staff at the time of sampling inspection, found that cadmium content of these 24tons saury exceeded the safety standard.Since there is no effective treatment of Itai Itai disease, and cadmium stored in the body did not rule out in a safe and effective method.Even mild cadmium poisoning can cause lung and kidney damage, like toxic pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonia.Asia is the world s largest primary cadmium metal producing areas, mainly in China, South Korea, and Japan.The river that local people used for drinking and irrigating crops was polluted by the sewage, containing a large amount of cadmium.But industry that is related to cadmium is globally existed?Smelting, spraying, welding and casting bearing surface of cadmium?Stope?Rods in nuclear reactors?Neutron absorber?Electroplating factory, and so on.In June 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission confirmed that the glasses sold by McDonald were found to contain cadmium elements in the paintcoat, which could exude from the surface of the glasses.When our E.coli is in a certain condition of low cadmium ion concentration, only the green chromoprotein cjBlue will be expressed, leading to a color of dark green in culture.We employ E.coli superficial fiber curli protein\u0097CsgA and synthetic phytochelatins (ECs) to form CsgA-ECs, which can effectively remove cadmium ion in wastewater.Up to now, in 2014, a village in Guangxi, China also has the occurrence of Itai-Itai disease.Figure 2: A child was moaning because the great pain caused by Itai-Itai disease.Cadmium\u0092s entering human body can make it a huge loss of calcium in bones and trigger a series of damage, like osteoporosis, bone atrophy, joint pain and so on.", "description": "", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "Another great pity is that crippled by our poor measuring apparatus, we merely did some preliminary data measurement and treatment.Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the color change and the capacity of cadmium adsorption of the whole system in different initial concentration of extracellular cadmium ion.Based on the strength of these two promotors, we built a mathematical model to predict the capacity of processing the cadmium ion.The core of Bio-effector is csgA-EC compound.We also built a model about that based on their chelating equilibrium constant and use it to do the same thing as last model we have talked about.However, not everything went well, because of the lack of time, we failed to knock out the gene of csgA of wild type on time, we could only gain our referential parameters from multitudinous literatures and establish a similar model.This kind of method leads a result that when the concentration of cadmium ion is below the low limit of detection, the system is blue, otherwise it\u0092s red instead.We believe, by doing so, we may conform better to the meaning of synthetic biology.As was discussed before, there are two devices of our system, one was named bio-sensor and the other, of course, was named bio-effector.And here we will just briefly talk about them.The former also has two main parts: PcadA, which is the cadmium ion induced promotor; and Ptet, which is simply Tetracycline induced promoter.The whole system was the divided into two devices.In order to simulate how it worked and made it simple for us to evaluate the result, we strive vigorously to establish a precise mathematical model of the procedure.CsgA-EC, whose function is decreasing the concentration of cadmium ion by using chelation, is the unit of our E.coli\u0092s curli.", "notebook": "Having finished this part ,we had time to give assistance to our partner , cooperation makes our team more united ,and we gained a lot of joy at the same time.Without the Cd2+ existence , Ptet didn\u0092t resist the expression of cjblue ,and we can see blue fluorescence in bacterial colony.In this way we can distinguish the expression difference of E.coli under the condition of Cd2+ existence or not.Contents: Obtained Ptet and cjblue through PCR techniques,we digested Ptet and cjblue,they were assembled in plasmid pSB1c3.Notes: We found some problems at the beginning,we can\u0092t get the Ptet due to the false we made in primer designing,we re-designed the primer and got the right gene successfully.Besides, during the recovery of PCR product,No plastic recycling caused empty PSB1C3,later then we change the way of recycling,this trouble was dealt smoothly.Conclusion: Moloecular construction of this part was relatively simple as last part.Although we met some problems ,we corrected them in time to make our plan developed,which was worth for us to feel happy,and it made us believe in ourselves that we could finish the project perfectly at the same time.Introduction: We built the pathway for Cd2+ ion to enter into the E.coli ,we had constructed parts as follow: Contents: PCR techniques, transformation of plasmid,constructed PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 on PSB1C3.2.Assembled PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 to the pSB1C3 with pSB1C3 on it.Note:we had some trouble on the way to get PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 through PCR techniques, we can not obtain target gene from plasmid by PCR directly because these promoter were too short, so we adopted overlap PCR to get them.Later then,we successfully constructed :Conclusion: we managed this part of moloecular construction smoothly without too much problems,which made our experiment in an orderly manner.With the PcadA designed on the primer,we successfully constructed PcadA on CsgA-EC?0?1?2?3?5? The PcadA-CsgA-EC(0?1?2?3?5?were digested by restriction enzyme ,then they were loaded on the pSB1c3 which contain the gene of tetR-RFP-ter.During this part we met many kinds of problems so that we had spent many time but we can not improve the efficiency,which meant we had to reflect ourselves.During the month,we were trying to find out the reason why CsgA can\u0092t fit PcadA successfully.We checked the correctness of gene,even we restarted from the first step,we gained nothing.As shown in figure, the protein MerR can repress PcadA with Cd2+ absence, which makes downstream gene TetRcan\u0092t express so that it can\u0092t repress Ptet.We started to do the PCR in order to get our targeted gene PcadA and CsgA-EC?we got the CsgA?EC0?from company?so EC would be link with CsgA during the PCR procession?EC?2?3?5?had to adopt two-round PCR due to their length.We got the Top10 strain to prepared for our experiment and we used restriction enzyme to digest single gene (tetR?RFP)on pSB1c3,and made a ligation with terminator.This year our project aims to dealing with heavy metal ion--Cd2+,considering about the amount of work, we divided our project into two parts: intracellular Cd2+concentration sensing signal circuit structure and extracellular surface adsorption.We obtained PcadA and CsgA ,we tried to link them,however,we found no colony on culture medium.At the same time, cjblue stop expressing with tetR\u0092s expression so thatE.coli becomes red gradually.Up to now,all moloecular construction had been finished.We successfully constructed  Having finished moloecular construction we sped up composing our wiki,On the other hand we started to prepare posters and the presentation at the same time and detected parameters by modeling group to perfect our project.We repeated the transformation but found that the colony we transformed last week turned blue,which meant false positive colony grows faster than target colony.After we finished transformation and inoculated ,we sent our plasmids for sequencing,however ,nothing was found on pSB1c3.", "protocol": "Until the front of the dye into the separating gel, boost the voltage to 150V,

environment?Because the Cd2+ solution can only be absorbed rather than be broken down, if the genetic microorganism which have absorbed Cd2+ are not recycled,it will release Cd2+ to natural environment sooner or later.First of all, we tend to add a adhesion molecule mechanism which is controlled by PCadA to make it easier to get down in the bottom of the water as the microorganism begin to absorb Cd2+.So the Secondly, we add auxotrophic genes in the relevant auxotrophic bacteria which are controlled by PCadA so that the genetic microorganisms can live in our polluted water rather than natural environment.In order to keep the cadmium ion pollution under control, we add the phosphate buffer to the cadmium ion solution to form precipitation.Then, we would send the cadmium ion precipitation to the environment agency of SCUT.We have come up with 2 possible ways to solve it.Firstly ,we don\u0092t use any pathogenic microorganism ,secondly ,we use gloves and mask when necessary ,thirdly, all the vectors and genetic microorganism and Cd2+ solution won\u0092t be abandoned directly into environment unless they are treated properly.At the same time ,the genetic

PCR amplification of another leading to a new, chimeric 16S gene that is not indicative of any bacterial or archaeal species.These reads must be removed to make sure that our data are accurate.Third: we aim to construct a metagenomic library of the microbial DNA found in the porcupine microbiome as a way to isolate and characterize genes for useful cellulose degrading enzymes that can be expressed in E. coli.DNA provides better taxonomic identification than traditional bacteriological assays like Gram stains.It is conserved only in prokaryotes, thus excluding eukaryotes from our identification proceduresIt is a short sequence, which makes it ideal for cheap Sanger DNA equencing and for high-throughput technologies like those used in the Microbiome Survey sectionThe 16S rRNA gene contains nine variable regions, some of which are flanked with constant regions that can be used to amplify smaller fragments that contain the variable regions.This part of our project is designed to determine if a metagenomic library constructed from the DNA extracted from gut microbiomes is indeed useful for biological engineering: in our investigation, we are specifically seeking genes that encode enzymes capable of degrading softwood lumber waste and turning it into useful compounds like bio-plastics and bio-fuels.PICRUSt can then output a predicted metagenome for each 16S sequence picked in the closed OTU picking step and provide inferred gene content for the entire microbiome.The fecal samples contained ton s of bacteria, and we wanted a quick and easy way to ensure there were some cellulose degrading bacteria.We are left with clean, pure genomic DNA from all the cells in the fecal sample.To prepare our genomic DNA sample for illumina sequencing, we first had to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to create many copies of a specific region of the genomes.The taxonomic assignment occurs in 7 steps, which are all wrapped by the pick_denovo_otus script provided by QIIME:Pick OTUs based on sequence similarity within the reads (de-novo picking)Each step here gets us to the OTU table, which can be used for downstream analysis including chart creation and PICRUSt analysis.Lastly we remove low confidence OTUs that are represented by less than 0.1% of the sequencing reads.We must use the QIIME tools to clean up the raw data and retain what is useful.The first step is to align forward and reverse DNA sequence reads, which come out of the sequencer as single-strand reads, and compile them into double-stranded reads.We invite you to check out our entire process and walk with us as we explore the vast possibilities of cellulose degraders, microbiomes and biofuel production.The function of this microbiome survey is to get a handle on what kinds of organisms are present in mammal microbiomes to see if the use of microbiomes as a \"mine\" for biological engineering purposes is feasible.For 16S sequencing using high-throughput assays, it generally requires a smaller piece of DNA, so these constant regions can be useful when the input size is smaller than the entire gene.When we first begun our project we had every intention of constructing a metagenomic library using the porcupine fecal sample as our environmental isolate.This gene is used widely as a molecular phylogeny taxonomic identifier: analysis of the obtained data will provide us with a good idea of what bacteria are present in each sample.The microbiome helper tool, developed by Dr. Morgan Langille, contains the entire Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, pronounced \u0093chime\u0094) set of tools which, collectively, are an open-source pipeline that wraps many other tools necessary for the analysis of illumina sequenced 16S rRNA gene data.The incorporation of the vector into a model organism provides that organism with selectable growth advantage, which can help to identify organisms containing the vector.Introduction of vector (and foreign environmental DNA) into a model organism.The DNA extraction step allows us to identify these bacteria through the bacterial DNA found in each fecal sample.Through the use of 16S taxonomy data and through PICRUSt analysis we intend to show that these microbiomes are a gold mine for biological engineering.The wildlife park has been an invaluable resource.Using PCR we amplified all of the 16S regions found in our fecal sample DNA extractions When the PCR-amplified DNA is placed into the flow cell, the adapter region added by PCR binds to complementary oligonucleotides attached to the surface of the flow cell.The resulting sequences were used to identify the bacterial colonies to the Genus level.The 16S rRNA gene, as mentioned in the Microbiome Survey section and here in Isolation, is a perfect gene for taxonomy identification in bacteria.This number is chosen because it is the predicted sample bleed-through on the illumina MiSeq machine, making it a cutoff for removal of low confidence OTUs.Using QIIME we can then create alpha- and beta-diversity charts for the samples, and pie/bar charts for taxonomy for each phylogenetic group (class, family, genus, etc).A chimeric read is a piece of DNA amplified during the PCR step that is a combination of two separate molecules that became joined as a byproduct of PCR.For illumina sequencing, the oligonucleotide primers also contain an adapter region that is added onto the terminus of the amplified 16S rRNA gene DNA, allowing the DNA to be compatible with DNA linked to the illumina sequencer flowcell.To be used in further downstream processes, the large environmental DNA pieces were cut by restriction enzymes which act at specific sites called restriction sitesIncorporation into a vector.This pipeline makes it possible to analyze 16S data efficiently and with accuracy to determine the taxonomy of the microbial community represented by the 16S sequences.contain not only sequences that are important to us, but also chimeric sequences, bad quality sequences, very short sequences and lots of other \u0093junk data\u0094 that could interfere with our taxonomic assessment down the pipeline.For this task we use QIIME analysis tools with the help of the Integrated Microbiome Resource here at Dalhousie University and Dr. Morgan Langille\u0092s Microbiome Helper tool.To fully understand the data that the illumina sequencer gives us, we must use a data analysis pipeline.This was done as a quick and dirty identification of some of the cellulose degrading bacteria as a starting place for our project.These oligonucleotides anneal to a template and provide a free 5\u0092-OH group, essentially priming the DNA synthesis reaction; the heat-stable polymerase then amplifies DNA from that template strand.The chemical analysis part of our project allowed us to ensure that using E. coli in the softwood lumber industry would be feasible.A pipeline is simply a set of tools used in the workflow of data analysis to provide us with a clear picture of the data we have collected.This is what we are aiming to do with this year s project.Our project will characterize the microbiomes from the North American Porcupines found in Nova Scotia forests and attempt to \"mine\" the microbiome for useful enzymes.The adapter addition is important because it introduces specificity in that only DNA containing the adapter will be sequenced.The environmental DNA extraction provides us with DNA from the organisms in the microbiomes of each of the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park mammals.Thus, the gut microbiome of the North American porcupine seems like a logical starting point for our search of a microbiome to mine.Our project is designed in three stages.Analysis of the genomic DNA mixture provides us with biological information such as the identities of the organisms present and the major functions of the microbiomes.In the case of PICRUSt, the OTU picking is done against the GreenGene database, and that database is then used to predict gene familes from the metagenomes associated with that database.The PICRUSt algorithm works in two steps.The sequence information can then be used to determine what bacteria are found in the sample.Illumina sequencing provides a massive amount of data that must then be sifted through with the aid of computer programs.Examples of these can be seen below, and these charts from our fecal sample analysis can be found here After taxonomic assignment, a tool called Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was used to determine functionality of OTU\u0092s within the microbiome of each animal.Because this is a particularly daunting task for even a strong computer, this step is only done once and the output is provided for the next step.This metagenome inference is done by comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequence to known sequences and makes conclusions on the identity of each sequence\u0092s evolutionary relative.The terpenes often found in pine tree resin are known to exhibit anti-microbial properties -- this could be an issue if we try to utilize bacteria to break down softwood lumber, for example.The terpenes in pine tree resin have high boiling points (150C - 200C), and simply distilling them would cause decomposition of the terpenes into other compounds.After many cycles, we have exponential amplification of the segment of DNA that is flanked by the oligonucleotide primers.After collecting the distillate from this procedure (which is actually a mixture of clear water with a thin film of terpenic extract floating on top), the organic layer is extracted out and used for analysis!Abubucker, S., Segata, N., Goll J., Schubert, A. M., Izard, J., Cantarel, B. L., et al.Alkaline lysis works through a detergent, which disrupts the membranes of the bacterial cells.A discrete portion of the 16S rRNA gene from each of the three microbes was amplified using pcr.Although we didn\u0092t get too far with the library, we did make some changes to the protocol to make the construction procedure more efficient.We were originally interested in developing the metagenomic library as it would provide the ability to assess and exploit the whole microbial genomic composition found in our environmental sample.If half of the sequence matches a region from one genome, while the second half of the sequence matches a region from the genome of a different organism, the program knows that the sequence is chimeric and not a biologically distinct sequence.Next, the non-chimeric, paired and filtered reads are matched against a database.QIIME uses PEAR (Paired-End reAd mergeR) to do this.The next step is to use a statistics tool called fastQC, which provides us with information of the read quality and length from the paired reads created in the PEAR step.*; Caporaso, J. G.; McDonald, D.; Knights, D.; a Reyes, J.; Clemente, J. C.; Burkepile, D. E.; Vega Thurber, R. L.; Knight, R.; Beiko, R. G.; and Huttenhower, C. Predictive functional profiling of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences.PICRUSt infers the gene content of the organisms present in the OTU picking output by comparing them to their sequenced evolutionary relatives.Each colony that grows can be used to study a specific fragment of DNA from the environmental sample.Examination of the DNA in the metagenomic library.The DNA inserted into the model organism will contain genes which will code for enzymes.These fecal samples contain millions of each animal\u0092s gut microbes, which make up the microbiomes of their gut.First: we hope to isolate and characterize the microbiomes of many animals found at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park.We used chloroform extraction to isolate large pieces of DNA from the porcupine fecal sample.Manipulation of the DNA.Because the 16S region of the bacterial and archaeal genomes are conserved, they often contain some level of sequence similarity.Terpenes are insoluble in water, and a mixture of the two (with far more water than terpenes) will boil at a temperature slightly lower than 100C.Through de-novo OTU picking, the program does not throw out 16S data.This is problematic because we d be left with the following question: are we testing the inhibition of pine tree resin terpenes, or the products of terpene decomposition?Although we DID use conventional distillation and obtained a terpenic extract, we also applied a \"softer\" distillation method to avoid potential decomposition.The specific region we require for microbial identification is the 16S rRNA gene.A microbiome is the collection of microbes found in and on larger organisms.Because they eat a supplemented diet, and diet does affect microbiome content, there is potential error associated with the use of samples obtained from the Park.We did not get to the metagenomic library this year, but a quick description of it is given here.Cellulose-degrading bacteria were isolated on cellulose medium (see protocol page for medium recipe) which contained ground Whatman paper acting as the cellulose source.That being said, we did begin the construction of the library with the help from the Waterloo iGEM team who provided the pJC8 cosmid, to be used as the vector for our library construction.Metagenomics can provide insight into enzymatic pathways, evolutionary profiles, and microbial function.Metagenomics provides the chance to search through the incredible biodiversity found in the environment without having to conform the sample to fit within standard laboratory techniques.The Park was also the safest way for us to obtain fecal samples, so associated error was acknowledged as part of this process.We obtained fecal samples from 21 mammals at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park.Shubenacadie Wildlife Park Microbiome Survey | Metagenomic Library and Isolation | Chemical AnalysisCellulolytic enzymes have become a very interesting field of research for the potential production of microbial biofuels.This step is extended to organisms that are part of the living relatives group, but are still unknown because they have not been studied.The bound PCR products are sequenced through the addition of fluorescently labelled deoxy-ribonucleotides that glow when they are incorporated into the DNA molecule.It is more inclusive because any 16S sequence not matched to a reference database in open and closed OTU picking are thrown out.Our chemical analysis section allowed us to look into this and ensure we won t have any more problems down the road.Bacteria have already established their role in industry, and their applicability in the industrial sector has been growing rapidly.After receiving fecal samples from Shubenacadie Wildlife Park, the team plated the samples on the cellulose medium.The annealing step allows the oligonucleotide primers to bind to the single-stranded molecules at their complementary sequence.The database matching step picks operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are represented by distinct 16S gene sequences, and compares them to a database to be taxonomically identified.Otherwise, matches will not correspond to the precomputed reference database and PICRUSt will be unable to complete the second step.The second step is metagenome inference.This allows for the insertion of DNA into the cell followed by its maintenance and the stable production of plasmid-encoded proteins.These colonies were then streak purified on LB medium.We managed to isolate bacteria capable of growing on the cellulose medium.The transformed cells are then grown on selective medium and only cells that contain the vector will survive and form colonies (because of the antibiotic resistance segment in the vector).However, we considered this error to be minimized as the mammals eat many of the same things they would in nature.For the initial round of porcupine fecal samples, we made duplicates of every plate so that we could incubate in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.This happens hundreds of thousands of times in a massively parallel process to sequence all of the amplified DNA from our PCR amplification step.De-novo OTU picking matches 16S sequences together into OTUs without the use of any reference database; Open OTU picking matches 16S sequences to an open-sourced database like BLAST; and Closed OTU picking matches 16S sequences to a closed database like GreenGenes.fastQC also has scripts for this process.Following filtering of the reads, chimeric reads must be removed.Producing biofuel from things like leftover vegetables, lumber industry by-products and waste, seaweed and other easily obtainable sources could provide an answer to the ever-growing problem of energy production.The Softwood Lumber industry is particularly pertinent for Nova Scotia.The softwood lumber industry in Nova Scotia also harvested roughly 29,000 hectares of forest for the creation of softwood products.The vector is often introduced into the model organism, Escherichia coli, through a process called transformation.It is important that the sample collected represents the entirety of the environment being examined.It can then use the host cell macromolecular synthesis machinery to produce proteins encoded by the foreign genetic material.Interestingly, the North American Porcupine eats mostly bark and wood from trees found in Nova Scotia.This is why OTU picking from QIIME taxonomy assignments must be done to a closed reference database.Metagenomics, in comparison to phytogenic surveys, does more than look at the diversity of one gene (ex.Arctic Ocean Microbial Community Structure before and after the 2007 Record Sea Ice Minimum.HUMAnN: The HMP unified metabolic analysis network.Imagine taking these useless by-products and turning them into a sustainable form of energy like an ethanol biofuel through a simple biological reactor using E. coli and enzymes harvested from cellulose-degrading bacteria.The research in this area is new, but we are learning more and more of the importance of a healthy gut microbiome.The animals are fed a supplemented diet, which consists mainly of natural diets with added food like fruits/veggies for the herbivores and protein supplements for the carnivores.Mechanical lysis works through small ceramic beads shaken in the tube at high speeds to mechanically break up bacterial membranes and release the bacterial cell contents.The metagenomic library is our future goal for this project, which will enable us to screen for useful enzymes in biofuel production from our fecal sample bacteria.PCR works by using small oligonucleotides that are called primers, and a heat-stable DNA polymerase.The method we used is de-novo OTU picking, which does not use a reference database for OTU picking, and then compares the OTU\u0092s to a database for identification.However, as other areas of the research began to erupt in exciting results, the library got put on the back burner.The broken bacterial cell debris is discarded and a supernate is passed through a column, where DNA binds but all other cell material flows through.To get access to this sequence information we used Illumina MiSeq.The illumina sequencer works on a principle called sequence-by-synthesis.A vector is a DNA molecule that can carry foreign genetic material into another cell.Our work is definitely inspired with this in mind, but if we want to generate a strain that operates anywhere near pine tree resin, there is a caveat which must first be investigated.Pine tree resin contains (amongst many other things) a mixture of terpenes.The PICRUSt algorithm therefore precomputes the gene content of all known organisms in a reference database.The medium was used by a research group in India who were conducting very similar experiments, and they had had great success in isolating cellulose-degrading bacteria.This is done by estimating the unknown living relatives  gene content through their 16S sequence similarity to studied and sequenced organisms.PICRUSt works by predicting the gene families contained inside a bacterial or archaeal metagenome identified using 16S bacteria or archaeal sequencing.The illumina sequencer records each of these flashes of coloured light and is able to interpret this information to provide a DNA sequence.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We also built a Microbiome Map of Shubenacadie Wildlife Park, which took sequencing results from our project and incorporated them into an interactive tool to learn a bit more about microbiomes.This year we tried to have a few different focuses for our Human Practices, including an integrated project.We also reached out to the Advanced Education Minister of Nova Scotia in an effort to make iGEM a more sustainable effort for Atlantic Canadian University.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Bacterial Isolation, Metagenomic Library, and Terpene Experiments", "protocol": "", "result": "Next year we intend to move forward with the metagenomic library and isolate more enzymes that would be useful for converting soft-wood lumber waste to a source of efficient fuel (ethanol) or be useful for bioremediation.Using the cellulose media, we plated porcupine fecal samples to inspect which species could be cultivated and would degrade cellulose.It can be seen in figure 3 that the transketolase enzyme and the starch phosphorylase enzyme are found with higher proportion in the arctic wolf and coyote samples than in the beaver and porcupine samples.This information provides some evidence that our future metagenomic library will be a fruitful endeavour.It can be noticed that the beaver and porcupine microbiomes have significantly higher proportions of these cellulose degrading enzymes than the arctic wolf or coyote microbiomes.We also did a second analysis looking at enzymes found at a higher proportion in the arctic wolf and coyote.For bioremediation, however, a different species of bacteria should be used to screen the metagenomic library (because E. coli can survive terpenes).All of the above results, for both E. coli and S. cerevisiae are summarized in Figure 4 below.This year we had a bit of time to perfect the metagenomic library protocol.We were able to grow many colonies on the cellulose media plates, showing us that there are many cellulose bacteria in the porcupine gut.The colony PCR that was done with the cellulose-degrading colonies can be seen on the gel to the left.They came from the porcupine fecal sample, on two separate cellulose plates grown aerobically at 37 degrees celcius.Other colony PCR experiments were done on three different colony morphologies found on the porcupine fecal sample cellulose plate: white colonies, yellow colonies and red bulls-eye colonies.Making a beaver microbiome metagenomic library should yield plenty of useful cellulose-degrading enzymes.We found that the commercial stuff contained mostly D-Limonene, as well as a variety of other terpenes (with alpha-pinene being present in very trace amounts).We also created a couple of new biobricks containing enzymes that we identified bioinformatically from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, a cellulose degrader identified in the porcupine microbiome.A series of culturing tubes were innoculated with E. coli and varying amounts of the terpenic extract were added; we started at a concentration of 4.3 mg/mL and worked our way down, and then measured turbidity -- and found no inhibition.We should be able to screen this library for cellulose degrading enzymes as well as terpene degrading enzymes that could prove useful in our search for new biofuel feedstocks and production solutionsWe have been able to provide evidence that a metagenomic library from DNA extracted from porcupine fecal samples would provide us with a new source of cellulose degrading enzymes.We therefore conclude that E. coli is very resistant to the anti-microbial properties of pine tree resin, and that the terpenes would not interfere with our goals for cellulose degradation.In comparison, the terpenic extract contained mostly alpha-pinene and beta-pinene in a 3:1 ratio.We tested for bacterial inhibition first by simply culturing E. coli on solid media with a dab of pine tree resin in the center.We showed that growth of an E. coli strain used to degrade soft-wood lumber waste would not be inhibited by the anti-microbial properties of terpenes found in trees milled for softwood lumber.We expected we would find a zone of inhibition, but did not observe such a thing.After isolating the terpenic extract from the resin, we repeated similar experiments by soaking into Whatman filter paper and placing it in the culturing plate.This can be seen in B of figure 1 below.We did a PICRUSt analysis on this 16S data from 4 animals in the park whose microbiomes we re-sequenced.The next step would be to actually attempt the metagenomic library and search for the enzymes we have been able to identify bioinformatically.With the brown streak pattern and the lactose fermenting we labelled this bacterium as likely a Sphingomonas sp.The high-throughput sequencing part of our project was done mostly to provide evidence for the feasibility of creating a metagenomic library from microbiome DNA.With this new protocol we believe that we will be able to build the metagenomic library using DNA Extracted from porcupine fecal sample and transforming that library into E. coli.We also did an extensive proof of concept for our plan to use microbiomes as a \"mine\" for enzymes and gathered evidence that it would, likely, enable us to identify genes that encode cellulose degrading enzymes.After 16S sequencing the yellow colony was identified as Escherichia coli and the red bulls-eye colony was identified as Stenotrophomonas rhizophila.These resequenced samples included the beaver, the porcupine, the arctic wolf and the coyote.The results are documented in detail on our Proof of Concept page.We were able to sequence the microbiomes of 21 mammals from the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park with the help of the Integrated Microbiome Resource at Dalhousie University.We found that the microbiomes of animals that are of similar families, or are closely related evolutionarily, correlate with the similarity of their microbiomes.The sequencing of the white colony morphology proved challenging.", "safety": "Because of this, we had many resources for maintaining our health and safety such as Dalhousie\u0092s

the handbook turned to focus on pathogenesis, transmission, and prevention measures of mosquito-borne diseases; besides, we adapted the procedures of treatment to affected parts into cartoon, so that the public can read and understand it easily.Through the revising and communication on the handbook, we deepened our understanding that prevention and treatment of mosquito-borne diseases can not be achieved by a small group of people in a few days; it is a long journey, a huge project that involves whole human beings.As the people also living in mosquito-borne diseases endemic area, we hope we can do something for the people in African continent thousands miles away.After we finished the English handbook, we managed to get in touch with the Chinese educator in Zambia on social network, explained our project to him and showed our willing to cooperate.We decide to explore the way to alleviating mosquito-borne diseases transmission from the point of science and education and to set it as the main part of HUMAN PRACTICE program.May 2016, we distributed questionnaires about mosquito-borne diseases in China at first.6.Interview in Fujian Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0August 31st, in order to ensure the academic rigor of the handbook, we went to Fujian Center for Disease Control and Prevention and invited mosquito-borne diseases expert, Haibao Xu, to revise the content.In the first edition of the handbook, we compiled the collected literature and arranged relevant knowledge on mosquito species, distribution areas, disease transmission, protection against mosquito, and rumor clarification.The iGEM and the synthetic biology are known by the public gradually.In order to let more people to know us as well as getting in touch with us, we optimized our platform on WeChat and Sina Microblog.We could not predict the result of it, but we were looking forward to it.Receiving the response that they were glad to cooperate with us, the whole team was so inspiring: carrying our dream and hope, the handbooks finally could travel across oceans to a wonderful land where we could not reach to.We expressed that we wanted to send our English handbooks to the educational institution where he was working and hoped he can help us to distribute these handbooks to the people there.At the beginning of July, we completed the first edition of the handbook.Being inspired, we came back to our lab and carried out the second edition of handbook immediately.From the statistics and analysis of the result, we found many people did not know basic mosquitoes  knowledge, such as mosquito species, mosquito distribution area.Meanwhile, it is a though public health problem.\u0094 With the deepening of the experimental process and the increase of reading volumes, we firmly believe what WHO reported.In the half a day, we have obtained too much, and more importantly, we recognized the core of human practice program, which is enthusiasm.In the class, we talked about the development of Synthetic Biology, basics for Bioinformatics, methods in Molecular Biology and so on.We presented useful information in a more concise and clearer way, focused on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases and deleted mosquito eradication methods that can not be applied locally.We offered the service of answering the questions on the iGEM and the synthetic biology from our school\u0092s students and sent the news of the Frontier Science Program sometimes.The followers of our platform can acquire a lot of useful information about the synthetic biology and iGEM from us.During the winter holiday at the beginning of 2016, our team held several times public lectures in our school.Watching at the photos and short videos from Zambia in the e-mail, our hearts were full of appreciation.We affirmed our belief: insignificant as we are, we should never give up any chances which may make differences; we should keep striving to make a better and brighter future for the world.At here, we grasped a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of health education and working procedures, learned the enthusiasm for health education career, and gained the methods of health education as well as guiding concept.With the curiosity of those questions, we waited for the response restlessly.About a week later, we received the e-mail from Zambia.How can we convey our common expectations to the people in other countries?Our answer is to make an English version of the handbook.October 2015, our team held the info session at the College of Plant Protection and the College of Life Sciences in our school to share the information on the synthetic biology with lots of students under the help of school.When Zika virus becomes the focal point of the world, malaria, the mosquito-borne diseases which have tortured human beings for hundreds of years, is still alive, even though we have already developed and promoted antimalarial drugs like Artemisinin.As the first team joined the iGEM in Fuzhou, the reports of our team\u0092s story not only encourage the students in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, but also motivate many students in other schools.The aim of the public lectures is to improve students\u0092 interests on the biology.This result led to the idea of producing a handbook about protection against mosquitoes, which covers basic knowledge of mosquito-borne diseases and demonstrates a certain amount of frontier anti-mosquitoes technology.All the students in our school can come to have these lectures for free.With these efforts, more and more students learn about the synthetic biology, and most of them would like to take part in the iGEM competition.Except that, we made survey about mosquitoes among public, visiting Center for Disease Control, interview experts in the related filed.We will introduce our Human Practice project in the timeline.From October to November, our team accepted the interview both from the newspaper and the school radio station.Although there are still some problems, it is already a great leap compared to the first one.Our second edition gained recognition in the promotion.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Before the first week, we cultivated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.We sent our reserved parts to SYSU-CHINA team and ShanghaiTechChina_B team to help them to finish project.We distributed questionnaires about mosquito-borne diseases in China.We designed primers for \u00a0Cry4a,Cry10a, Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2,EGFP genes.The greens in the figure are positive for transformation.We designed the qPCR primers use of detection Cry4a,Cry10a,Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2 genes expression.The genes from Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis strain BRC-LLP29Molecular cloning of Cry4a,Cry4b,Cry10a, Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2,EGFP genes.Vector is pChlamy-3.Analysis of Negative Result?\u00a0Annealing reaction was not set.", "protocol": "Transfer the upper colourless aqueousphase into a new 1.5ml EP tube(RNase-Free).6.Add 250?l isopropanol, turn the tube upside down many times for around10 min, and let it sit at room temperature for 10 min until the white flocculearise,and then centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4?.7.Discard the supernatant,add 500?l,75%ethanol with DEPC,and mixthoroughly.Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4? and discard the supernatant.8.Dry it at room temperature or in the bechtop for 15 min.9.Add 15-20?l RNase-Free water to dissolve RNA when the precipitate becometransparent.Attention: All team members just can feeding the larvae of mosquitoes.While the transformation mixtures are incubating, add 5 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature into each well of a 6-well plate.Note: You will divide each transformation mixture between two wells of a 6-well plate after electroporation, so that the cells in each transformation mixture will recover in 10 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution total.9.Vortex vigorously for 10 second.Note: presence of small amount of unlysed cells would not affect the quality of the samples.Add appropriate amounts of buffer B (1/10 of buffer A) to the lysate and vortex vigorously for 10 seconds.Transfer/pour the cell lysate to pre-chilled filter cartridge, and centrifuge in a microcentrifuge at 14,000-16,000 rpm for 30 seconds.The clear cell lysate in collection tube is ready to use.Split the transformation mixture into two aliquots of 125 ?L each and transfer each aliquot into one well of the 6-well plate containing 5 mL/well of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature.(~30 mins)The larvae are fed every day with food C.

collector with bacteria attached to it on its functionality.For the first time in history, the global demand for fresh water is overtaking its supply in many parts of the world.Having access to clean water is a fundamental human right.", "design": "As we can print our 3D shape in many different sizes, bottles of all sizes and shapes can be used as a water reservoir.As the biological function of the device can deteriorate over time, you will have to renew your dewpal from time to time, meaning we are still creating plastic waste.Overall, dewpal is comparable to the fog catchers in Peru, however, thanks to the INP that is attached via synthetic biology approaches, the atmospheric water capturing capabilities are expected to be higher when the dewpal collectors can be printed on full scale.The main reason that our dewpal is better than Watergen is because it needs no electricity.There is Watergen, a company that describes its vision as follows: \u0093Water-gen\u0092s vision is to provide humanity with an abundant, renewable source of fresh, clean drinking water, by extracting it directly from the air, our most abundant water resource.\u0094 The products they develop, however, need electricity, which is not always and everywhere available in Third World Countries.A comparison in the quantity of water the dewpal water collector catches and price still need to be made.Also, as you can see in following simulation, the shape can be screwed on all sorts of water bottles so that the water can immediately be collected.Our project wants to design an optimized modular shape/surface for condensation and subsequent freshwater collection by gravity to solve the fact that in 2025, more than half of the countries in the world will be experiencing water shortage.Our dewpal device consists of a 3D printed shape with a screwcap so it can be attached to water bottles.This means that apart from the catchers, water tanks still need to be installed to provide the community with water in the months where no fog is formed.The U.N. predicts that by 2025, more than half of the countries in the world will be experiencing water stress or outright shortages.The biological functional half sphere of your dewpal can be disconnected from your screwcap bottom, meaning the screwcap bottom could have a nearly endless life time, while only the biologically functional part would need replacement from time to time.We tweaked this design so the air can enter our shape (see picture below), meaning we can collect more water than just the basic  full sphere  structure as it has a larger active surface area.As we already have the bacteria with INP attached, these only need to be cultured, which also shouldn t be too big of a cost.As for the water collection, we see our dewpal competing with the other projects once we get to full printing size.There is also need for piping to guide the water from the catchers to the water tanks.A pump is attached for easy access to the water.By building 5 fog catchers and planting over 1000 trees they were able to use water that was otherwise not used (from the fog), instead of water from the dwindling aquifers in Lima.A downside of the fogcatchers is that the presence of fog is an absolute must for the devices to collect water.This turbine directs air into the underground condensation chamber, where water is collected.Note that this design isn t implemented yet by our shape group, but will be in the future.The planted trees, by self-irrigating, help the restoration of the natural water cycle in the region.A major downside to the WaterSeer project is that a hole of two meters needs to be dug out to install the device.The former United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, states the  Lack of access to water for drinking, hygiene and food security inflicts enormous hardship on more than one billion members of the human family .As our project is developed for use in areas where water is scarce and these areas often coincide with developing and third world countries, electricity will not be freely available at any time.By doing this, our device has a positive impact on reducing plastic waste, as empty plastic bottles can now be used as a water reservoir, prolonging their life as such.It consists of a device that is planted at two meter under the ground, with a wind turbine head that sits above the ground.As millions of people are living in areas with water scarcity, our device could impact the life of all of them.Having access to fresh water is a fundamental human right.Being able to functionalize 3D printed shapes with biologicals has an ambundance of potential applications.There are already some potential solutions to water scarcity based on atmospheric water generation:There are fog catchers in Lima, Peru.No piping is needed as gravity makes the water flow through a series of collectors to a plastic bottle acting as a water reservoir.", "human_practice": "As we can print our 3D shape in many different sizes, bottles of all sizes and shapes can be used as a water reservoir.As the biological function of the device can deteriorate over time, you will have to renew your dewpal from time to time, meaning we are still creating plastic waste.As the purpose of our project was to contribute to a solution to the growing water shortage problem, we started delving into the literature, contacted experts in the various fields (3D printing, atmospheric water collection, ...) and had frequent brainstorm sessions with the team.We therefore definitely believe that we have the necessary ingredients (a cheap, small, easy to use & easy to stack device) in our dewpal recipe to become a game changer in the field of water collection.As the water gets collected, there will be a small risk that the attached bacteria will also find their way into the collected water as the bond between the biotin on the shape and the streptavidin on the bacteria is a very strong.As often done in practice, the vectors in our experiments are not self transducible, avoiding genetic material from being easily transferred.In one approach of our project we have attaching modified E. coli Top10 cells to our water collector.Throughout the course of the project we used his expertise as a guide for the designing and fine tuning of our model.The biological functional half sphere of your dewpal can be disconnected from your screwcap bottom, meaning the screwcap bottom could have a nearly endless life time, while only the biologically functional part would need replacement from time to time.Apart from providing easy and cheap access to clean drinking water, the sustainability and development of crops would also benefit enormously which in turn helps the economical situation in those countries.The benefits of the wide use of our dewpal device are huge.Note that this design isn t implemented yet by our shape group, but will be in the future.Our dewpal device consists of a 3D printed shape with a screwcap so it can be attached to water bottles.Around 1900 only 2% of the world population was under chronic water shortage while currently more than 1 billion people suffer from physical water scarcity and a quarter of the human population lack sufficient water due to economical reasons, such as the lack of infrastructure to take water from rivers and aquifers (Kummu et.It gave us the necessary determination to continue the work with true passion and dedication.Already from the beginning we had frequent conversations with Prof. Dan Fernandez, a leader in the field of atmospheric water collection.He shared his knowledge on 3D printing with us which led to significant improvements of the collector, more specifically on how the water is drained towards the centre of the shape.As the project went on, and after getting in touch with several humanitarian aid organisations (Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen, Protos, ... ), we had the growing believe that we could influence the lives of millions of people with the dewpal project.In the dewpal project, these strains are genetically engineered.Nevertheless, one should be aware of the public perception related to the use of GMOs for biotechnological applications, although it is in general less problematic compared to GMO plants or animals.All experiments were carried out in a contained laboratory environment (GMO-class 2 laboratory).Bacteria often have the capability of transferring genetic material, especially when self-transmissible vectors are used.We soon realized that the water scarcity problem is bigger than previously thought and generally assumed.Additionally, the device can be produced locally, if 3D-printers and filament are available or can be provided, reducing environmental and economic costs.By doing this, our device has a positive impact on reducing plastic waste, as empty plastic bottles can now be used as a water reservoir, prolonging their life as such.The cells themselves will not be used in applications, but only the cell-free bio-molecules they produce.The first could be to add a killing switch to the bacteria, or make the E. coli auxotrophic.This is exactly what we did with the Dewpal project: our shape is printed in cheap but sturdy materials resulting in low production costs, especially in mass production.This brings along no additional risk as the engineered strains are merely used as \u0091cell factories\u0091 in an enclosed environment.Additionally, in regions of physical water scarcity the average income per capita is rather low which hinders the development of infrastructures to collect freshwater (for example by filtering seawater) (see following picture).To improve the life quality of those billions of people, it is essential to create a cheap and efficient device to passively collect freshwater.During our project we also developed a new type of 3D printing material, but in order to make this into a useable filament, we needed a filament extruder.Furthermore, the environment will not be exposed to these modified organisms thanks to contained use and standard GLP.Also, since consuming polluted water and consequent diseases are a major hindrance in education, having access to sufficient clean drinking water will improve the level of education in those areas.Water scarcity is a major and growing problem worldwide.", "modeling": "This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in

simulation lab.Apart from our team, the people residing in this lab are specialized in developing mathematical models for a wide variety of applications such as waste water treatment, bioinformatics and urban air quality monitoring.As often done in practice, the vectors in our experiments are not self transducible, avoiding genetic material from being easily transferred.For our project, in one approach we are attaching modified E. coli Top10 cells to our water collector.Nevertheless, one should be aware of the public perception related to the use of GMOs for biotechnological applications, although it is in general less problematic compared to GMO plants or animals.All experiments were carried out in a contained laboratory environment (GMO-class 2 laboratory).Under the expert supervision of Kurt Van Houtte, FabLab s coordinator, a handful of 3D-printers were put to work for the creation of dewpal water collectors in all sizes and shapes.Our bacteria, Escherichia coli strain DH5a, Escherichia coli Top10 and Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 are standard non-pathogenic laboratory bacteria belonging to risk group 1.In addition, every member of our team got a (bio)safety and waste disposal training before performing our experiments in the lab.During the eventual execution of our experiments, we were supervised by our instructors who made sure we performed everything according to the safety regulations.Due to the diverse nature of the expert knowledge in this lab, it is an ideal environment for the development of out-of-the-box ideas for the computer-aided design of the dewpal and humidistat.Most of the dewpal prototypes were 3D-printed at UGent s FabLab, were an assortment of tools, 3D-printers and other computer controlled machines are available for this cause.All activities of this committee take place in close consultation with, amongst others, the facultary Environment, Hygiene and Safety Committee, the facultary Ethics Committee and with some Rectoral Services.In addition we have committed ourselves to both the national legal and ethical requirements compliance and the international and EU regulation compliance:Environmental regulation: Decree of the Flemish Government of 6 February 2004 amending the Decree of 6 February 1991 and the Decree of 1st June 1995\u0093Besluit van de Vlaamse regering van 6 februari 2004 tot wijziging van

2009/41/EC on contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms.As the water gets collected, there will be a small risk that the attached bacteria will also find their way into the collected water.Bacteria often have the capability of transferring genetic material, especially when self-transmissible vectors are used.In the dewpal project, these strains are genetically engineered.This brings along no additional risk as the engineered strains are merely used as \u0091cell factories\u0091 in an enclosed environment.Furthermore, the environment will not be exposed to these modified organisms thanks to contained use and standard GLP.Our experimental work is done in a GMO class 2 laboratory at the Department Biochemical and Microbial Technology at Ghent University.The Faculty of Bioscience Engineering at Ghent University, where our lab is situated, has its own facultary Biosafety Committee (only Dutch version of the website available).Guidelines more specific for working with GMOs can be found in the Biosafety in the laboratory document provided by the Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology.Our lab has its own Lab Manager, Gilles Velghe, who coordinates everything in the lab and is responsible for running the laboratory safely and efficiently.The first could be to add a killing switch to the bacteria, or make the E. coli auxotrophic.Every person who

Coli and sufficient for leupeptin production.LeupA has a predicted product similar in weight to the predicted 260 kDa for leupeptin synthase.Finally, natural leupeptin producers degrade leupeptin in the stationary phase, meaning we could see much higher yields with heterologous expression.We obtained three S. roseus strains and attempted to amplify leupA and leupB from the genome using primers to add the entire RFC[10] prefix and suffix, designed using the unassembled genome sequence of strain ATCC 31245.Both ocimene itself and E. coli with our pathway would be tested by the Crow Lab at Georgia State University for inhibition of P. destructans.Unfortunately, we were unable to assemble these plasmids for submission to the parts registry.Antifungals could kill fungi which compete with P. destructans on the bats\u0092 skin, or disrupt cave function.We instead began our plan for defending bats from White Nose Syndrome with the volatile compound ocimene.Additionally, the single ocimene synthase gblock was designed for direct RFC[10] digestion and ligation, with flanking VF2 and VR sites for amplification using existing primers.Leupeptin acid reductase was noted to always elute with leupeptin acid synthetase, and had an estimated weight of 320 kDa, almost identical to the combined weights of LeupA and B.Unfortunately, the biosynthesis of most protease inhibitors remains a mystery, but a recent preprint purports to have found a gene cluster in Streptomyces roseus responsible for the synthesis of leupeptin, commonly used in protease inhibitor cocktails (and expensive).Analysis of the P. destructans secretome found a serine endopeptidase, destructin-1, responsible for much of the fungus  ability to degrade collagen in bats\u0092 skin.The domains of leupA and B have homology to proteins with condensation actions similar to those proposed for the synthesis of leupeptin, including arginine and leucine.Our issue was exacerbated when no PCR primers were ordered for the amplification of individual gblocks, and stocks eventually ran out.These pathways were constructed from the codon-optimized genes of Enterococcus faecalis, Methanosarcina mazei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli, with one designed for optimum flux and the other providing extensibility for synthesis of other terpenes.PCR did not appear to amplify the desired products under a variety of conditions, with the long additions making the primers too long for use with the template, which has a GC content of over 70%.Bats with the fungus that survive until arousal in the spring have demonstrated an ability to recover from the disease.Finally, the codon-optimized ocimene synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana would be assembled in an additional plasmid to catalyze the final step of ocimene synthesis.We ruled out most candidates for leucine acetyltransferase that could have been included in the 70 kbp vector with BLAST results to known genes except for a 18.84 kDa hypothetical protein, which differs significantly from the 27 kDa observed previously and occurs upstream rather than downstream as Barona-G\u00f3mez suggested two additional genes may be.By 2012, the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimated at least 6 million bats had already succumbed to the disease, while state and federal agencies have scrambled to close off caves and protect unaffected bat populations.Additionally, damage to the thin wing membranes hinders flight while inducing a variety of physiological changes and inflammation.For an interactive map of the spread of

microbiologist of the Lascaux cave, who helped us analyzing the state of the cave and gave us precious scientific remarks concerning our project.More than his experience in the iGEM competition, it is his constant presence during the whole project that ensured a good follow-up.Gilles Truan, our scientific project manager.We are grateful to Yvan Cam, who took time to work with us on this cloning and helped us with the problems met.Working on fungi was a necessity to test the module associated.The creation of the predator-prey model took time, and Souka\u00efna Timouma, member of the iGEM Toulouse team and student in bioinformatics, could not face with both the modelisation and the wiki designing without help.All the members of our team have assumed every aspect of the project, from the beginning to the end of it.Thank you for your support and help.Pierre Reitzer, consultant from the iGEM Toulouse 2014 team.We worked hard on our wonderful project, and we spent so much time in the lab that now we know its interior in great detail!We are really grateful to Christelle Labruy\u00e8re, communication officer of the LISBP, for her common sense and her tips to communicate with the general public.Furthermore, the universities where we study are a precious help to mediatize our project, particularly throughout the social networks.The team presentation page contains drawings of the team members made by Esther Coutant, and we are grateful to her.Having a good presentation at the Giant Jamboree is important as it represents the purpose of the project.It is a real roller coaster!This project about the Lascaux cave was borned in April 2016, when we chose our subject for the iGEM competition.Christophe Roux helped us by providing fungi strains, and advising us about protocols and the best ways to use them.We have posted our Paleotilis project on this site to collect funds for allowing at least one member of the team to participate to the Giant Jamboree.We also thank David Cribbs and Marie-Line Daveran-Mingot who helped us fundraising.We would like to thank Jara Radeck, from the iGEM Munich 2012 team, for providing us shuttle plasmids between Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli bacteria, from their own project.We also would like to thank the people who helped us during our brainstorming sessions to find the most appropriate subject for our project:

PoueymiroThe Lascaux cave is a world heritage that is accessible to a few number of people, and reviews about it are quite rare.Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle, as director of the national prehistory museum, encouraged us in our activity.The aim of the predation module was to improve the efficiency of Bacillus subtilis to target bacteria and to use them as carbon sources.Their advice and their experience were useful and helped us being more efficient on the experiments of the antifungals module.Our script evolved under the supervision of Matthieu Pouget, artistic director and teacher at the University of Toulouse 2.It was important for our team to explain to the general public what the synthetic biology is.We would like to address a special thank to Serge Mazeres and to Arnaud Volle, from the IPBS laboratory, for their help on the use of the Blender software.He lived the iGEM competition as a student in 2014, and could step back and advise us in function of his own experience.St\u00e9phanie Heux, consultant of our team.For our predation module, Philipp Popp accepted to provide us with strains containing constructions with sdpI.We also would like to address our special thanks to all the researchers who gave us crucial strains and plasmids for our Paleotilis project.He brought to the team his skills and background about the competition and synthetic biology.Getting Pseudomonas fluorescens strains was essential, as it is one of the microorganisms present in the Lascaux cave.Thus we are grateful to Chrystelle Bonnabau and Brigitte Taoui, communication officer at INSA Toulouse and at the Paul Sabatier university respectively, for their investment and their graciously contribution in goodies for the events in which we took part.Our Ulule contributors, on the crowfunding plateformUlule is the first European crowdfunding website.", "background": "", "description": "The colonies were issued from the transformation of B. subtilis by pSB1C3-Orikan (assays), by the pSBBS0K-P plasmid (negative control), or from the transformation of E. coli by pSB1C3-Orikan (positive control).These results demonstrate that the OriKan biobrick is sufficient to turn any pSB1C3 plasmid into aThe start of our project has been complicated by the absence of available replicative plasmid forBacillus subtilis in the registry.After digestion by EcoRI and PstI and ligation in the pSB1C3 plasmid, the resulting pSB1C3-OriKan plasmid was obtained (right part of the figure).The fragment was then sub-cloned in the pSB1C3 plasmid (between the EcoRI/PstI restriction sites).We checked the capacity of this new pSB1C3-Orikan plasmid to maintain in Bacillus subtilis and wewere delighted to obtain clones.This new plasmid wasthen used to create most of the Bacillus subtilis parts of our project, demonstrating itsefficiency as a new backbone for Bacillus based projects.OriKan (new part BBa_K1937002): and they all became Bacillus plasmids\u0085With the success of the pSBBS0K-Mini, we decided that we should try to go even further by isolatingwhat is the very essence of this replicative Bacillus plasmid: its Bacillus repU origin and its kanamycinresistance gene.Position of the primers are indicated by the blue arrow on pSBBS0K-P (left part of the figure).Position of the primers are indicated by the blue arrow on pSBBS0K-P (left part of the figure).Only one of such plasmid is described in the iGEM registry (pSBBS0K-P from iGEM Munich 2012; BBa_K823026 and its slightly modified form BBa_K1351040).After digestion by NheI and self-ligation, the resulting pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid was obtained (right part of the figure).The new plasmid size is smaller by 3604 bp.The sequence integrity of the OriKan cassette was also verified.Figure 3: validation of the pSB1C3-Orikan presence in B. subtilis.Nhe1 restriction site was also added at the 5\u0092 end of each primers to circularize the PCRFigure 1: reduction of the pSBBS0K-P plasmid.We therefore decided to operate a reduction of the plasmid size.We reasoned that most of the pSBBS0K-P plasmid content were of no need to our project (lacY, rfp,lacI\u0085).There was no such part in the registry.The resulting PCR fragment is the blue pointed line.The resulting PCR fragment is the blue pointed line.Itscapacity to simply functionalize any registry part for Bacillus subtilis (and likely some other grampositive strains) is invaluable for the ever growing numbers of iGEM projects based on theseorganisms.In this context, obtaining the pSBBS0K-Minihas been a great step forward for us as it allowed a fast progression of our project cloning steps.Moreover, we are also very proud of the OriKan biobrick.PCR on colonies was performed using primers hybridizing in the kanamycine resistance gene and in the suffix.", "design": "Besides, Bacillus species are inhabitants of the cave (Martin-Sanchez et al, 2014) and Bacillus subtilis is a model microorganisms with well-established genetic possibilities, i.e, the perfect chassis for our project (Figure 2).Figure 2: In the cave, Pseudomonas species degrade the antifungal molecules previously used to prevent mould apparition.Our Bacillus strain will develop from Pseudomonas, and in contact to fungi, will produce antifungal molecules to prevent mould development.Two independent operons have been reported to allow for the predation property of Bacillus subtilis: the sporulation killing factor (skf) and the sporulation delay protein (sdp) (Gonzalez-Pastor et al, 2003; Ellermeier et al, 2006; Gonzalez-Pastor, 2011).NheI, SacII and SalI restrictions sites were added to further facilitate the modules assembly.To express the antifungal peptides only in presence of the fungi, we selected the Bacillus promoter of nagA and nagP, reported to be induced in presence of NAG (Bertram et al., 2011).5 different molecules were selected:- D4E1, a 17 amino acids synthetic peptide analog to Cecropin B AMPs which has been shown to have antifungal activities by complexing with a sterol present in the conidia\u0092s wall of numerous fungi (De Lucca et al, 1998).We also designed the toxin/antitoxin systems in a way that one of the toxin gene could be inserted in the middle of the antifungal operon (SacII/SalI insertion, figure 8).These lead us to divide our project in three modules (Containment, Predation, Antifungal; Figure 1).Figure 1: Bacillus subtilis transformed with the two plasmids carrying the elements necessary to promote predation, to prevent the plasmid dissemination, and to produce antifungals molecules.The Lascaux history has proved that any molecule addition could result in major and unexpected modifications of the cave microbiota.One plasmid contains antitoxin 1 and toxin 2, the other contains antitoxin 2 and toxin 1.Figure 6: concept of the double toxin/antitoxin system.The two pairs of Toxin-Antitoxin combinations selected for this project are MazF/MazE (Bravo et al., 1987, Zhang et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2013) and Zeta/Epsilon (Zielenkiewicz and Ceg?owski, 2005 ; Mutschler et al., 2011).Since their expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, we decided to replace their promoter by pVeg for a constitutive expression (Figure 3).This molecule is the major component of chitin found at the surface of the fungi.To simplify the cloning, we designed two genetics modules: Antifungal A and Antifungal B. Antifungal A expresses the cut Metchnikowin and D4E1, while Antifungal B produces entire Metchnikowin, GAFP-1 and Dermaseptin-b1 (figure 4).We circumvented this difficulty by taking advantage of the predatory property of Bacillus subtilis: in starvation condition, one program of Bacillus is to produce toxins to kill other bacteria such as Pseudomonas species and to develop from their materials (Nandy et al, 2007).As we did not know if this cleavage is essential for the antifungal activity, we choose to use either the cut or entire form of this peptide (Levashina et al, 1995).Since treating with antifungal molecules has proved to be at the best a limited option, we wonder about how to produce antifungal in a targeted and efficient way.Since a variety of mould has been identified to cause problem in the cave, we wanted a wide spectrum solution and decided for an antifungal cocktail.The toxin and antitoxin are under control of the pVeg constitutive promoter for Bacillus subtilis (BBa_K143012; Figure 5).The EcoRI/NheI fragment containing a pNag promoter (figure 5) will have to be swapped with the EcorI/NheI fragment containing the pVeg promoter of the antifungal operon (figure 4).This peptide is membranotropic and depolarizes the fungi plasma membrane (Fleury et al, 1998).- GAFP-1 (Gastrodia Anti Fungal Protein 1), a mannose and chitin binding lectin originating from the Asiatic orchid Gastrodia elata, that inhibits the growth of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungal plant pathogens (Wang et al, 2001).For example, the antifungal molecules abundantly used to fight against fungi infection have been degraded by Pseudomonas fluorescens, and this degraded molecules are used by fungi to proliferate\u0085 A major constraint we imposed to our project was thus to avoid adding nutriment in the cave.25: 651\u0096661Our project involved release of a genetically modified bacteria in the cave.The description of the device structure and use is available in the Modeling section.All the parts from the three modules were designed to be easily assembled (Figure 9).To valid the expression and specificity of these promoters, the RFP reporter gene has been placed under their control (Figure 5).These sequences encodes the necessary elements to produce, mature and secrete the killing factors, as well as the immunity agents to prevent lethality of the producing cells.Ellermeier CD, Errett CH, Gonzalez-Pastor JE, and Losick R (2006) A Three-Protein Signaling Pathway Governing Immunity to a Bacterial Cannibalism Toxin.RFP expression was also added in prevision of a visualisation of the strain during test on stones.Figure 3: Predation constructions.44: 514\u0096520 Fleury Y, Vouille V, Beven L, Amiche M, Wr\u00f3blewski H, Delfour A & Nicolas P (1998) Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and gene structure of a novel member of the dermaseptin B family.It was mandatory to ensure the best confinement strategy for our strain, to limit the material input in the cave and to ensure antifungal production only when required.The rationale for this was to have the toxin as close as possible to the antifungal molecule to further reduce the risk of antifungal gene horizontal transfer.For the secretion of these antifungal compounds, we added the AmyE signal peptide in N-terminal of each coding sequences.NheI restrictions sites were added to further facilitate the modules assembly.Bertram R, Rigali S, Wood N, Lulko AT, Kuipers OP & Titgemeyer F (2011) Regulon of the N-acetylglucosamine utilization regulator NagR in Bacillus subtilis.This has two valuable advantages: (i) no substrate are required when using the bacteria, and (ii) our Bacillus will reduce the deleterious population of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Martin-Sanchez et al, 2011).The device has been designed to be stuck on the cave wall and to be easily manipulated.Finally, if we decided to use the common Bacillus subtilis 168 strain for the modules validation, the final chassis was choosen to be a double mutant Spo0A- recA-.581: 151\u009656.The Paleotilis project main idea is to contain the fungi patch progression in the Lascaux cave.Identification of components of a new stability system of plasmid R1, ParD, that is close to the origin of replication of this plasmid.It is unusual in the sense theophylline riboswitches usually work in the inverse way (Topp and Gallivan, 2008).Developing a biological solution to protect one of the most invaluable humanity heritage is a beautiful challenge.The risk to release a GMO in the cave is mainly in the horizontal gene transfer to native bacteria.Since each fragment contains a toxin but not its corresponding antitoxin, we needed a strategy to avoid cell death during the cloning steps.Besides, we wanted to express these peptides only in close vicinity of the fungi.We decided for a double toxin-antitoxin system (Figure 6).Indeed, at this step of the project, the risk about using this GMO in the cave is unknown.193: 3525\u00963536 De Lucca AJ, Bland JM, Grimm C, Jacks TJ, Cary JW, Jaynes JM, Cleveland TE & Walsh TJ (1998) Fungicidal properties, sterol binding, and proteolytic resistance of the

construction during the validation assays.The SacII and SalI restriction sites were added to simplify the modules assembly.Figure 7: toxin/antitoxin constructions for each plasmidBravo A, de

"Thus, the Lascaux cave is a work of art, it deserves to exist, to be maintained and protected.We should never consider Nature and living beings solely as work tools.In the European Union, the legal definition of GMO is mentioned in the 2001/18 directive: a GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) is \u0093an organism, with the exception of human beings, whose genetic makeup has been modified via methods that do not occur in nature and/or through traditional crossbreeding methods\u0094.However, the regulation regarding GMOs varies from a country to another as far as research, production, marketing and their use are concerned.Indeed, at the time of the Renaissance, an interesting definition of art appears: it is a disinterested and free activity, pleasant in itself, having no utility for production.However, after getting in touch with scientists and people working in the Lascaux cave, it turned out that we will be able to test our genetically modified bacteria in a \"cave test\".Among others, we contacted Yvan Mo\u00ebnne-Loccoz, part of the scientific council of the Lascaux cave and Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle Director of the National Museum of Prehistory.It is obvious that any project involving the release of genetically modified bacteria in an ecosystem, needs an in-depth studies to evaluate the evolution of the ecosystem following the addition of a genetically modified native bacterium.Although the issues raised by OGM in the public mainly concern plants (GMP) and more recently also animals (GMA) including Human because of the ease of manipulate organisms with the powerful CRISPR-Cas9 tools, we need to think about the ethics of our iGEM project and share our thinking with the public.To fuel our thinking, beside reading few publications, we were lucky enough to be able to regularly discuss with Dr Vincent Gr\u00e9goire-Delory, Head of the \u0093Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d\u0092Ethique des Sciences\u0094 in Toulouse.It belongs to no one and is not the object of desire: it is there for contemplation of a generation, and then transmitted to the next.These frescoes show the representation that men had of their world 18,000 years ago.It carries a message and a memory of the Paleolithic man.Some philosophers of aesthetics, defined art as \"sensitive knowledge\": an autonomous knowledge which is opposed to knowledge through concepts.Thus, it is necessary to know what might be the impact of our modified microorganism on the environment before using it to treat the caves.For the artist, art is also used to escape and to express themselves.It is through the power and intelligence of men that we can organize the formless and chaos of the real world in a style, an expression.Against this statistic and for modestly contribute to the fight for men-women parity, we would like to demonstrate that only complementary skills are the secret ingredient to the success in this competition, beyond the gender.At the heart of the synthetic biology iGEM competition is the modification of microorganisms and therefore the creation of genetically modified microorganisms (GMM), a sub-category of the genetically modified organisms (OGM) that also include higher organisms such as animals and plants.Alongside more traditional methods currently used against these fungi, we decided to act with the most modern means from this emerging science that is synthetic biology, to contribute to the preservation of an ancient heritage and to ensure its transmission to future generations.Whatever would be the answer, we believe that respecting living beings first and foremost rests on scientific integrity and rigor, a realization of all the implications of the scientific project, the precise knowledge of its content, and finally the establishment of security measure.This art does not represent the time of the hunting scenes as one might imagine.While participating to an exhibition on genetics at the \u0093Museum d\u0092Histoire Naturelle\u0094 in Toulouse, we also have had the opportunity to discuss with Dr Anne Cambon-Thomsen, Head of the \u0093Plateforme G\u00e9n\u00e9tique & Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u0094 of Toulouse and member of European ethics committees.From all these readings and discussions, we realized that as far as ethics issues are concerned, there are two main point of views, anthropocentrism vs biocentrism, that would deeply impact on the outcome of any debate.General considerations.Is it a lack of respect to nature and the living in general to insert a gene controlling insulin production into a bacterium if that means saving thousands of human lives?Let\u0092s not forget that the Lascaux cave is not an usual work of art, not only by age but especially by the presence of life.Like the links of a long human chain, the Lascaux cave shows to future generations a work executed by ancient men.In spite of the absence of definite answer, we can question ourselves differently: when is an organism considered \u0093modified\u0094?We have also participated to a workshop on Genetically Modified Microorganism organized by the \u0093Plateforme G\u00e9n\u00e9tique & Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u0094 whose guest stars were Pr Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent from Paris, members of ethics committees and Pr.However, it is sometimes difficult to quantify the risks and visualize the limit between what could be really dangerous for humanity and what is not.Thereby, thanks to the awareness raised to this debate, numerous precautions have been taken to avoid the dissemination of GMOs, because the scientific community does not know their exact effects on the environment.Will we actually counteract this law of nature by saving the frescoes in the cave?In fact, the cave has a very complex ecosystem, diverse and constantly interacting.Places as amazing and diverse as the Serra da Capivara National Park in Brazil, the Pyramids of Egypt, Trogir historic town in Croatia are the heritage of our world.Sphinx and Chephren-Pyramid, Serra da Capivara National Park (Brazil), Historic city of TrogirAmong the 1052 world treasures that need to be saved, the Lascaux cave and the impressive frescos by their number and aesthetic quality are listed since October 1979 (ICOMOS Recommendation).Even today, ephemeral art is practiced for example in the Landart.However, efforts are still needed for a much fair treatment of women in order to grant full equality in all countries around the world.In the left: Caroline Herschel , in the right: Marie CurieThus today, what is happening is that only 8 young women are involved in the iGEM adventure in Toulouse.Formerly simply meaning \"study of the living\", it is now more complex because we are able to transform the living.Indeed, the walls of the cave are partially and gradually covered with black and white mushrooms that hide the frescoes.Respectively : Sand Art Festival Tossens, Localisation of the Lascaux cave, The lascaux caveWhy save art?He adds that if there are many consequences possible when using a technology, one has to decide [to use the technology or not] according to the most pessimistic hypothesis.In France, this principle is applied for the use of GMOs and allows avoiding to the maximum the risks endangering health and the environment.For many prehistorians, the cave is actually a sanctuary, a sort of religious monument.Not to say, we are quite proud of the results!Thus, Nietzsche promotes art as the purest and spiritual entertainment.There is no parietal cave in the world that matches it in terms of the quality and variety of the finds (skeletons, objects, flint, various utensils).This study shows that the ecosystem\u0092s modification in this project is not significant.It states that \u0093the lack of certainties, given the scientific and technical knowledge of the moment, shall not delay the adoption of effective and proportionate measures that aim to prevent a risk of severe and irreversible harm to the environment to a cost economically acceptable\u0094.This allowed the estimate of the risks associated with the future use of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) in crops.For the NASA, \u0093life is an auto-maintained system, capable of Darwinian evolution\u0094 (Gerald Joyce, 1992).It is thus important to act responsibly, with integrity and full conscience, and to evaluate the risks linked to using GMOs.The Lascaux caves since 1979 belongs to the World Heritage of UNESCO.The opening of the cave by humans causing an imbalance in the ecosystem, one would think it\u0092s only coherent that men attempt to repair their mistakes.The site is particularly interesting from ethnological, anthropological and aesthetic point of views, marking a milestone in the history of prehistoric art and our human culture.The questions raised are often linked to them, but the confusion is present and the reluctance seems to affect all GMOs.The risks are not the same for each category of GMOs, and to the best of our knowledge, for the moment no major health or environmental problems associated to MGMs have been reported despite more than 70 years of MGMs manipulation in academic or private laboratories.Regarding specifically the scientific area, many women have raised the flag of parity such as Caroline Herschel, the first woman recognized as scientist but also the first one to publish a scientific paper in 1786 about the discovery of a comet, or such as Marie Curie who obtained two Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry.Indeed, the ecosystem of the cave is very delicate and vital for the preservation of the frescoes.Indeed, one may think that science is useful only when it is in the service of health or the environment.This peculiar and quite funny situation has somehow triggered our thinkingabout the actual position of women in Science, specially taking into account that our principalResults of a vast survey on the role of women in scientific research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group were published in March 2014 in the European Union, show that only 11% of the highest academic posts are occupied by women in science subjects.As far as the iGEM competition is concerned, only genetically modified microorganisms are pertinent.Mahaffee, W. F. & Kloepper, J. W. Bacterial communities of the rhizosphere and endorhiza associated with field-grown cucumber plants inoculated with a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium or its genetically modified derivative.Indeed, the birth of synthetic biology has created a revolution in the world of biology as important as the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Watson and Crick or the first complete sequencing of a human genome in 2003.Indeed, American policy is based on the product of gene modification techniques, not on the process itself.It is with the PGMs that the debate has emerged.At the end of the selection process, it turned out that the most appropriate candidates were all women!As said before, the walls of the cave are partially and gradually covered with black and white fungi that hide the frescoes.Or maybe, we could be satisfied with the survival to transmit this work as long as possible to the future generations?It may be possible in the near future to get the same results for our project and why not imagine being able to reopen the cave to the public in the future?1.Actually the selection to be part of the team was made based on the skill and motivation of the student and not on his gender.These disappear with the tide and weather.Notwithstanding, wildlife depicted on walls of the cave does not match the species hunted and consumed at the time.A single reindeer engraved was found when it seems that it was very consumed at the time.P\u00e8re Puigdomenech from Barcelona, member of European ethics committees, co-organized by the \u0093Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, Inscriptions et Belles Lettres\u0094 of Toulouse.Thus it enables taking safety precautions even if the risk in question is not demonstrated or proven.It gives an encouraging result for the use of synthetic biology.Actually more than 300 definitions have been collected by the astrophysicist Radu Popa (2010).In France, the confined use of GMMs is subject, via the 2009/41/CE directive, to a system of notification and authorization.Indeed, others techniques exist at present to try to slow the progression of fungi in the Lascaux caves.The field of biology evolves very quickly thanks to the technological advances that we witness day by day.We need to remove the black and white fungi while preserving the balance of the ecosystem.A very interesting law was written in 1995: the Barnier\u0092s law, more known as the precautionary principle.Their irruption in the production processes went almost unnoticed.Clearly, women are underrepresented in scientific professions.Nevertheless, these percentages are slowly increasing, mainly because women are fighting for to reach the goal that the parity would be respected in all levels of society.We have also attended a seminar on genome editing given by the Pr.Moreover, despite all our efforts, the world tends toward entropy (second law of thermodynamics), which means that the universe tends toward disorder and disintegration.It is natural that suspicion emerges in the minds of the public when they only have a vague idea of ??what this new discipline is, and the safety measures implemented to minimize the risks.The regulation is based on other criteria than the ones applied inside the European Union.This prehistoric site is located in the French countryside.Still, the frescoes are extremely realistic in terms of morphology and attitudes of animals.In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Buddhist conceived mandalas (support for meditation and visualization, symbol of the universe) in the sand (very sensitive material overtime).Indeed, the World Heritage sites belong to everyone, irrespective of the territory in which they are located.In 1946, representatives of 37 countries met in London to sign and enforce the Constitution UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), defining the concept of world heritage and establishing an initial list of this heritage.They were even perceived well since they were able to engender more reliable products, as it was the case with the production of the growth hormone.The regulation is founded on verifiable risks and does not focus on the risks that were not proven (for more details see the precautionary principle).As mentioned in the introduction, distinction must be done between different kinds of GMOs (GMMs, PGMs, etc\u0085).", "modeling": "Therefore the simulation should help us know how much bacteria should be used to treat the mould patches, when the job is finished, and when the bacteria should have disappeared.It was designed has a simple interface (figure 2) and is totally open to the iGEM community and beyond (Link coming soon).Figure 2: image of the prey-predator model interface.The confinement device (figure 4) was designed has a transparent glass bell (5) mounted on a soft sucking pad (6) to stick to the cave wall.To predict how the strain will behave in the cave environment, we decided to use a modeling strategy and created a prey-predator model.These numbers will be implemented in the model to refine its prediction and hence optimize the approach until the results are satisfying enough to start test in laboratory caves.Perspectives: the laboratory cave and other applicationsThe described iterative approach will help to settle the best conditions to apply our project in the Lascaux cave.Each one of them could help respond to a particular issue of the Lascaux cave and all of them combined would tackle all the aspect of the Lascaux cave\u0092s situation.The concept of our project could be used for other applications as well.Optionally, an UV ramp could be mounted inside the chamber, either to reveal the bacteria if they express a fluorescent marker, or to ensure killing of the recA- Bacillus strain (this background allows reducing the risk of recombination \u0096 see the design part-, and is therefore very sensitive to UV).The device will have to be used during test on stone in laboratory condition.These caves are all located in France, and have similarities with the Lascaux cave in terms of bacterial and fungal populations.It means using the strain to treat mould patches as it would be done in the cave.However, each cave is unique and the microbiologists that work on the cave decided to develop a network of laboratory caves.Once satisfactory predictions are obtained, the next step toward the laboratory cave would be initiated.Figure 1: description of our strategy to anticipate the use of Paleolitis in the Lascaux cave.We conceived this step as an iterative strategy (figure 1).They therefore use laboratory caves where various treatments are performed and fully analysed before deciding to use them directly on the cave.There are experts in such approaches and we decided to focus on the step between the completion of our strain and this laboratory validation.The cave is very poor in growth substrates and the production of toxin should also make the bacteria unstable.They also do not act on the cave until they know the exact consequences of the treatments they plan on applying.We therefore assumed that the Paleolitis strain should not maintain in this environment.We designed a prey-predator model to predict how Paleolitis and the fungi will behave.Anyway, such a test could be easily adapted to try out the model predictions and the device functionality.Sampling during and after the predicted time could be done and qRT-PCR performed to measure how the fungal and bacterial populations evolved.At the end of our summer work, our strain Paleolitis was not complete yet.Bacterial suspension at the concentration indicated by the model is placed in the chamber (1).The device is placed on top of the mould patch and bacterial suspension is sprayed on the confined surface (figure 5) using the sprinkler inside the bell (3).We felt that we should use all the solutions available for the confinement and we designed a device to physically contain our strain during the treatment.We deposited on the stones several mixes including ochre, substrates, Bacillus subtilis expressing the antifungal AF_A operon, and fungi (figure 6).", "notebook": "Moreover, in order to reduce the size of our replicative plasmid pSB0K-P, we designed primers that were supposed to amplify both the origin of replication and the antibiotic resistance gene for B. subtilis and E. coli.The bacteria we are modifying is supposed to improve the predation capacity of B. subtilis.By amplifying by PCR pSB0K-P to select only the kanamycine gene and the replication origin in B. subtilis, and by ligating it with pSB1C3, we should obtain a plasmid replicative in E. coli and in B. subtilis.As the cloning with pNagA is validated, we started trying to clone this insert in the shuttle plasmid pSB0K-P from 2012 iGEM Munich team, and to transform it in E. coli.Thus, we start trying to clone the good amplicons in the backbone pSB1C3, but it fail because of a lack of genetic material.We asked to iGEM Munich 2012 to send us four shuttle backbones, that can be used in E. Coli as well as in B. subtilis.The bacteria that our B. subtilis is supposed to limit the growth is Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25.We have done PCR on the big pSB0K-P plasmid to reduce its size, from 9,3 kbp to 5,7 kbp, hoping the cloning will become easier.It was useful to determine if our B. subtilis is able to affect the growth of other bacteria.The plasmid pSB0K-Mini can be replicated in E. coli, but the antibiotic resistance functional in this bacterium is the ampicillin.For the modelling, we designed the prey-predator model to have a simulation of the activity of our modified B. subtilis.We continued trying to clone our insert pNagA in the shuttle plasmid pSB0K-P, using different strategies.The cloning of our three inserts in the pSB0K-Mini worked, and we also succeed in transforming B. subtilis with these constructions.The problems with the Gibson cloning are still present, but the origin of the disturbance is unknown.We started to test our promoter pNagA in B. subtilis.Due to these data we determined the doubling time of each conditions, and we selected the best one.Now that the small version of the plasmid pSB0K-P is circularized, we transformed it in Bacillus subtilis.In addition, the antibiotic resistance genes would be the one expected: chloramphenicol for E. coli, and kanamycine for B. subtilis.We used these strains in order to: have a positive control when our bacteria will be functional, test the efficiency of the antifungals, and find the best temperature, medium and technique.We started to clone our gBlocks pNagA, mazF and AfA in this plasmid.Problems with the cloning in pSB1C3 of our predation genes were still present.As the gBlocks were received, we did PCR to amplify them and create a stock.In order to determine if our bacteria is more efficient than the wild type bacteria, we have done predation tests by using the strain WT 168.We have done PCR, digestion, ligation, and transformation for clonings during a week, being supervised by PhD students.In parallel, we finished ordering gBlocks from IDT, and we refined the gene design.First of all, we had to digest the backbone pSB1C3, which have to received each of our parts.We designed it using Blender.The transformation of E. coli with the construction of a NagA inducible promoter in pSB1C3 worked, it was the first big step!The clonings did not work.As the PCR of gBlocks do not work very well, we designed other primers to improve the compatibility between the template and the primers.In 2014, the iGEM Toulouse team worked on fungi, and constructed strains able to secrete antifungals.We have done experiments realizing cultures in different conditions during the all day, and we measured the OD every hour.What we have done: ordered the material (enzymes, kit\u0085)necessary for the projectHaving a good control of the basic experiments, as enzymatic digestion or transformation for example, is important to ensure the lab work during the summer.We tried different programs, by modifying the elongation time or the hybridization temperature.The genes (sdp and skf) for our predation module should be cloned by the Gibson method.Dry lab: Now that the subject is defined, and that the bibliography is done, let\u0092s prepare our constructions!We also determined what was the more efficient between using the supernatant, the bacteria, or a mix of both.Nevertheless this plasmid is quite big (>9 kbp) and thus it is harder to clone than a smallest plasmid.", "protocol": "Transfer the GeneJET purification column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge

coli, or to try a direct transformation of highly competent Bacillus strain.Here, we aimed to produce a cocktail of five antifungal peptides whose production in Bacillus subtilis will be triggered by presence of fungi.The whole antifungal operon was too big to be synthesized by IDT as one gblock.).At this step, we can only hypothesize that our system is leaking sufficient expression of the toxins for them to be lethal, either in E. coli or in B. subtilis.Again, we can only speculate about the toxicity of the toxin.To validate the theophylline riboswitch, we inferred that we should obtain clones of Bacillus subtilis transformed with the pSBBS0K-Mini \u0096Epsilon/MazF only in presence of theophylline: the molecule should prevent the expression of the MazF toxin that is lethal since the antitoxin MazE is not present.However, we did not manage to obtain the whole assembly (figure 2), neither partial ones, in spite of about 20 attempts\u0085The SDP operon is smaller than the SKF one and it was possible to obtain the optimized sequences as two gblocks.Figure 11: Result of the Bacillus subtilis transformation with pSBBS0K-Mini \u0096Epsilon/MazF (we know this is not the most illustrative figure ever!They were subsequently cloned in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobricks BBA_K1937004 and BBa_K1937006.We tested the expression and specificity of the RFP driven by pNagA and pNagP when growing in presence of glucose or NAG (figure 7).However, we did not manage to obtain the second operon in the pSB1C3 (encoding Dermaseptin B1, GAFP-1 and entire Metchnikowin antifungal peptides).The predation system is based on the production of toxins by B. subtilis, and these toxins were reported to be harmful to E. coli (Nandy et al., 2007, FEBS Letters.The fungi were then inoculated on each spot whereas our therapeutic agent only on Spot 8.Figure 9: Test on the rock inoculated with Talaromyces funiculosum at T=0 (on the left) and T=3 weeks post infection (on the right).After 3 weeks, the growth of fungi was clearly visible on spots 1 to 6, with the most efficient growth on the spot 3 which had the following medium composition:Interestingly, no growth of the fungus was observed on spots 7 and 8.The AF_A operon was subsequently cloned in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobrick BBA_K1937008.Figure 5: Layout of antifungal operons and their assembly.In order to express specifically the antifungal peptides in close vicinity to fungi, we choose the two N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG) inducible promotors pNagA and pNagP.In conclusion, pNagA and pNagP appear as able to promote expression in response to NAG, even if the growth conditions could be improved to get higher and more homogeneous expression levels.Figure 7: NAG-driven expression of RFP.The first step was therefore to be able to grow fungi on rocks.In order to do so, we have deposed on the surface of the rocks growth media with various nutriment compositions (see Table 1).However, the ability to get the fungi grown on rock was already a good result, indicating that we might have a good model to test our bacteria.Red spots appeared only with pNagA or pNagP on NAG (close-ups on part 7B).We found out that the best culture conditions for the fungi that permits a slight growth of Bacillus were with \u00bc PDA and 2% glucose.We observed that the reaction seems to be effective with the presence of a new band corresponding to the combined size of the two gblocks (figure 4).The Epsilon/MazF construction was rapidly sub-cloned in the pSB1C3 backbone (new composite part BBa_K1937009), and then in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobricks BBa_K1937010 (figure 10).We tested the predation of B. subtilis Wild Type (strain 168) against Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain SBW25), a deleterious strain present in the cave.Briefly, the protocol consists in growing both strains in rich medium, mixing them in PBS and monitoring their growth (figure 1).To get rid of restriction sites that could interfere with the cloning steps, we ordered the optimized sequences from IDT as four gblocks.In both cases, the properties will have to be optimized, through a higher and more homogeneous expression from the NAG-driven promoters and through the completion of the antifungal operons to produce more than two antifungal peptides.We were able to set up a model which mimics the cave s environment.Our aim is to reinforce the natural predation capacity of B. subtilis and to ensure it is expressed independantly of the conditions.An explanation to our problems could be that SDP and SKF cloning in E. coli results in the bacterium death.The late expression could mean that the formulation of our minimal medium is not optimal.The fact that the pNagA-RFP and pNagP-RFP strains seem able to slightly express the RFP on glucose (figure 7B, left panel close-up), albeit on weaker extend that on NAG (figure 7B, right panel close-up), could be due to the alleviating of the catabolic repression.The constructions with the RFP reporter gene were ordered from IDT and successfully sub-cloned in the pSB1C3 (new parts BBa_K1937003 and BBa_K1937005 ; figure 6).We tested different fungi (Aspergillus niger, Talaromyces funiculosus and Chaetomium globosum) but we eventually focussed on Talaromyces funiculosus that seems easier to manipulate to us.Our test consisted in adding, on fungi inoculated plates, paper patches soaked with either copper sulfate (positive control), LB medium (negative control), a suspension of Bacillus subtilis WT or Bacillus subtilis expressing the antifungal AF_A operon (figure 8).These observations allow us to conclude that AF_A is functional.As our therapeutic bacterium was supposed to treat fungi growing on the walls of a cave, we needed to test its activity in conditions that would mimic the cave\u0092s environment.However, we never managed to get the MazE/Zeta construction in the pSB1C3 backbone.We had thought about this problem, but we had believed the expression driven by the pVeg Bacillus promoter to be insufficient for such effect.From there, our strategy was to do Gibson cloning to obtain the full operon in pSB1C3 in E. coli and then to transfer it in B. subtilis.We hypothesize that one of the peptide could be toxic for E. coli.Thanks to it, we got encouraging results showing that the therapeutic agent might be functional.Here, we fashioned a genetic system to prevent horizontal transfer of our synthetic constructions.As the later one contained our therapeutic agent, this observation suggested that our modified bacterium might be active against the fungi.The red color of the spots was due to ochre, whose purpose was to mimic the frescoes of the cave (See Figure below).Sub-cloning of the first operon (containing cut version of the Metchnikowin and D4E1) on the pSB1C3 backbone was rapidly performed, leading to the new composite part BBa_K1937007 (pSB1C3-AF_A).The sequence were optimized for the Bacillus codon usage and to remove inadequate restriction sites.However, the absence of growth on Spot 7 would argue against this conclusion.", "safety": "This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.We have to apply the basic safety principles in all laboratory rooms:- It is forbidden to drink and eat in the laboratory rooms.- It is compulsory to wear a closed lab coat in cotton.- Oral pipetting of any substance is prohibited in any laboratory.There are also others precautions when working with biological organisms:- It is compulsory to wear gloves except for the use of an electric burner.- In some cases (UV light, projection risk), it is compulsory to wear protection glasses.- Equipments: As soon as we manipulate in the lab, we have to wear the following personal protective equipments (a conventional lab coat, closed with long sleeves, closed shoes, gloves, glasses if needed).A specific trash can is dedicated to gloves or paper and another is dedicated to the agarose gels that were contaminated.- Chemical hood: We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals (for example: the usage of alcohol 96\u00b0)We have described above the relevant security measures taken all through summer to minimize the risk of incidents in the lab.--> Legislation and French Labor Law: We work in a public school for engineers (INSA Toulouse), thus we have to respect the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms.Abstract: In the lab, we have to respect numerous safety regulations for the security and health of others and the environment.As we work with microorganisms and cell cultures, we are concerned by the regulation on workers\u0092 protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No.First of all, we have designed a physical device that would confine our engineered bacteria to the area to be treated (see the device part).However, when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the public and the environment.We have used E. coli and B. subtilis chassis, since their genomes are very well characterized and, of course, since these bacteria are non-pathogenic.Moreover, the French regulation does not allow any genetically modified microorganisms to be taken outside the lab.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)No.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)No.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)No.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)No.In fact, it is unthinkable to release our bacteria in the environment without being confident enough that there won\u0092t be any disturbances of the ecosystems of the Lascaux caves and the surrounding environment.That\u0092s why, to minimize both the risk of dissemination and of gene transfer, several solutions were planned.Thanks to her, we have completed a formation (with the NEO software) to learn the different risks related to our work in the laboratory and how to react in case of danger.We have to obey to the rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (Decree No.- Waste: Different trash containers are available in the lab:- One for biological waste.This room is key-closed and the wearing of a lab coat, gloves and glasses is mandatory.At the end, we had a test to make sure that we comprehended everything.--> Autoclave training: Our team has taken an autoclave training, which showed us the explosive and implosive dangers of the dispositive and the security measures to take in order to protect oneself.- Biological safety cabinet: To work into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms, we have used a biological safety cabinet (FASTER \u0096 Ultrasafe).Their goal is to ensure the well-being of the employees, regarding safety rules and risk prevention.A lab coat, heat resistant gloves and glasses were required for the manipulation of the autoclave.During summer, our team worked in the engineering school INSA, which has a safety department.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5).Therefore, the main threat is the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where gene transfer could occur between microorganisms.In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures.This Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be followed in research laboratories, where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens.The last control was executed on October 25th 2015.A control of maintenance is done each year.These organisms do

grown in a co-culture in BG-11 with 5g/l of acetate.As can be seen in Figure 5, the acetate production alone in JA06 is not enough to sustain a stable growth of Y. lipolytica, but can rather only keep a few cells alive.The JA06 strain showed acetate levels of up to 0.22 g/l when grown in regular BG-11, Figure 2, and up to 0.74 g/l when grown in BG-11 with bicarbonate, Figure 3.Fig 2.OD730 and acetate over time for Synechocystis JA06 in BG-11Fig 3.OD730 and acetate over time for Synechocystis JA06 in BG-11 + NaHCO3Although the JA06 strain already showed some promising numbers for acetate production it was believed that this number could have been increased further with the genetic modifications that were planned for the organism.Although the promoter study was completed, the continued work on S. cerevisiae was put on hold for other tasks that at the time were deemed more important.A growth trial was performed on both the WT and JA06 strains of Synechocystis given to us to study its growth rate, Figure 1, and the acetate production, Figure 2 & Figure 3.This is good since it indicates that the added features of the mutant strain does not put any major metabolic burden on the organism.Fig 1.OD730 over time for Synechocystis wild type and JA06 in BG-11When measuring the samples from the growth trial by using HPLC it was shown that the wild type had no acetate production, as was expected.With some of the modifications that were planned for the organisms it is possible that the acetate production would\u0092ve been enough for a stable growth.None of the planned modifications were however successfully performed as there were major problems with the assembly and transformation of constructs during the project.A growth trial was performed to investigate the ability of the different organisms to naturally grow on acetate in BG-11 media.This was expected based on the growth trials of Y. lipolytica and JA06.Two initial co-cultures were tested using the unmodified JA06 strain of Synechocystis and the WT of Y. lipolytica.As can be seen in Figure 1 the wild type and mutant strain JA06 of Synechocystis followed a very similar growth curve during the 600 hours long growth trial.The organism that was most successfully grown under the desired conditions was Y. lipolytica, Figure 4.Y. lipolytica has been shown to grow on sucrose after adding a gene for sucrose utilization [2].Secondly, for Synechosystis it might be easier and quicker to knock down the expression of targeted genes than knocking them out, since the multiple copies of chromosomes in Synechosystis makes knocking genes out a labor intensive and slow process [3].But with all the issues that were encountered with the construct assemblies and transformations there was not time to get them working.Fig 4.Yarrowia\u0092s OD over time when grown in BG-11 media with 5 g/l acetate.Y.It was thus not possible to carry out many of the desired modifications in the time frame dedicated for the lab work.Which constructs were successfully assembled can be seen in Table 1.Table 1.These were supposed to enable the production organisms for the dependency system of the co-culture and to increase the acetate production of Synechocystis.In one of the co-cultures standard BG-11 media was used, Figure 5, and in the other BG-11 with 5 g/l of acetate was used, Figure 6.It is however

organisms is not quite possible yet.", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "In the case of our cyanobacterium, the limiting substrate in the model is the amino acid produced by the production organism (arginine for E. coli and B. subtilis, and glutamine for S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica), for which Synechocystis is auxotrophic.For that reason, we have only looked at parameters for Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica, the latter being the production organism to have shown the most promise in the lab.Making a parameter estimation for the maximum growth rate was not very difficult for either organism, as we had data from our growth trials.Unfortunately, we ended up not having time to incorporate this last part in the project, but we\u0092d like to direct a big \u0093thank you\u0094 their way for all their help!With this basic model we can study the ratio between Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica that stabilises over time, as can be seen in figure 1.Therefore, after a predictive model is reached, the problem of getting Synechocystis to produce enough acetate for a production organism in co-culture will almost certainly remain a difficult challenge, and one that has to be surmounted when going forward with this project.For this model we have assumed that we will be able to maintain conditions where the amino acid will be the growth-limiting factor.For a substrate-constrained system governed by Monod kinetics, growth can be described with the following equations [1].For the production organism, this is quite realistic, as the only substrate available will be the acetate produced by Synechocystis.The ratio between Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica stabilises over time.Even if the ratio our model returned is not to be taken too seriously, it is not unrealistic that the cyanobacterium should outnumber the production organism, given the premises of the model.Lacking enough time in the lab for this, however, we have elected to make some rough estimations of what these parameters might be, in order to be able to show the model at work.Naturally, this might not be a good approximation, but as we need measurements of our own to get the model to be predictive anyway, this just serves as a first step to see the model in action.At this stage we collaborated with the Manchester iGEM team in order to get help with parameter estimations.Just like in the article, we have not taken cell death into account in this first simple system.The first two rows of equations describe regular substrate-constrained Monod-governed growth, where \u00b5 is the growth rate [1/h], n is the cell density [g DW/L], k is the maximum growth rate [1/h], K is the substrate affinity [mol/L], and c is the concentration of cross-fed metabolite [mol/L].Glutamine requirement for Synechocystis proved harder to find a source for, so we did some back-of-the-envelope calculations based on the approximate percentage of cell dry weight that is proteins, and the percentage of amino acid residues in proteins that is glutamine.Here, ? represents the export rate of a nutrient [mol/(g DW*h)] in the organism that produces it.In a coculture where the organisms are dependent on each other for survival, a mathematical model can be useful to predict the stability of the system under different conditions.The closest thing we could find on arginine export rates in Y. lipolytica was the same information for C. glutamicum [4].While this amino acid is required by the cyanobacterium, it is not guaranteed to always be rate limiting.[5]\u00a0\u00a0 Labarre J, Thuriaux P, Chauvat F. Genetic analysis of amino acid transport in the facultatively heterotrophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.Since no measurements seem to be available for either of the organisms and their limiting substrates, we decided to use the Michaelis-Menten constants for uptake of the relevant substrates as approximations.[1].Our model relies on the assumption that the system is substrate-constrained.Another conceivable limitation is the CO2 used by Synechocystis during photosynthesis, but that should be relatively simple to maintain abundant levels of.? is the required amount of the same nutrient for growth, for the organism that is limited by its availability [mol/g DW].We used MATLAB to solve the differential equations above for two organisms simultaneously, with a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver.Naturally, this provides only a rough estimate.As we got our Synechocystis strain from Josefine Anfelt in Paul Hudson\u0092s group at KTH, information on its acetate export rate was readily available in one of their articles [3].The amount of acetate exported by the cyanobacterium is not very high.Parameter estimations for Synechocystis and Y. lipolyticaFor substrate requirement, we found the biomass yield on acetate for Y. lipolytica [2] and inverted it.The ideal solution would be to perform experiments ourselves to measure export rates and growth requirements of the essential nutrients, as well as substrate affinities.We could only find the desired constant for Synechocystis [5], so we used that value for Y. lipolytica as well.1987;169(10):4668-73.2015;33(10):1061.2004;279(10):9125-38.In the last equation, we look at the change in the extracellular concentration of the respective limiting nutrients.The remaining parameters proved more difficult, since there are of course no papers published on the effects of changes we have made ourselves during the project.While the coding itself did not present any problems, finding the correct values for all parameters turned out to be trickier.", "notebook": "Check out all the protocols we used in the project.Check out how we made lab work easier to follow

the acetate production alone in JA06 is not enough to sustain a stable growth of Y. lipolytica, but can rather only keep a few cells alive.The JA06 strain showed acetate levels of up to 0.22 g/l when grown in regular BG-11, Figure 2, and up to 0.74 g/l when grown in BG-11 with bicarbonate, Figure 3.Fig 2.OD730 and acetate over time for Synechocystis JA06 in BG-11Fig 3.OD730 and acetate over time for Synechocystis JA06 in BG-11 + NaHCO3Although the JA06 strain already showed some promising numbers for acetate production it was believed that this number could have been increased further with the genetic modifications that were planned for the organism.Although the promoter study was completed, the continued work on S. cerevisiae was put on hold for other tasks that at the time were deemed more important.A growth trial was performed on both the WT and JA06 strains of Synechocystis given to us to study its growth rate, Figure 1, and the acetate production, Figure 2 & Figure 3.This is good since it indicates that the added features of the mutant strain does not put any major metabolic burden on the organism.Fig 1.OD730 over time for Synechocystis wild type and JA06 in BG-11When measuring the samples from the growth trial by using HPLC it was shown that the wild type had no acetate production, as was expected.With some of the modifications that were planned for the organisms it is possible that the acetate production would\u0092ve been enough for a stable growth.None of the planned modifications were however successfully performed as there were major problems with the assembly and transformation of constructs during the project.A growth trial was performed to investigate the ability of the different organisms to naturally grow on acetate in BG-11 media.This was expected based on the growth trials of Y. lipolytica and JA06.Two initial co-cultures were tested using the unmodified JA06 strain of Synechocystis and the WT of Y. lipolytica.As can be seen in Figure 1 the wild type and mutant strain JA06 of Synechocystis followed a very similar growth curve during the 600 hours long growth trial.The organism that was most successfully grown under the desired conditions was Y. lipolytica, Figure 4.Y. lipolytica has been shown to grow on sucrose after adding a gene for sucrose utilization [2].Secondly, for Synechosystis it might be easier and quicker to knock down the expression of targeted genes than knocking them out, since the multiple copies of chromosomes in Synechosystis makes knocking genes out a labor intensive and slow process [3].But with

which is resposive to NO-activated norR, allowing us to sense the presence of nitric oxide.Figure 2: DNA- and 3-oxo-C6-HSL bound, dimeric form of TraR, a close homolog of EsaR (PDB: 1L3L, edited with UCSF Chimera11) Our goal is to not only detect a general inflammation biomarker, but also specific molecules secreted by the microbiota, which would allow us to gain insights into microbiome composition.To each vial a different candidate molecule is added.In case one of the bacterial strains has encountered this specific molecule it will \"remember\" (as their plasmids / genomes made an irreversible rearrangement due to recombinases, Cpf1 or Cas9).Cultures which show an a green colour (GFP, positive signal) - additionally to orange (mNectarine, negative control) - have successfully associated intestinal inflammation with the candidate molecule.mNectarine will always be present, as only one or no strain will react to the candidate molecule.The parts we used for our constructs were partially already described and used by former iGEM teams.As our target HSL is not the natural ligand for EsaR, we designed and commenced experiments for the directed evolution of EsaR in order to change its specificity.In order to serve as a diagnostics and research tool, our system should not only be able to sense a single molecule alone but should associate an inflammation marker - in our case NO\u0095 - with a potential trigger of the inflammation itself.EsaR s ligand.In order to change EsaR s specificity towards an IBD related HSL, we try to to apply directed evolution on this repressor protein.The variant of EsaR that we used was already an improved version with a D91G mutation that has an increased signal sensitivity compared to the wildtype16.A dual selection system offers a possibility to select for these variants.This way, mNectarine is removed and GFP is expressed.In a final system, the gfp gene would be under the control of a constitutive promoter regulated by an esaBox, the binding site of EsaR.These will then be ligated by endogeneous ligases via NHEJ which reconstitutes the GFP gene.In a final system, the gfp gene would be under the control of a constitutive promoter regulated by an esaBox, the binding site of EsaR.These systems allow for negative selection (\"killing\") of variants that still react to the native HSL (3-oxo-C6-HSL) and positive selection (\"survival\") of variants that respond to the new target HSL (3-OH-C6-HSL).Variants whose expression is still induced by the old HSL or which have a non-functional repressor (EsaR) express the fusion protein which converts the toxin precursor into a toxin (A), whereas non-responsive repressors remain bound to the DNA and inhibit protein expression (B).Only when NO\u0095 is present it activates the transcription of the gene under control of the norVW promoter (adapted from Green et al.)Pavlov\u0092s Coli holds promise as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, potentially able to shed light on microbiome imbalances associated with IBD.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterised by chronic inflammation of parts of the intestine.While Pavlov s Coli travels through the gut, simultaneous detection of IBD markers activate an AND gate which triggers a unidirectional switch, thus committing the observation to memory.\"Role of the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: what have we learnt in the past 10 years.\"Additionally, the authors present their system as a rapid detection strategy for diagnosing IBD related disease flare-ups, which would allow for immediate intervention.It is suggested that this is advantageous for genome editing via non-homologous end-joining15.Cpf1 is potentially capable of creating an AND-gate controlled one-way switch with finally the same functionality as the recombinase-based switch.For this, a reporter construct needs to be stably integrated into the genome of E. coli whereas Cpf1 and its guide RNAs are expressed from a plasmid.In our test system, the ?-Red system, which is necessary for recombination, is induced by a heat shock but would finally be under the same regulation as Cas9.Thus, it is curcial to understand how the read-out of our system works, once the reporter strains are recovered from a patient.\"Nitric oxide and the gastrointestinal tract.\"\"Role of the intestinal barrier in inflammatory bowel disease.\"Afterwards, the variants can be plated and analyzed or subjected to further rounds of positive / negative selection to enrich for suitable variants.The idea to administer genetically modified bacteria in the context of IBD was put forward by Steidler et al.\"Manipulation of the quorum sensing signal AI-2 affects the antibiotic-treated gut microbiota.\"At an inflammation spot, nitric oxide activates NorR and triggers the transcription of the bxb1 integrase gene.EsaR s ligand, is encountered again.An alternative to a recombinase-based switch is the usage of the 2015 characterised CRISPR/Cpf1 system14.The repair mechanism by the ?-Red system is - in our test system - manually induced by a heat shock which then recombines the gfp gene via the two homology arms.HSL makes the repressor EsaR dissociate from the regulatory element (esaBox) on the DNA and thus annihiliates its roadblock activity.Once the bxb1 gene is successfully transcribed and translated, Bxb1 binds to the attP and attB recombination sites flanking a constitutive promoter and inverts it.In a second step, these variants now undergo a round of positive selection to select for variants that are responsive to the new HSL 3-OH-C6-HSL.The special feature of EsaR is its regulatory behaviour: while most HSL-responsive elements are inducible activators, EsaR is a repressor that dissociates from the DNA in the presence of HSL.The constitutive promoter, which is now placed upstream of the reporter protein GFP, is additionally under the control of another esaBox, the binding site of EsaR.\"Directed evolution of the quorum-sensing regulator EsaR for increased signal sensitivity.\"IBD is not only a severe burden for the patients, but it also causes increasing direct and indirect costs for society.Moreover, we extended our single AND-gate by the addition of a memory module: AND-gate activation results in the activation of a unidirectinal switching mechanism, which in turn renders a reporter protein (e.g.GFP) sensitive to a bio-marker previuosly encountered by the AND-gate (e.g.The diagnosis is mostly based on the location of inflammation observed during a colonoscopy.The addition of a candidate biomarker to the bacteria isolated from the patient s faeces induces the expression of a fluorescent protein, if this biomarker has been memorized.After the system has now learned to respond to the associated stimulus alone, the expression of GFP could easily be induced by just exposing it to the stimulus again, e.g.After the system has now learned to respond to the associated stimulus alone, the expression of GFP could easily be induced by just exposing it to the stimulus again, e.g.The HSL makes the repressor EsaR dissociate from the regulatory element (esaBox) on the DNA and thus annihiliates its roadblock activity.The HSL makes the repressor EsaR dissociate from the regulatory element (esaBox) on the DNA and thus annihiliates its roadblock activity.One well-known class of molecules secreted by many bacterial species belongs to the quorum sensing (QS) system.As the gastrointestinal tract is a rough environment for non-adapted (probiotic) bacteria, we envision our bacteria to be encapsulated in a hydrogel-coated pill.One of the AHLs that has been found to be upregulated in IBD is 3-hydroxy-hexanoyl-HSL (3-OH-C6-HSL)13.We tested the combination of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT)17.This irreversibly blocks the thymidylate synthase (thyA), a key enzyme in the production of pyrimidine nucleosides in the cell, which finally leads to cell death18.In a first step, the created library of variants is grown in the presence of the old inducer 3-oxo-C6-HSL and a toxin precursor.Furthermore, the expression of mNectarine / GFP would be under control of the candidate molecule (e.g.Beside the penetration of immunogenic antigens across the epithelial layer, there is also abnormal leakage of inflammation markers into the gut lumen.The guide RNA is expressed constitutively at a high level.Once Cas9 is expressed, it is brought to the cleavage-site by the the guide RNA.The guide RNAs are expressed constitutively at a high level.Once Cfp1 is expressed, it is brought to the cleavage-sites by the two distinct guide RNAs.Contrary to the CRISPR/Cpf1 system, the Cas9 endonuclease cuts the genome integrated reporter construct only once and the double strand breake (DSB) is sealed by homology directed repair.Generally, the use of engineered probiotic bacteria as a delivery vector for in vivo produced therapeutic agents has been described multiple times.A TOOL FOR DIAGNOSING IBD BASED ON ASSOCIATIVE LEARNINGThe ETH Zurich iGEM team 2016 will focus on the diagnostic monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease.Our Pavlov s Coli learn the occurence of the presence of two markers and store this information in their DNA until readout.Now that the system has learned to respond to the associated stimulus, namely the AHL alone, the expression of GFP is induced whenever the stimulus, i.e.Thus, we implemented an associative learning circuit that allows for the detection of the temporal and spatial presence of two markers.Furthermore, only in Europe 2.5 million people are affected by IBD and the number of cases is increasing world-wide1.Unfortunately there are no characteristic blood markers to distinguish between the different forms of IBD.Hexameric NorR is constitutively bound upstream of the norVW promoter, but in the absence of NO\u0095 its AAA+ domain is blocked.In the absence of NO\u0095, this domain is blocked and transcription initiation is prevented.Yet, the transcription can proceed only if OH-C6-HSL is also present.The diversity of the microbiota is noticeably reduced3,4 in IBD patients and the composition of the gut flora changes from symbiotic to predominantly pathobiotic microbes5.The procedure to easily figure out if a specific candidate molecule has been associated with inflammation is the following: The recovered bacteria-containing capsules are split into different vials.This cell layer separates the gut lumen containing trillions of microbes from the body.These are BxB1 recombinase, tp901 and the pNorV promoter.There, Cfp1 cuts out the mNectarine gene while creating sticky ends.This would protect the bacteria and ensure the recovery of the reporter strain.The best known subclass of QS molecules are the N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL).\"Engineered E. coli that detect and respond to gut inflammation through nitric oxide sensing.\"While the number of distinguistable reporters (e.g.If the reporter strains encounter the inflammation-associated marker again, they generate an easily observable output: fluorescence.While CAT confers resistance for the positive selection step, UPRT is necessary for the negative selection.Inflammation partially disrupts the integrity of the layer of epithelial cells lining the intestine.ATP hydrolysis by the AAA+ domain of NorR provides the necessary energy for the open complex formation involving the DNA and the RNA-polymerase holoenzyme.The damage to this essential barrier compromises its selectivity and allows for penetration of immunogenic antigens from the lumen across the epithelial layer6,7 which enhances the inflammation reaction.Also the underlying trigger of the disease is not completely understood but correlation studies proposed factors such as diet, genetic predisposition, breach of the intestinal barrier and unfavorable alteration of the microbiota, called dysbiosis2.The term describes an ensemble of conditions, the most common of which are ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease.A community of sensor cells with different sensing specificities can be utilized at the same time, enabling a high degree of multiplexing.Instead of cutting both DNA strands at the same position, Cpf1 cuts the DNA with an offset of four or five nucleotides, thus producing single-stranded overhangs.The bacteria are cultured in medium containing the new HSL and the antibiotic whose resistance is part of the fusionprotein.\"Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease of a class 2 CRISPR-Cas system.\"This was achieved by integrating a second AND-gate that relies on the successful learning process as shown below.This work provides us with the relevant genetic elements and helps us to design a sensor for our purpose.At a site of inflammation, nitric oxide activates NorR and triggers the transcription of

system would not be feasible in clinical trials.This would pose a safety hazard to the patient ingesting our bacteria, next to falsifying our measurment of our inflammation marker, nitric oxide.In a conversation with Prof. Lacroix we discussed the role of certain molecules in IBD pathogenesis.We decided that for our purposes, the bacterial metabolite lactate would be the best alternative to sense microbiome markers.The interesting part behind lactate is that, currently it is not possible to measure lactate levels in the gut through fecal samples.", "modeling": "We developed a hybrid deterministic-stochastic model of our system covering the mechanics of the components we use.The estiamtion of the parameters uses INSIGHT, a recent method based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and flow cytomerty data.1Identify at least one parameter set for which the system shows the desired behavior.Predict qualitatively the response of the system to different inputs.Assist design of the system by comparing the qualitative behavior of different design alternatives.Tune the system for the desired time scale and concentration ranges.Develop a detailed model capturing the kinetics of our integrase-based switch.We started modeling the system already during the design phase, allowing us to provide a quick proof of concept of the proposed curcuits.The main goals include a model-aided design of the system, tuning of the system components for our application and prediction of the system behavior.The model matches the modular sructure of the system, making easier to exchange components and test their behavior in the full system.We designed and constructed the system under awareness of those critical points.Since our application targets specific time and concentration ranges we used the model to tune the components of the system.Right: The range of parameters for the switch that allows the system to memorize events correctly.Based on the known mechanics of integrases we developed a novel stochastic model for integrases capturing the mechanics of the switching process.We identified tunable key parameters using sensitivity analysis and determined optimal parameter ranges: simulations guided us to adjust the sensitivity of our sensors to the physiological concentration ranges (see tuning of the nitric oxide sensor, tuning of the AHL sensor, tuning of the lactate sensor) and to optimize the switch for the expected timescale (see tuning of the switch).Check our module pages to learn about our results in detail!Figure 1: Schematic view of the model structure.After recovery of the pill, the system is exposed to AHL again and expresses GFP if NO and AHL were detected.Thanks to qualitative simulations of the system during the design phase, we managed to get early information about the behavior of the the system.Each module represents a circuit element.Due to the complexity of our system, an intuitive design would not be sufficient.With this feature we were able to quickly test alternative parts like the lactate sensor, that was introduced later during development.The parameters of the model are strictly based on literature or experimental characterization of the single components.During transit in the gut the system is exposed to the inflammation marker (NO) and the candidate marker (species-specific AHL).After recovery of the pill, the system is exposed to the candidate marker (AHL) again and since AHL was associated with an inflammation marker, GFP is expressed again.Figure 2: Simulation of the full system.Several components must be tuned specifically for our application, and the correct functioning of the candidate designs is not obvious.Moreover, we were able to identify potential problems (like leakiness and sensitivity) and predict their influence on the final system.We planned to use the stochastic model for estimating the parameters of the model using the INSIGHT tool.Figure 2 shows the functioning of the full system: Pavlov s Coli is encpsulated in a pill and is ingested by the patient.Once NO and AHL are detected at the same time, our memory element start switching.The sensor module was tuned for the relevant concentrations of quorum sensing molecule and the switch kinetics were adapted for the expected time scale of the measurements.Figure 3: Left: Functional regions of the parameter space satisfying the requirements of our application.In particular the model advised us on the design of the the position of the integrase gene.", "notebook": "We created fragment with RBS+EsaR from addgene

did PCR to create fragments with mNectarine inside sfGFP with homology flanks to three different regions on chromosome:We did a PCR to create fragments with separate mNectarine and sfGFP genes with homology flanks to the same regions on the chromosome.-We attempted to insert fragments onto a chromosome: oinoculation of fluorescent cells in the LB medium overnightWe created fragments, did Gibson assembly and colony PCR to create parts with bxb1 recombinase with different ssRa tags under AND gate promoter.Restriction overnight (8 hours) worked.We did site directed mutagenesis (PCR) to add ssRa tag to mNectarine and sfGFP.Directed evolution: make EsaR specific to AHL present in the gutWe prepared electro-competent DH5alpha -uptr cells.We transformed respective cells with plasmid with uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (upp or uptr).We performed Tecan plate reader experiment to test the response of cells with and without the plasmid towards 5-fluorouracil.Samples where norR was not present in the cell also got induced when the DETA/NO was addedFigure 1: Activation of pNorv promoter shows a very low induction in comparison to the positive controlIn the plate reader experiments we did a time and dose response curve for strains with pNorV and norR plasmid and with pNorV and empty backbone.We prepared Keio competent cells of parent strain and of norR knockout strain (40 transformations) and transformed pNorV plasmid into Keio strains.Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidsFigure 1: EsaR can effectively repress gene expression.Figure 1: Using presence or absence of EsaR we can observe and gate behavior in the current design of the AND gate promoter.However, since the cells grew, they were Amp resistant.We transformed additional pSEVA empty backbone plasmids.We did PCR to linearize pSEVA backbones and to get fragments with prefix + J23118 and terminator + suffix for Gibson assemblies.We did digestion to exchange oris on two plasmid backbones.Following all successful transformations we did overnight culture and minipreps.We performed a Gibson assembly to create a norR plasmid with J23118 promoter and T0 terminator.We did PCR to create fragments with overhangs for Gibson assembly for parts containing recombinases phiC3, bxb1 and tp901, with attB site in front of recombinase and attP site after terminator.After transformations of plasmids created with GA or site directed mutagenesis, colonies were picked in the evening for overnight culture and miniprep was done the next day in the morning.We did PCR to add overlaps to norR fragment and repeat Gibson assemblt for norRWe did Gibson assembly of pNorV + sfGFP plasmid.Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidsWe performed plate reader experiments to test and compare all variations of the designed esabox promoters.Figure 1: Image shows a dose response for a promoter with only one esabox.Figure 1: Image shows a dose response for a promoters with three esaboxes.Figure 1: Image the effect of the size of the spacer (8bp or 15bp) in the promoters with 3 esaboxes.Results from the plate reader experiments showed that the AND gate is not working yet.We did site directed mutagenesis to fix the mutation in norR from the gBlock.Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidsWe attempted to replace J23118 promoter in esaR plasmid with J23114 promoter.Figure 1: Dose response of the promoter with one esabox with wider AHL concentration range with and without esaR plasmidFigure 1: Dose response of the promoter with two esaboxes with wider AHL concentration range with and without esaR plasmidFigure 1: Dose response of the promoter with three esaboxes with wider AHL concentration range with and without esaR plasmidFigure 1: Dose response comparison of designs with different sizes of spacers for three esaboxes Plate reader experiments show that in comparison with the positive control, strains with esaR plasmid have lower fluorescence.We performed PCR of all fragments related to the test in order to construct:We did a Gibson assembly of plasmid with mNectarine inside sfGFP and plasmid with mNectarine and sfGFP.Inactive (dead) cells present were in the measurements because overnight culture reached stationary phase and a portion of population of the cells was dead.We created fragments for Gibson assembly and Gibson assembly of plasmid with mNectarine and gRNA recognition sites inside sfGFP gene.We performed a restriction and ligation to create hybrid promoters for the AND gate: We created 10 different combinations of promoters:We did colony PCR and sequencing of plasmids with recombinases under tet promoter.The cells contained three plasmids: the EsaR plasmid, the plasmid containing AND gate promoter with recombinase gene downstream and the plasmid containing sfgfp under promoter flanked with bxb1 recognition sites.We prepared stock of competent cells (480 transformations).Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidsWe created a plasmid with two copies of esaR to increase the amount of EsaR in the cells.Based on the plate reader experiment and on sequencing results which show deletion in norR we concluded the NorR from our plasmid is not responsible for the activation of transcription and the dose response we observe.Followed were first overnight cultures of transformations and first minipreps of the plasmids from transformations and addgene colonies.We prepared first batch of ingredients for M9 media.We poured first LB-agar plates with single resistances for carbenicillin, kanamycin and chloramphenicol.We used two approaches to get norR and pNorV fragments: Comment: Genomic PCR was not successful because we added too much bacterial culture.The design shown up most left showed the best AND gate logic behavior.Figure 1: Dose response for the newly designed AND gateFigure 1: Dose response for the newly designed AND gate with and without EsaRWe did a resistance exchange on LldR plasmid from iGEM team ETH Zurich 2015 and a double transformation of hybrid promoters pNorV + lactate and LldR.Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmids We created a plasmid with KpnI site between J23118 promoter and sfGFP to enable addition of esaboxes with restriction and ligation.We did PCR to create fragments without attP and attB sites next to recombinases and performed Gibson assembly of the new design for the recombinases.We made a hypothesis that NorR from a genomic copy of norR is binding to the pNorV promoter on our plasmid.The results show the potential for an AND gate behaviour after future optimizationWe did PCR for basic parts, restriction and ligation of composite parts, transformations, minipreps and sequencing of all biobrick parts.We did triple transformations with the full system and did preliminary studies to test how all parts work togetherWe repeated the plate reader experiments.We changed the original design into a three plasmid system and we redesigned plasmids and order oligos.We did colony PCR and sent to sequencing pNorV+sfGFP plasmidsWe did site directed mutagenesis to add moderate ssRa tag to sfGFP in a plasmid with pNorV+sfGFP.As a source of nitric oxide (NO) we used DETANO.Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidsWe performed restriction and ligation to create a low copy plasmid version of esaR plasmid.We received a plasmid with bxb1 recombinase from Bonnet lab.We performed plate reader with low copy number plasmid versions of pNorV+sfGFP and norR plasmids:Figure 1: PnorV dose response curve for a very low range of DETA/NO concentrations.Colony PCR of Gibson assembly from the previous week did not show any positive results.From previous experiments we made a hypothesis that the native norR on the chromosome might be enough for the activation of our pNorV promoter.Sequencing showed construction of mNectarine and mNectarine + ssRa tag under ptet promoter was successful.Results from this experiment show we get an induction of pNorV when the DETANO is present in the medium with or without norR plasmid.However, sequencing showed the two sites were not completely integrated.We made plasmid with promoter and 3 esaboxes with 8bp spacers ready for insertion of dual selectorsWe did a plate reader experiment to test CAT-UPRT fusion with 5-FU.We prepared isothermal reaction buffer solutions and ITA/Gibson assembly mix.Figure 1: Testing of the maximum activation of pNorVFigure 1: Dose response of pNorV using endogenous copy of NorRWe started with experiments to confirm the hypothesis that pNorV can be activated with genomic copy of norR.It was not repeated after we successfully multiplied norR from gBlock.Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidWe did PCR to get a fragment with esaR from addgene plasmid and added overhangs to it.We repeated Gibson assembly for plasmids with recombinases under tet promoter.We did Gibson assembly of plasmid with esaR and norR on a low copy plasmid.Results imply an AND gate logic of the hybrid promoter.Figure 8: The 2D dose response for the lactate and DETA/NO show that the hybrid promoter exhibits an AND logic behavior.We run the preliminary experiments, where we tested whether the gRNA can effectively excise mNectarine gene inserted in the sfgfp gene.Most importantly, get a dose response even when norR plasmid is not present in the cell.two versions of pNorV: one with the native spacer after transcription start site and one withoutTest 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidWe ordered gBlocks for promoters with esaboxes.Addition of ssRa tag was not successful.We did first double transformations of pNorV+sfGFP and norR plasmids with additional double transformations of pNorV + empty backbone as a control.We did a plate reader experiment.Following was Gibson assembly of mutated variants.We did the first attempt at selection: After transformation of Gibson assembly of mutated variants of esaR, a portion was plated on plates and the rest was inoculated in LB.We picked the red colonies from the two plasmids where mNectarine is inside sfGFP gene and where it is separately on the same plasmid as sfGFP.Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidsAttempt to construct low copy plasmid with esaR under very weak promoter (J23102).We designed, created fragments and did a Gibson assembly to create variations of recombinases with no ssRa tag and with stronger ssRa tag.Figure 7: FACS experiments show improved dynamics of bxb1 upon changing the RBS.This implies esaR is not released from the promoter.In the last plasmid, the promoter was initially facing the opposite direction of sfgfp.We transform plasmid from the distribution kit with ptet promoter.Followed we did PCR to create fragment with insert pNorV+sfGFP to put it in a different backbone.Test 1B: Construction of promoters with esaboxes and esaR plasmidsWe multiplied with PCR fragmets from gBlocks of promoters with esaboxes.The difference between the fluorescence of positive control and pNorV plasmid strains additionally supports our assumption.We additionallt decide to increase the promoter strength of esaR.We did Gibson assembly of reporter construct for bxb1 and tp901 recombinases.We performed site directed mutagenesis to insert LldO2 site after pNorV promoter.We observed the increase of GFP fluorescence upon induction of Cpf1Figure 9: The dose response show that Cpf1 can excise mNectarine from sfgfp.The designed different in the location of the esaboxes (and whether the location caused steric or competitive inhibition of the pNorV promoter), the number of esaboxes and in the size of spacing between the esaboxes.We did site directed mutagenesis (PCR) to insert LldO1 site upstream of pNorV.We transformed all interlab study test plasmids and did plate reader and FACS experiment.Ori exchange in plasmid did not work with restriction, we tried a new approach with two part Gibson assembly.We were experiencing problem with gel cleanup, which often yielded impure fragments.The next day we prepared the first batch of competent TOP10 cells (80 transformations).plasmids from distribution kit to get J23118 promoter, terminator, prefix and suffixTransformation of plasmids with fluorescent proteins we might use: sfGFP, mCherry, mNectarine, mTurqouise.Adding ssRa tag to sfGFP was not successful.We did PCR of fragments for construction of hsvTK-GFP with overlaps to esaboxes.We were finally able to start putting our biobrick parts into the shipping plasmid backbone.We 3D printed a stand with magnetic beads for purification of gel extractions with magnetic beadsWe repeated Gibson assembly to create two versions of pNorV + sfGFP plasmids.We made a hypothesis that those are dead cells because overnight culture reached stationary phase.We did plate reader experiments to determine time and dose response points for sfGFP for FACS measurements.We did FACS measurements of sfGFP with induction with aTc.Impurities from the fragment might inhibit Gibson assembly reactions.Directed evolution of esaR was put on hold until we built promoters with esaboxes.Double transformation of esaR plasmid and plasmid with esaboxes and sfGFPResistance exchange for plasmid with promoter+esaboxes to Tet resistance and for plasmid with esaR to Amp resistance.Plasmids with ampicilin resistance grow poorly on carbenicilin plates.We created our Part Collection from the old and new AND gate designs.Figure 3: Image shows examples of different hybrid promoters we constructed.We performed PCR to create fragments for Gibson assembly of reporter constructs for recombinases.When the OD reached 0.5 the cells were not able to grow further in the next 12 hours.In promoters with multiple esaboxes, the promoter with 8 base pair spacer is more effectively repressed in comparison to the promoter where there is 15 base pair spacer in between esaboxes.There was no growth difference between un-induced and induced stateWe did PCR to get fragments with CAT (chloramphenicol resitance) and UPTR.We did Gibson asesembly of CAT and UPTR fragments to create fusion protein.We attempted to construct hsvTK (herpes simplex virus thimidine kinase)-APH-Stop-GFP operon:We did PCR to create APH and hsvTK fragments and performed Gibson assembly.We did an ori exchange to create low copy plasmid with norR.Results from model simulations show that the design where recombinase is not embedded between the recombinase recognition sites is better.plate reader and FACS results show the two versions of recombinases (bxb1 and tp901, both with moderate ssRa tag) we have either work too efficiently (p901) or not enough (bxb1).We got several positive colony PCRs.We did a Gibson assembly with a gBlock corrected with site directed mutagenesis.The two repressors have been shown to not be fully functional or not respond to the current dose responses.When tetracycline induces expression of Cpf1, we observe green fluorescence.We ran the full system with an AHL+NO AND gate together with the improved bxb1 recombinase.Due to small amount of DETANO remaining in the lab we were only able to use concentrations in the lower range of the dose response.Figure 10: The output of the full system resembles an AND gate behavior upon induction.We did transformations of sfGFP + ssRa and mNectarine + ssRa plasmids created a week before.Hypothesis that 5-FU is more toxic to cells in stationary phase.We did a second attempt to create composite parts for biobricks based on iGEM protocol.Experiments showed that plasmid-containing cells are much more sensitive to 5-FU than DH5a cells without the plasmid.5-FU was added to the culture after one hour.We did plate reader experiments to determine time and dose response points for mNectarine for FACS measurements.We did FACS measurements of mNectarine with induction with aTc.We ordered gBlocks for 3 different codon optimized recombinases without forbidden restriction sites:We prepared first TFB1 and TFB2 buffers for competent cells.After discovering LB medium requires 10x more 5-FU than M9 medium, the attempt at selection was cancelled.We did a Gibson assembly of plasmids with gRNA, cas9 and cpf1.After that, we added esaboxes behind J23118 promoter using restriction and ligation.In red we see the switch dynamics of bxb1 before the change of RBS.", "protocol": "", "result": "In blue we see the improved switch dynamics of bxb1.We were able to construct reporters for recombinases with which we were also able to show the differences in dynamics of recombinases when different degradation tags were added.Another important aspect of our idea is that by implementing associative learning in the circuit, we are provided with the flexibility to detect several different markers.We were able to observe what is the effect of spacers and number of esaboxes on the behavior of the promoters.When we started with testing phase of our esabox promoters we observed that while we can successfully repress transcription with our EsaR repressor, we cannot successfully release the repressor from the promoter.But we are a stubborn bunch of people, so let us present how we pulled back and got as far as we did.This section provides insight into the wet lab part of our project and shows the results we got from the experiments in more detail.There was no induction of pNorV in the norR knock-out strainHowever, we were able to prove that a genomic copy of norR is sufficient for an induction of pNorVDuring our brainstorming sessions in the months before \"hitting the lab\" we put special focus on trying to find a system for an AHL sensor which would be based on a repressor rather than activator.That way we were easily able to find and troubleshoot the issues we encountered during our project.Construction and testing of the nitric oxide sensorConstruction, testing and improving of the recombinasesConstruction and testing of the lactate+NO AND gateOur initial design was focused on building a nitric oxide sensor which consists of a nitric oxide responsive promoter (pNorV) and the corresponding regulator NorR.In comparison to the positive control, we did not achieve to flip majority of promoters, however, the level of flipped promoters was much higher after the change of RBS.Figure 7: FACS experiments show improved dynamics of bxb1 upon changing the RBS.However, we were able to show that the dual selector system is a suitable selection tool if the repressor is strong enough.Samples where norR was not present in the cell also got induced when the DETA/NO was addedFigure 2: Figure shows that we are able to get an induction of pNorV in the wild type Keio strain where genomic copy of norR gene was present.We transformed a recombinase under Tet promoter together with a plasmid containing promoter J23118 flanked with bxb1 binding sites, flipped in the opposite direction of sfgfp.The positive control was a cell containing sfGFP with promoter J23118 facing the direction of the gene.We chose the AND gate design with the best AND gate logic behavior and use it in the construction of the full circuit.Figure 3: Image shows examples of different hybrid promoters we constructed.In our project we studied dynamics of two different recombinases, bxb1 and tp901 by creating reporters for the respective recombinases and perform rigorous experiment about their dynamics.We were able to show the flipping rates for different recombinases and attempted to improve them.Figure 5: Image shows the flipping rate of the bxb1 before the improved RBS.We saw a potential to create many different combinations of hybrid promoters by placing esaboxes on different places and in different numbers to the promoter region.We to demonstrate multiplexing, constructed a lactate + NO AND gate.Figure 8: The 2D dose response for the lactate and DETA/NO show that the hybrid promoter exhibits an AND logic behavior.The hybrid promoter shows an AND gate behavior.In the system, Cpf1 would replace the recombinase downstram of the AND gate promoter.That means that after we already spent a month in the lab designing and building our system,they provided us with important simulations of our system and offered a novel design which we immediately started to build.This lead us to hypothesize that a genomic version of norR is responsible for the activation our promoter.We observed that the output of our system resembled the AND gate logic.However, in comparison to the positive control, we did not achieve to flip majority of promoters.The designed different in the location of the esaboxes (and whether the location caused steric or competitive inhibition of the pNorV promoter), the number of esaboxes and in the size of spacing between the esaboxes.After induction, we were able to see a dose response, where we observe more green fluorescence if more tetracyclin was added to the media.In total we created almost 20 different promoters just by varying the location and number of esaboxes in the promoter region.Figure 10: The output of the full system resembles an AND gate behavior upon induction.Figure shows a 2D dose response of the promoter with respect to the doses NO and AHL.Due to this, it is not suitable to undergo a negative selection process with 5-fluorouracil.At the very end of the project, in the last week before the giant jamboree we were able to construct and test the full system.However, due to the low fold change (1.5), the design needs to be improved in the future.We created an alternative switch, which is not based on recombinases but on Cpf1.Upon actvation of the AND gate, Cpf1 would excise mNectarine from the sfgfp.In our project, the interaction between theory and experiments has been important since the beginning in the construction a recombinase based switch.Figure 9: The dose response show that Cpf1 can excise mNectarine from sfgfp.In red we see the switch dynamics of bxb1 before the change of RBS.After overnight exposure to the inducer tetracyclin, we observed a 7-fold change in the flourescence.After overnight exposure to the inducer, we observed a 30-fold change in the flourescence.We studied properties of three versions with different degradation tags for each of the recombinases.In the scope of our project we tried to demonstrate that there is potential to expand markers to other metabolites, which are considered important in IBD.On the other hand, modelers needed rigorous experimental data to be able to characterize recombinases and their dynamics.five different promoters with different combinations of esaboxes as roadblocksEsaR repressor which can get released from promoter upon induction We were able to build a library of over 10 different hybrid promoters for an AND gate.However, further experiments are required to improve the fold change and behavior of the circuit.Figure 6: Image shows the flipping rate of the bxb1 after improving the RBS.The design shown up most left showed the best AND gate logic behavior.Figure 4: The design with the best AND gate logic (up most left in the previous figure) was characterized further.However, due to the strong secondary structure and repetitive sequences, esaboxes proved to be a challenge to create.Whereas cells expressing the fusion protein are resistant against chloramphenicol, the are especially sensitive towards 5-fluorouracil.The cells lacking the plasmid as well as do not have a chromosomal copy of upp are less inhibited but are sensitive towards chloramphenicol.Middle: GFP-plasmid under control of EsaBox, co-transformed with EsaR plasmidRight: GFP-plasmid under control of EsaBox, no repressorFACS-plots show clearly that EsaR is leaky.One example of such metabolite is lactate, which is a product of microbial metabolism and which also gets utilized by many species of bacteria in the gut.The response of the dual selector plasmid containing a CAT-UPRT fusion protein (CAT: chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, UPRT: uracil phosphoribosyltransferase) towards 5-fluorouracil was tested.When tetracycline induces expression of Cpf1, we observe green fluorescence.We used directed evolution to try and evolve EsaR to change specificity to a different AHL.We transformed the cells with three plasmids:plasmid with AHL + NO AND gate with bxb1 recombinase downstreamplasmid with J23118 promoter flanked with bxb1 recognition sites and sfgfp downstream We induced the cells with AHL and NO.Our fellow iGEM colleagues will surely agree with us when we say that our precious bacteria are very stubborn and mischievous and that they don t always want to behave like we would want them to.", "safety": "Another option would be to use metabolic complementation instead of The capsule would lower the risk of release in the environment by isolating the bacteria from our device from the environment.The device in our final design would consist of bacteria encapsulated in a material (chitosan or alginate) which does not dissolve in the stomach or in the gut, but would allow exchange of small molecule signals.Since the capsule can be broken or damaged, we would additionally have to develop a knock-out strain which would rely on a metabolite abundantly present in the gut but not in the environment.There are several safety risks which we need to consider in the design The strains of E. coli we use have a low, but not non-existent, virulence.We took extra precaution in handling experiments where we used DETA/NO or The final goal of our project is to design a bacteria-based detection system to simultaneously detect compounds associated with inflammation and microbiota in the gut of an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient.We would use a capsule to prevent interaction between our designed bacteria and the native microbiota.We were instructed how to properly label hazardous chemicals and how to act in the case we encounter unfamiliar or unlabeled chemical.This would isolate the bacteria in the device from the gut microbiota.We got acquainted with the specifics of waste management in this building: the location of clean room, how to properly transport chemicals from one part of the building to another, how to prevent potential spread of chemicals from our lab to other areas of the building.Thus we have no intention to release bacteria with our current design in the environment or to consume it.We were taught how to properly maintain a clean lab space and how to correctly store chemicals in the lab to prevent accidents.The goal of our project in the scope of iGEM until the giant jamboree is to design and show that our system works under controlled experimental conditions in the laboratory which would mimic real life conditions.We were instructed who to call in the case of fire and how to act and who to call in the case of an injury.Food and drinks are not allowed in the lab.In the case of a small fire, the fire blanket is used.In the case of a bigger fire, the CO2 fire extinguisher is used.However, we are working with GMO strains which cannot be released into the environment and low risk does not equal zero risk.For this reason we stick to all safety regulations for biosafety level 1 laboratory, such as wearing and frequently changing gloves, wearing lab coat and disinfecting the working area after the experiment.Our bacteria will travel through the human digestive system in a capsule.The encapsulated bacteria will be collected from the feces and will be analyzed in the lab.During the Safety Course we first covered basic safety measurements required for both office and lab members of the department.Chemicals need to be transported in the chemical bucket.In the case where we encounter unknown chemical in solid form we use a brush to gently remove the chemical and dispose it in hazardous waste.When transferring chemicals from one floor to another, they are not allowed in the personel elevator.This requires ingestion of our device by the patient.Additionally the experimenter needs to wear a lab coat, gloves and wear goggles on the top of the head.If the chemicals require handling in gloves, the experimenter must use one hand without a glove to interact with the surroundings (opening doors etc) and one hand with a glove to carry the chemicals.The experimenter must send the chemical separately in the elevator for chemicals, while the experimenter uses the personel elevator.Biosafety level 1 organisms pose little risk to the researcher and the environment.All waste that has been in contact with the bacteria is autoclaved.They are designed to protect the experimenter, the project, the public and the environment.They are all derivatives of K12 E. coli strain and belong to the biosafety level 1.The course is held by Mr. Niels Buerckert, who is the Technical Manager and head of the department\u0092s Safety Committee.To mimic conditions in

computer must have some Java package already installed in order to use the program.Using the DNA designed above and ordered from our gracious sponsor, Integrated DNA Technologies, we proceeded to clone the three HZS genes into the standard BioBrick vector, pSB1C3, through routine restriction enzyme digestion and ligation.Our strategy for this initial step and subsequent cloning steps was to take advantage of the standard BioBrick restriction sites, EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI.In summary, this strategy uses a triple digest and takes advantage of the fact that most commercial spin columns do not capture small fragments like the EcoRI-XbaI fragment, which would have interfered with the ligation if not removed (however, gel purification is not necessary here).We also developed a strategy to use Gibson Assembly, both to clone individual HZS subunits fused to a reporter gene and to generate a three-protein operon that will produce the entire protein.Furthermore, the program will eliminate any of the standard BioBrick restriction sites from the DNA sequence (i.e.DNA was designed from K. stuttgarteinsis protein sequences corresponding to the gamma, beta, and alpha subunits of

doubling of waste entering NZ\u0092s landfills within ten years), the NZ councils have enacted a zero-waste policy; to progressively achieve zero-waste status by 2040.Our team\u0092s aim was to aid this policy (as well as the global plastic plague) by producing a strain of E. coli that produces enzymes which degrade PET.The bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis uses two enzymes to break PET down into Terephthatlic Acid (TPA) and Ethylene Glycol (EG): PETase and MHETase respectively (Yoshida et al., 2016).An initial introductory skype session allowed us to meet, give one another a run down on our respective projects, and to figure out how we might be able to assist each other.We found that the best way the UoA iGEM team could help the Sydney team would be to liaise with large New Zealand horticulture companies on their behalf.Members of iGEM UoA were also able to fill out a survey provided by the iGEM Sydney, and distribute this survey to other people in order to assist them in their data collection.To help us at iGEM UoA, the team at the University of Sydney provided their laboratory protocols for His-Tag purification and IPTG Induction.The NTCU Formosa team kindly presented their work to us, as well as sharing details of their past iGEM projects and meet-ups, to give us more of an idea how the iGEM competition works.Doi: 10.1126/science.aad6359As a student-led start-up team we decided to approach the Taiwanese teams NTCU and NYMU, who had gone through multiple rounds of iGEM competitions in the past years, to receive some tips and tricks of the competition process and team system development.Both teams in Taiwan are working on pesticides that are targeted to a specific agricultural epidemic that has caused great loss in Taiwanese farmlands.This is discovery will assist with both teams sustainability in iGEM competition in the future to come.In true ANZAC spirit, iGEM UoA collaborated with the iGEM team from the University of Sydney.This was done, and a relationship was established with Turner\u0092s and Grower\u0092s NZ who were able to provide the team from Sydney with valuable information regarding the influence of fruit ripening on the produce storage and transportation industry.We exchanged with them our experience as a start-up team on what challenge we faced just to get the team together as we are all interested to know what would be the different kind of administrative barriers from a team that have a developed system and a newly set-up.The team leaders showed us around their lab area and kindly shared their detailed and well planned perspective on their human practice project which most definitely broaden our horizon as a start-up team on how extensively an iGEM can affect and influence the community.The first, a functional domain, has the ability to cleave polyethylene terephthalanie, the main plastic used in bottles world-wide, into a monomer ethylene terephthalate.Plastic is lightweight and has space-filling properties, which allow it to fill 20% of NZ\u0092s landfill space (252,000 tonnes per year), with difficult to degrade plastics such as PET contributing to up to 15% of this.In 2015, 56 million tonnes of plastic was produced worldwide; although some of this is recycled or the energy from the plastic is utilized, much of it enters landfills.Given time, effort, and perhaps a little luck, we could purify and find the 3D structure of these PET degrading enzymes, which would allow us to characterise them, and potentially refine and improve the mechanism of PET degradation for commercial use.Our part encodes for a protein derived from Idonella sakaiensis first discovered by Yoshida et al.It is here that we took inspiration for our project; to create biobricks for PETase and MHETase that, when inserted into an E. coli vector, could produce viable, purifiable proteins, that are secreted from the cell, or can be obtained through lysing the E. coli..These teams emphasised raising awareness for the implementation of safe biotechnology into daily use, to elevate the quality of human lives , and the environment.They elaborated on their human practise projects, which included working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture in Taiwan, and showed their dedication on making the agriculture sector a more biotech/engineering- friendly place.We concluded that the main difference would be the focus that shifted from the system development of the sub-teams and relationship building with the University to inter-team communication and interaction within team members.The third and final domain is a polyhistadine domain allowing for easy purification of the protein by affinity chromatography.This part was expressed using the T7 promoter (part BBa_1719005) under the control of the lac operator sequence (unpublished).Yoshida S et al.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We were able to create an effective dialogue with students, with some even asking if a

of the students and we highly appreciated there passion and thinking.\u0093It was a wonderful and engaging presentation.Furthermore, interactive-based activities were held to introduce synthetic biology, to discuss the positive and negative implications, and to clarify any misconceptions about both the field and the use of GMOs.Coupled with this, we hope that more New Zealand teams are prompted to participate in future competitions and to promote the synthetic biology field even further.The students all had positive responses to the presentation.Public education programs functioning to promote and educate high school and primary school students about the importance of recycling have been considerably effective in waste management.During these talks, we informed students about the

"description": "", "design": "The HMS will be prototyped extensively to develop a more efficient design, and its mobile app will continue to be streamlined.The fishBIT system combines the simplicity of standard fish tags with the novelty of a synthetic biology treatment.The plastic harpoon region was designed to ensure that the tag remains in its host under most forces.Overall fishBIT was able to handle both conditions very well - the clamp stayed in place, and the tag did not twist in a manner that would impeded the natural movements of the fish.To address these goals, fishPHARM has developed engineering solutions for the individualized delivery of flavocide, our bioengineered peptide treatment for BCWD, as well as a fish farm tank monitoring system for the constant monitoring of aquaculture conditions.Tugging gently on fish tags after applying them is standard procedure for tagging fish, and is a good test for the tenacity of the newly placed tag [1].One of the improvements that drylab is considering for the future is using a smaller clamp on our fish tag in order to have the tag maintain smooth movements in turbulent waters.Stress testing - We plan on using a stress machine to apply loads to the fishBIT barb, head/tubing interface, and clamp/tubing interface, in order to find maximum load capabilities.Testing of the fishBIT system in a hydraulic flow channel has shown that fishBIT can resist normal fish motion and speeds.FishPHARM presents the Heimdall Monitoring System (HMS).The main purpose of hydrodynamics testing was to see how well water at high speeds is able to flow over the fish tag.Thus, an orange was used in place of salmon tissue because the purpose of the testing was mainly to observe the flow of water over the part of the tag that is exposed outside the fish\u0092s body.This system would make treating fish a much less time-consuming process, and would increase the appeal of the fishPHARM BCWD treatment method.Based on our testing on the agar block, we expected fishBIT to not be as effective as the standard tag.FishBIT is safe for the fish, and is constructed using materials which are all approved by the FDA.Additionally, our fish tag was able to successfully remain inside the agar (more testing about the effect of water flow on fish tag embedding is discussed in the \u0093Hydrodynamics\u0094 section).However, as seen by the effect on the agar, both our applicator and tag should be made narrower in order to inflict less trauma on the fish tissue.Industry standards for salmon were used to develop the size and shape of the fish tag [2].Inspired by fish tags, devices used to track fish in the wild, fishBIT allows fish farmers to target specific fish for flavocide treatment.fishPHARM\u0092s mechanical engineering work centers around two main principles: 1) the real-world implementation of a peptide treatment for bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), and 2) the prevention of bacterial coldwater disease outbreaks on fish farms.Each delivery device can store enough flavocide to treat one fish for the prescribed dosing period, as well as be easily re-dosed, making it an effective means of treating multiple and recurring infections.Thus testing fishBIT at 1 m/s is indicative of the conditions that salmon using fishBIT will be living in.The fish tags and applicators, along with the peptide hydrogel, was packaged into a starter kit for distribution to fish farmers.However, our applicator was just as effective as the control applicator in penetrating the scales of the fish, and did not cause significantly more damage to the fish tissue.These factors are important in the health of a fish hatchery, and if improperly maintained, will lead to infections and higher mortality rates.Alternatively, a simpler test would be to attach weights to the fishBIT.This would also provide a reasonable estimate of the tensile strength.Animal and environmental safety guided the fishBIT and flavocide hydrogel design and development.A tube with an inner diameter of 1/16\" and outer diameter of 1/8\" was attached to the back of the fish tag to hold the hydrogel.A first prototype of the hardware is in the process of being built, and the mobile app is ready for testing.Future work will be done at fishPHARM to improve the design and manufacturing of fishBIT for mass production.The conclusions of our ballistics testing are also supported by the feedback from the Rome and Bath fish hatcheries.This would allow the estimation of the tensile strength of fishBIT, and to readjust the design or incorporate more durable materials if necessary.Named after the Norse god of surveillance, the HMS consists of sensor hardware to be installed within aquaculture tanks, as well as a mobile app for the continuous monitoring and collection of temperature, flow rate, dissolved oxygen concentration, and nitrate concentration.We tested fishBIT at the maximum speed of the Tilting Wind-Water Tunnel, which is approximately 1 m/s.The orange near the surface of the water represented turbulent water conditions that fishBIT would have to withstand, and the orange submerged approximately 10 cm under the surface of the water represented faster flowing water conditions.fishPHARM presents fishBIT, a novel means of delivering time-released flavocide gel to each fish individually.The control tag and the fishBIT tag both resisted a gentle tug on the exposed portion.FishBIT and the standard tags were applied with their respective applicators.We have simulated in the lab our fishBIT prototype working under the real world conditions that the device will encounter in an aquatic ecosystem.Furthermore, both the protein and the gel are both environmentally safe; the peptide is ubiquitous and the gel degrades easily.Our tag applicator was designed to be used just like conventional applicators, but with added comfort and easier handling.fishPHARM is currently working on an alternative, more efficient applicator that is inspired by firearm trigger mechanisms.Each fishBIT starter kits comes with 20 fishBIT tags, a tag applicator, a vial containing our novel flavocide, a needle, a syringe, and an information booklet.FDA-approved, biocompatible, and environmentally safe PLGA polymer will used to create the peptide hydrogel [3].FishBIT is a novel solution to drug delivery in fish.Farmers can choose to apply the fishBIT system to a few affected fish, or to their whole farms.We also wanted to make sure our applicator was as effective as the standard applicator in penetrating the skin and scales of salmon.It also serves as a marker to determine how much gel has dissolved.The bright red gel consists of the entericidin protein contained in FDA-approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid).One possible future method of delivering Flavocide would be a pneumatic injection system, which injects individual capsules in fish for rapid and accurate delivery.Additional testing will be conducted as we plan to apply for FDA approval of the device.Therefore, we used a diseased salmon and injected both systems into the tissue.We injected fishBIT and standard fish tags (from fishtagger.com) into a 1% concentration clear agar block to qualitatively assess damage done to fish tissue.A syringe was used to insert the hydrogel into the tube, and a clamp was placed at the end to prevent hydrogel escape.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "Figure 1: The initial setup of the Part 2 model, showing the concentration of EcnB within the fish tag.Because the biodegradable hydrogel used to carry our EcnB peptide has several tunable properties including rate of biodegradation and internal concentration of EcnB, we decided to model the distribution of the peptide throughout the fish in order to better understand what properties we want in the gel.More and more peptide is released but, due to the small opening, there is a limit on how fast the peptide can diffuse out of the tag.To get at least an approximate target EcnB concentration, the Part 1 model should be adjusted and simplified.The gel has only degraded a short way through, but there is enough peptide to maintain a high flux into the fish.Figure 3: The Part 2 model after a longer time has passed.The degraded gel face has moved farther back, but the peptide concentration remains high throughout the entire tag.As can be seen in figures 2 and 3, the fish tag can maintain a high outflow concentration that approaches the initial gel concentration.We simulated hydrogel diffusion through the fish to determine the resultant concentration of EcnB peptide within a fish, assuming that all of the EcnB peptide within the gel is transferred into the subcutaneous layer of the fish.We decided to continue with the second part of the model, but using representative parameter values rather than experimental.The purpose of this second model was to find our ideal hydrogel degradation rate and peptide concentration for proper treatment of BCWD.The peptide exists only within the gel to start with.Figure 2: The Part 2 model after some time has passed.We decided on a 3D model for this part because the fish tag has some odd geometries and isn\u0092t actually symmetric.The target concentration of EcnB on the skin was bounded by the minimum effective concentration against Flavobacterium and the toxic concentration of EcnB in the fish.We found a target EcnB concentration in the blood for a predefined concentration range on the skin by adjusting initial concentration parameters of the bloodstream.The opening of the tag was modelled as an open boundary, meaning the fish is large enough that concentrations of the peptide within the fish is negligible.Both parts were designed using COMSOL Multiphysics.Knowing the EcnB concentration necessary to combat Flavobacterium alone, we worked backwards to determine an effective EcnB concentration in the salmon bloodstream.This model was divided into the drug\u0092s two main components, the EcnB and the hydrogel.We modelled the convection, diffusion, and degradation of the peptide through blood vessels, muscle tissue, and the skin of an idealized 2D fish.Because our 2D model hadn\u0092t provided reasonable answers to formulate a target outward flux from the tag, we decided to make a representative model instead.We used SolidWorks to build the hollow of the fish tag into which we would fill the gel.", "notebook": "In addition, we researched specific tubing, clamps and other materials that we intend to utilize for the fish tag Policy and Practices We moved on to the topic of proteins to start to relate what we were introducing to YOURS kids with our own project so they would understand the relevance of our research.We also did research on a list of potentially compatible materials for the fish tag, including tubing, clamps, and syringes.Drylab Dry lab continued with the CAD design of the fish tag.Wetlab We encountered issues with getting past ligation stage with synthesized plasmid inserts and H backbone.To confirm EcnB expression, several SDS-PAGEs were done on constructs without stabilizing proteins to use for Western blots (to see their expression) and later ZOI assays.Drylab Dry lab outlined a comprehensive timeline for constructing business plan, fish tag testing, app design, and marketing.Drylab Dry lab discussed and finalized a

them.That same week, both hatcheries and the field station were able to give us valuable critiques including their opinion on the size of our product, the ease of application, and even encouraged us to continue with what they believed to be a valuable contribution to improvement of the fish industry.Drylab Dry lab continued with the design of labels and business cards.Policy and Practices We sent our prototype of the fishBit to Rome Fish Hatchery and the Cornell Biological Field Station for feedback.Policy and Practices We continued the topic of DNA in bacteria with the YOURS kids by talking about antibiotic resistance and how we only want certain genes in our own experiments.Members conducted research into various aspects of the aquaculture industry, consumer behavior, and finances in order to construct a comprehensive business plan.He talked to us about the fish they raise, the types of diseases the fish face such as ferunculosis, and the overall day-to-day things the hatchery has to worry about like maintenance.Wetlab We cultured, ligated, and plated some of the new plasmids (A(LMNJKR) +H).We learned that the hatchery has chosen not to use fish tags and instead clips fish fins to keep track.There were some weird results on gels of other constructs, possibly due to mutations in the backbone (H).Flavobacterium growth was tested on different types of plates to see if our plates were the issue causing lack of growth.Drylab Business plan was reviewed by a professor with expertise in the area.Drylab Members designed potential business cards along with labels for the flavocide gel vials.Drylab Dry lab continued with construction of the box.We also received synthesized plasmids from DNA 2.0 with all EcnB inserts from biobricked Z constructs and MBP-TEV (not in pSB1C3).Sensor design for the app was started.Sweet\u0092s opinion of the future for the fish/agriculture industry was that the environment would put greater stresses on wild fish and therefore depending on farm-raised fish would be beneficial in supplying the demand for more food in a world with a rising population.We had some issues with low DNA concentrations after gel purifications, so we increased amount of DNA used in digestions.The flavo subteam made cultures of two strains of Flavobacterium, and measured growth of bacteria with spectrophotometer.We also did a fun experiment with the kids with basic cooking ingredients to make a \u0093volcano explode\u0094 to introduce chemical reactions.Policy and Practices iGem members Grace, Casey, and Rishabh attended the Sciencenter Building with Biology event where they helped enthusiastic science-lovers on a Saturday morning learn how to spread plates, demonstrated the possibilities of 3D printing, and simulated rearranging genes with legos.Policy and Practices We took the YOURS kids to the Bathe hatchery.On Saturday, Grace and Saie went to the local Ithaca\u0092s Farmer\u0092s Market to find locals with opinions about GMOs and fish farming for our Humans and SynBio Facebook page.We listed materials, dimensions, and designs that would make up our fish tag kit.Finally, we explained our own project\u0092s goals and how we would be going to a hatchery the next week to see how farmers have to handle bacterial diseases that affect fish.Drylab To market the product, the tag needs an appealing name.Policy and Practices We began searching for fish farm contacts, and started our YOURS mentorship program.We also tried ZOI test on Flavobacterium plates (of both strains), with ZA, ZB, and Chloramphenicol and dH2O as controls.We spoke to Bob Sweet who explained how they keep an eye on various conditions in the fish s environment through the use of chemicals.Wetlab ZE construct was sequenced and stored as glycerol stock along ZK, ZO, ZA, and ZB.Drylab Dry lab tested the durability of fishBIT using agar gel samples and dead fish samples.We re-plated Flavobacterium on new plates(both strains).Dry lab came up with the design of a box that can be used to market our products.In addition, we began researching sensors that could potentially complement the app.We successfully sequenced and glycerol stocked ZR, ZL, and ZJ constructs.We contacted Bath hatchery and set up a meeting time in July so that we could drive there and talk to representatives in person and our project in perspective of current solutions.SILS is a program of the Office of Undergraduate Biology (OUB) at Cornell that invited undergraduates to present their summer research activities.We hope to use any advice and critiques to update our fishBit to fit the industry\u0092s needs in the best way possible.Policy and Practices iGem members Sachi and Saie presented at the The Summer Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) symposium.Wetlab We had issues with growing cultures for Gibson plates.Wetlab The second set of western blot revealed expression of ZG, MJ, and ZT.Wetlab Had some issues growing cultures on plates.AA+H (ZA) construct and AA+B (ZB) construct were sent for sequencing to verify the contents of the construct.Wetlab EcnB part extracted from A(ABEF) synthesized plasmids and purified.We introduced our mentors to the kids and taught them about DNA and its importance.We were also directed to speak to Andy Norse at Rome Hatchery who was more aware of chemicals used to treat water to prevent diseases, and we followed up with a call on Monday to plan a Skype meeting with Andy.Switched focus to getting expression from all biobricked Z constructs and MJ to use in ZOI assays.Wetlab At this stage, Z(A,B,E,G,J,K,L,O,R) constructs have been biobricked.The kids learned how to pipet and load something into a gel and watched as we showed them how we run gel electrophoresis experiments everyday.They learned about the ubiquitous nature of bacteria when they used cotton swabs to gather different bacterial samples from different areas in the building and let the samples grow overnight.Started using Phusion PCR on all constructs that had not been biobricked (for increased yield).Drylab Dry lab finalized plans for testing fishBIT.We determined that our plates (for the Flavobacterium) were the issue.Wetlab We had to re-culture several plasmids (pre-ligation).Drylab Meeting addressed fundamental parts of a business plan.The YOURS students also learned about how the fish are raised and transported in detail and were allowed to feed the fish.", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "When lifting heavy objects, proper lifting technique was used, and an appropriate number of individuals were used for lifting said objects.Training : All team members who work in the wet lab must complete Cornell EH&S general lab safety and chemical waste disposal courses prior to the onset of work.During this program, safety officers reinforce safety procedures learned during the EH&S courses, discuss safety protocol pertaining to specific chemicals with which we work, and ensure all lab members fully understand all safety procedures.In the case of the wet lab in particular, this involves going through a detailed list of protocols, including all organisms, chemicals, and genetic constructs being worked with, to ensure conformity with the Environmental Health & Safety guidelines.Prior to the onset of work for the year, all new members are required to go through a safety training program.These team members are responsible for discussing the proposed work plan for the project with the wet lab and machine shop managers before starting work to ensure that it is safe to continue.These team members also act as liaisons to the wet lab and machine shop managers and, when necessary, the Institutional Biosafety Committee to ensure proper equipment usage.One team member each was chosen for the wet and dry lab subteams to ensure that all team members are working safely, whether with bacterial cultures or power tools.During these sessions, Dr. Archer familiarizes new members with the safety equipment and procedures specific to the labspace in which we work.They must go through the same safety training as all other team members, but are required to redo the training each time we recruit new members in order to keep up-to-date with safety considerations.While working in the machine shop we maintained a clean work environment so we could maintain visibility at all times.Enforcement: Team members who violate safety rules are required to work under the supervision of the safety officers for the remainder of the week, or until the safety officer believes the member is capable of performing the task unsupervised.Additionally, all team members must complete a lab orientation session with the manager of the BME instructional lab, Dr. Shivaun Archer.Dry Lab: We use the Emerson Machine Shop for fabrication; each of the dry lab subteam members has attended the prescribed training session for use of the shop and has learned to use each of the tools safely.Environmental Safety: If any biological materials escape from the lab there is a risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance from our engineered strains into other organisms.In addition, they maintain contact with the supervisors of the workspaces, usually in the form of a weekly check-in, to discuss any safety concerns that have arisen and ensure that equipment continues to be used properly.Safety Officers: The safety officers were chosen to be team members who could directly supervise the activities of the other team members.Laboratory Safety: Our project involves regular use of ethidium bromide, a DNA-intercalating agent known to cause cancer, as well as the use of powerful UV light, for visualization of gel electrophoresis.We maintain 2 copies of MSDS s for every chemical we use in the lab: one for our own records and one for the lab manager and users of the lab space who are not part of our team.Closed-toe shoes and long pants were also worn when working in the machine shop.Each member of the dry lab subteam was trained in the safe usage of the milling machine and the metal lathe.Wet Lab: All lab members wear nitrile gloves, closed-toe shoes, and use eye protection when working with volatile chemicals or UV light.All machine shop work is conducted under the supervision of the Emerson machine shop staff.For multiple infractions or complete disregard to safety protocols, a member may be restricted from laboratory work until he/she undergoes EHS chemical safety online training again, and demonstrates proper performance to a team leader of failed technique(s) in a controlled setting.All toxic waste is placed in a specialized receptacle and is picked up and disposed of by Cornell Environmental Health and Safety.We also work with ethanol lamps to maintain a sterile environment, which do involve having an open flame on the benchtop.It has been classified as a Biosafety Level 1 organism according to the NIH, and is thus essentially harmless to the human population.All biohazard waste is autoclaved and transported to the building s centralized waste facility where it is disposed of as regulated biological waste.These courses set specific guidelines and are the standard requirement for work in a biosafety-level 1 lab at Cornell.", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite": "", "part_normal":

and handled and are therefore suitable for field projects, as long as the GMO guidelines of the country allow the usage outside of a S1 laboratory.To validate the persistence of the alginate capsules we cultivated beads containing encapsulated bacteria in LB medium (without any selective antibiotics) for several time periods (1h, 2h, 3h).We did not perform further testing but expect that lysis of capsules reaches a saturation at one point due to protonation of the used acid.Above we have highlighted many aspects of biosafety concerning the release of our bacteria from our device.Due to our experience with capsule treatment we can assure that breaking of capsules and therefore GMO release will not occur in daily handling of the device.Capsules were as well cracked mechanically and analyzed in the light microscope, where cells were visible in the alginate structures but did not show any movement.In a next step the biosafety encapsulated bacteria are bonded to the microfluidic diagnostic device.As our diagnostic method requires direct contact between the patient sample and the detecting bacteria, special provisions needed to be found to ensure an easy but safe handling of the GMOs.The challenge of our project was to create an application which is safe but still suitable for the requirements in developing countries.We did not measure the power needed to crack the capsules but did need several approaches before we finally managed to crack down the alginate structure to pieces which were small enough for microscopy.To determine lysis of capsules in solution - especially keeping in mind that the pH of vaginal samples which will be needed for chlamydia-testing is about 4.5 to 4.7 we incubated capsules in 100 mL 1 mM HCl and another sample in 100 mL 10 % acetic acid.During its polymerization the alginic acid develops pores which are big enough to allow smaller molecules like mDAP to enter the capsule but too small for the bacteria to escape.The diagnostic chamber is probed with the patient s serum which passes through several filters before it is exposed to the capsules and the contained diagnostic bacteria.To validate that the absence of growth was not due to cell death in the encapsulation process we dissolved the capsules in 55 mM sodium citrate for approx.Hourly OD600 measurement of the LB-Medium showed that there was no bacteria escape occurrence.Therefore we postulate that due to efficient fixation of the bacteria in the alginate polymer encapsulation escape is not possible.After 15 min incubation about 75 % of capsules in the HCl-solution and about 50 % of the capsules in the acetic acid were already dissolved.Additionally they are not able to survive outside of the laboratory hence do not pose any harm to the environment.Taking an outlook into future biosafety maximization one comes up with several approaches.Given that exposure to light of 495 nm induces fluorescence of the reporter system, light exposure could also induce a light dependent kill-switch.That ensures the reliable diagnosis of chlamydial infections without the risk of a direct contact between people or the environment and the genetically modified E. coli.An increased OD600 after 1 hour of reculturing proved the viability of an uncertain percentage of cells in the capsules.Given that there are already plenty of well working established kill-switches available as biobricks, it would be easiest to transform our cells containing the mTaz-sensing and fluorescence reporter system with one of the existing systems.30 min incubation in vaginal sample in the device.Additionally, we want to emphasize the biosafety of the used organisms by themselves.E.coli is a naturally derived organism from humans.Therefore these organisms are classified as the lowest risk for safety and health for humans and to team members and people working with them.Therefore the device would be inactivated directly after measurement and usage - providing a biosafe waste disposal of the used device.We analyzed 1ul of the solution through light microscopy and noted cell movement and activity.The capsules remain trapped inside the chambers of the device as the size of their diameter (100 \u00b5m) exceeds the size of the filter meshes (20 \u00b5m) that border the chambers at the openings of the inlet and outlet channels.JW3367-3 are specially modified bacteria of the strain E.coli that lack the EnvZ/OmpR cascade signalling.", "keywords": "Bio-Pattern hydrolysate trachomatis bioluminescence reinhardti desalination BBa_K530002

project, we introduce a gene coding for an enzyme called microcystinase (MlrA) into yeast cells.The first step in the detection of microcystin is to get the toxin inside the yeast cell.We also hope to be able to predict the response of our promoter constructs to different microcystin levels with the help of modeling results.Both the detection and degradation are implemented with the help of

promoter regions of genes involved in oxidative stress response are coupled to genes coding for yellow fluorescent protein.We hope that the level of fluorescence will correspond to the extent of oxidative stress, and therefore also the concentration of microcystin.We will have three variants of the enzyme to optimize its expression in yeast cells.This increases the activity of certain transcription factors, which activate genes involved in the oxidative stress response (He and Fassler, 2005).Consequently, when encountering microcystin, our yeast will start to produce yellow fluorescent protein, and the resulting fluorescence can then be measured.Check out our introduction video \u0093Matti and the cyanobacteria\u0094 to see how our solution for this problem would

"human_practice": "We had a many meetings right in the beginning of our project just to hear from different experts what they consider to be synthetic biology, what they thought of our various ideas and how they would proceed with the project.Addressing a local problem creates an affinity between our project and the public, and also makes it easier for us to promote synthetic biology to them.We wanted to see what kind of need there was for informing the general public about all the possibilities synthetic biology offers, as well as, from our project\u0092s point of view, the need to inform about the dangers of cyanobacteria.These experts gave us much appreciated information and new perspectives to our ideas When our team started brainstorming for the project idea, our general knowledge of what would be feasible and what wouldn\u0092t was quite insufficient.They have also helped us during the course of our project - for example the degradation part of our project would not have ended up being what it is without their help.The University of Helsinki\u0092s Faculty of Science wrote an article about our project and especially what the two mathematicians of our team had learned from this synthetic biology project.They guided us to the Finnish Environment Institute (Suomen ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6keskus, SYKE), where we got to discuss the cyanobacteria problem and our project with experts.In the beginning, we didn\u0092t really understand how scary and strange a branch synthetic biology seems to be for people not involved in it, but during the project we started to understand this.When we met with companies, there was also a lot of discussion of the potential commercialization of our project, which meant patenting our idea.We didn\u0092t change much in our project topic itself based on the interviews but we increased the importance of talking to the public.Although neither the topic of our project nor the nature of iGEM made patenting seem like a relevant concern, we nevertheless thought it would be useful to gain an understanding of this aspect.After that we were able to also think about the modelling part of our project and how it could support the experimental parts of our work.We have written about the meetups on the We have created a website in addition to the Wiki which includes team descriptions, as well as a brief introduction to our project and partners.Our detection device would contain live yeast cells to produce the fluorescence signal, and is the main concern of our project when thinking about accidental release of GMOs.One result of our efforts to communicate with the non-scientific community was our project introduction video \u0093Matti and the cyanobacteria\u0094, found on our We participated in two iGEM meetups, the ones in Stockholm and Paris, which gave us many things to consider in our project.As a part of the recruiting the next year\u0092s team, we will present our project in a few different events, such as the Water Day of the Aalto Unviersity School of Engineering, where different projects related to the water industry are presented, and the Career Day of Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences of the University of Helsinki.We also talked about the possibility to use genetically modified yeast as a sensor in the natural environment and it was nice to hear that they didn\u0092t turn this idea down even if it is not allowed by the Finnish legislation at the moment.how to explain that cyanobacteria are a problem for people who don\u0092t live in Finland and don t have the same problems with it as we do.We talked with ThermoFisher, Algol and LAL (Luonnontieteiden akateemisten liitto), and they showed great interest in our project, even helping us with the funding.Keeping this in mind and inspired by the Finnish nature and lifestyle, we decided to approach the problem of blue-green algae in the context of sauna water, thus limiting the scope of our products to a few drops of water and to maximum one bucket of water (~20 L) for the detection and degradation, respectively.That\u0092s why meeting Merja Oja, who works with modeling biological systems, was very important in the beginning of our project.Still, as each of the interviewed people had encountered blue-green algae, it means that our project can touch their lives and possibly to facilitate their life in the future.We will be presenting our project results and achievements from the Jamboree to some of our sponsors, as well as school representatives.They gave us valuable input on our thoughts of harnessing the yeast stress response Finnish legislation towards genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is strict, similar to the rest of the European Union.As the information has had a significant effect on the design of our project, it will be presented more deeply in integrated human practices section.Some of the most important modifications we did in our presentations to people with limited biological background was dismissing almost all scientific terms, assuming no background information, focusing on what we can achieve with our project instead of the exact methodology, and leaving more time for questions.The most valuable information from our meeting with SYKE, the Finnish Environment Institute, was that we learned what kind of solutions already exist for the blue green algae problem.Even though our team had students from fields ranging from biotechnology to mathematics, there wasn\u0092t anyone who really understood both fields well enough to have a clear idea of what modelling is like in the field synthetic biology.As we didn\u0092t have much experience on protein production in yeast and as it was in a focal role in our project, we needed some help in planning our enzyme constructs.Putting a lot of thought into justifications for our choices at this point of our project turned out to be very useful, since after that, we didn\u0092t have to regret that we should have done something in a completely different way.In Stockholm, the SDU team couldn\u0092t present their full project because they were in the process of patenting it.They also discussed with us the business aspects of our project and gave us good advice on how to build our business strategy if we are to bring our algae detection and degradation methods to masses.Later in the project, we had a meeting with Algol, one of sponsors, where we presented our results.When we had decided on the top three project ideas, we met with researchers working with these different subjects as a part of the background research we did about the different options.We told them about our project, discussed synthetic biology and the use of biotechnology in Finland.This would also let our project be more approachable and understandable to the the public as well as sponsors.If the Cyanobacteria group and professor Frey along with his group affected the degradation aspect of our project the most, Jussi J\u00e4ntti and his research group from VTT likely contributed the most to the detection part.Especially talking with our primary PI Markus Linder directed our brainstorming and ideation, which finally led up to the final design of the project.From interviewing people in the streets, we learned that public knowledge about synthetic biology was rather restricted.In addition, as the synthetic amino acid couldn\u0092t be scavenged from the environment, the GMOs would survive only as long as they are externally supplemented by the amino acids.Besides gaining information about the need of synthetic biology outreach, we wanted to see what people know about blue green algae and if it has caused problems for them.Thanks to input from Kaarina Sivonen and her group, the decision about our project subject was finalized.Our team gave them a presentation about our project and synthetic biology.Also, Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering posted an article about our project, iGEM, and synthetic biology.Each of our team members has also presented themselves, so if you want to get to know our team a bit better, check out the blog: Even though Wiki Freeze and the Giant Jamboree are here, we have still some human practices left after all this.With our project, we hope to improve the understanding about synthetic biology and GMOs.If the use of GMOs was legal, our yeast based detection system could provide an easy and affordable solution.Additionally, as we learned how restricted the knowledge about our topic is, we have been able to adjust our presentations better for the targeted audiences.We have given much consideration to the ethical implications of our work.As we had also gotten sponsorships from certain companies they posted about us and our project on their web pages which was nice.In addition, LAL will publish an article in their member magazine about our iGEM experience after the Jamboree.In both meetups, we were presented with the idea of patenting one\u0092s work.It was great to see that so many people were interested in our project as well as modelling in synthetic biology.Many of these experts gave us much appreciated information and new aspects to our ideas that have guided our project towards what it is today.He also questioned our choice to use yeast at all in the enzyme production, and made us broaden our thinking and justify our ideas.They guided us to plan our detection device so that it would correspond to the current need - being available for the public and not be too expensive.This convinced us that we were on right track with the degradation.Our project was on display in the media.In Paris, we participated in a panel discussion where part of the discussion was about patents and the openly communicated nature of iGEM projects.The team\u0092s acceptance of the idea was driven by how popular the problem was in Finland.In addition to Luma we gave a talk on \u0093Mathematical Modelling in Synthetic Biology\u0094 for math students at the University of Helsinki.Hopefully we were able to inspire them to continue with the study of biology in the future and perhaps even try themselves in the field of synthetic biology.In addition, to adopt a biological containment strategy, we would engineer several essential proteins in our yeast cells to have a dependency on non-standard amino acids for their proper translation, folding and function, as described by Mandell et al.This was supposed to be part of our project, but unfortunately time constraints prevented us from doing this.We want to stir up the conversation about GMO legislation, and be part of the discussion about how GMOs could be used outside of the lab and by general public.After giving them a \u0093Biology 101\u0094 lecture, they got to hear how modelling was done in our project.The article was later posted also on the university\u0092s main news page.It seemed that the general conception of synthetic biology was something quite foreign and that there is a need for raising awareness of the hazards of cyanobacteria.However, as our plan would be to use the capsules for small quantities of water (bucket-scale), releasing this capsule in just one bucket of water alleviates such concerns; as the enzymes are scaled for such a small quantity, they would be extremely diluted when released to the open environment.All of the interviewed people were familiar with it but didn\u0092t know much about the health or economic problems it causes.We consider them a part of our human practices since we got a lot of input from them for our project, and got to talk about our ideas with other iGEMers.It is necessary to properly design the kit so that the yeast cells are contained within the device, in addition to placing biosafety measures for the possibility that the GMOs would escape the device, either caused by the device breaking or because of product misuse.The kind of synthetic auxotrophy described by Mandell can be considered a more advanced and secure method of biocontainment, and in particular if combined with still other containment strategies, it would make it highly unlikely that our yeast could bypass the biocontainment.We have also been or will be a part of our sponsors\u0092 blogs.We also discussed current detection methods and according to them, all the available detection methods are rather expensive and hardly any of them is available for the public.We hope that this has helped people follow our work better and in a way bring them closer to our research and what it is like to be a part of an iGEM team.The precautionary principle is a concept used in risk management and according to it, if an action is suspected to be harmful for the public or the environment and there is no scientific agreement on the matter, then the burden of proof that it is not harmful lies on the party which is carrying out the suspected action.This gave us additional courage to choose our GMO yeast sensor as our project idea.As multiple genes would be dependent on the synthetic amino acids, escaping biocontainment via mutagenesis would require mutations in a large number of genes.In order to gain more insight into the problem of cyanobacteria in Finland, we contacted the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.Even though many experts gave us advice and guided our brainstorming, deciding about the topic and more precise plans were left for ourselves.We met with high school students who were candidates for the Finnish team of the International Biology Olympiad.to spread the word of iGEM as well as tell people about our project and about ourselves.They described the full extent of algae detection problem in Finland and all the strategies used in the past and at the moment to deal with it both in research and industry.They found our approach interesting and promising since they have been trying to deal with the blue-green algae problem for many years now.It was discussed that communication really is the key when trying to create business in this field, and that researchers should learn how to communicate about this seemingly outlandish field to the general public.It was also nice to hear that there was no available method for the present day to get rid of the cyanobacteria or the toxins.We talked with experts from different universities and research centers in the fields of biology, genetic engineering, biological modeling and cyanobacterial research.In large part, negative attitudes towards GMOs can stem from connotations of certain words, as well as the perception of strangeness in the daily lives of people.The Gene Technology Act is based on the EU Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC, which concern the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment and the contained used of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), respectively.In high concentrations, lysozyme could also have drastic effects on the ecosystem, as it can can lyse the cell walls of many bacteria.As discussed above, our conclusion was that it didn\u0092t seem relevant to our project.Without them we probably wouldn\u0092t have thought to use flow cytometry, which ended up providing important support and verification for our other results!We also got good practise on how to communicate with people who don\u0092t have much background in biology, not to mention synthetic biology.This would allow detection of microcystin in the water while ensuring that the yeast stays inside the device.Algol has posted a few posts about our journey in iGEM on their blog, and want to also publish something once we return from Boston.We wanted our products to have minimal side-effects on the environment and that meant limiting the reach of any genetically modified organism present in those products.The broadcast of the episode can be listened here: http://areena.yle.fi/1-3424583 (in Finnish).Their input greatly affected our choice of using modified yeast as the detection chassis organism.Our degradation enzyme capsule, on the other hand, would not contain any living cells - only commercial lysozyme and enzymes derived from the genetically modified microorganisms.TEK magazine, the magazine of Tekniikan akateemiset, an organization for Academics of Technology, published an article about us as well.We found about the Cyanobacteria research group of the University of Helsinki and met with them.They also gave us input on our results and gave ideas on possibilities to take things further, e.g.(Geenitekniikan lautakunta) As it is impossible to predict the cascade of consequences resulting from GMOs being released into the environment, caution in this respect is well-advised.The enzyme has a specificity for the Adda-arginine bond, which is only present in cyanotoxins.This would have to be done in an especially fool-proof manner if the kit was to be commercialized.We reasoned that by working with baker\u0092s yeast (common name for Saccharomyces cerevisiae), an organism familiar to most people with neutral if not positive connotations, our work would feel more approachable to and less detached from people\u0092s everyday lives.In addition, the genetic material of decomposed GMOs could be taken up by other organisms, leading to even more possibilities for unwanted consequences.In Finland, the Gene Technology Act regulates the use of GMOs and promotes the safe use and development of gene technology along with ethical practices and consideration of the precautionary principle (Geenitekniikan lautakunta).This gave us a lot to think, since our project\u0092s final product was designed to be a genetically engineered organism used outside the lab.Based on this, we really thought that there was a need to increase knowledge about synthetic biology.It also contains a description of synthetic biology, a safety conscious statement, and an explanation of what iGEM is.", "modeling": "To this end, we have chosen three naturally occurring promoters from genes involved in the yeast\u0092s oxidative stress response: CTT1, CPP1 and TSA1.As part of our project, we are designing a novel detection mechanism for the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin using live yeast cells.In our concept for the detection mechanism, a sample of water, either contaminated with microcystin or not, is supplemented to a culture of live yeast cells.As an Oxidative Stress Response mechanism, Yap1p is localized and accumulated in the nucleus.Meanwhile, the other two promoters have binding sites for Yap1p and for a third transcription factor Skn7p.The essential principle is to couple the yeast\u0092s natural response against the toxin to the production of a yellow ?uorescent protein, Venus.To study our detection mechanism mathematically, we have created a model for the transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7 and their activation in the cells, hoping to determine production patterns and thresholds of YFP and provide suggestions for optimal promoter design for future iterations of the project.CTT1 has a single binding site for a transcription factor known as YAP1 and at least one binding site for the factor MSN2.The detection mechanism then functions as follows: the genetically modi?ed yeast take the toxin in through a specific transporter (QDR2 from strain VL3), after which the toxin inhibits the function of protein phosphatases in the cell.The cell naturally ?ghts against this accumulation of harmful oxygen species through a mechanism known as Oxidative Stress Response,

in \u0093Protein detection using proximity-dependent DNA ligation assays\u0094 (Fredriksson, Gullberg, et al.).to create a paper-based gene network featuring an aptamer-based genetic switch that was capable of producing a colorimetric output in the presence of a chosen target protein.It is our goal to use the technology outlined in \u0093Paper-based synthetic gene networks\u0094 (Pardee, Green, et al.)Last year, we were inspired by \u0093Toehold switches: de-novo-designed regulators of gene expression\u0094 (Green, Silver, et al.)to mount our dehydrated synthetic gene network onto paper test strips that could be cheaply and effectively used as diagnostic devices similar to those discussed in \u0093Rapid, Low-Cost Detection of Zika Virus Using Programmable Biomolecular Components\u0094 (Pardee, Green, et al).While we are testing this with Thrombin as the target protein, we believe that by changing the aptamers, this system could be used to detect any target you choose, opening the doors for a wide range of diagnostic uses.", "design": "In order to drive transcription of the lacZ alpha-fragment, one of the single-stranded DNA molecules contains a T7 promoter.The DNA is double-stranded in the promoter region, a requirement for T7 polymerase activity.The lacZ alpha fragment is then transcribed, producing mRNA.The alpha fragment is used rather than the full lacZ gene to limit the length of the single stranded DNA probes; extremely long probes have not been tested in proximity dependent ligation reactions to our knowledge.Once the aptamers seek out and bind to our target protein, the single-stranded DNA molecules are brought into very close proximity.AMV reverse transcriptase is then able to fill in the single-stranded DNA, making it double-stranded.This DNA strand encodes the alpha-fragment of the lacZ gene.A DNA bridge, which is complementary to sequences on both single-stranded DNA molecules, binds to the two strands, holding them in place.It is important to note that this reaction can be performed at a constant temperature near 37oC so it does not require specialized lab equipment.The alpha fragment that is produced complements with the lacZ delta M15 mutant, which is constitutively expressed in the same reaction mixture on a separate DNA template.NASBA uses Avian Myeloblastosis Virus Reverse Transcriptase to reverse transcribe DNA from the mRNA template.We then must free the DNA from the RNA:DNA hybrids, in order to produce double stranded DNA.The double-stranded DNA contains a T7 promoter, enabling it to express the lacZ alpha-fragment.Proximity dependent ligation works by using two single-stranded DNA molecules with aptamer ends.", "human_practice": "To achieve this, our team was sure to meet with health professionals both involved in the field of tuberculosis and/or synthetic biology, which helped shape the direction and concept of our project from its scientific concept in the wet lab all the way to

producing a color visible to the naked eye.Successfully deleted the alpha fragment in our Lacz plasmid, leaving only the omega fragment.", "safety": "Even if the recombinant DNA used in our project were taken up by a natural microorganism, it codes for two fragments of beta galactosidase, an enzyme which is classified as a non-hazardous substance by GHS and HCS (4).The DNA used in our design is unlikely to be taken up and expressed by a naturally occurring microorganism because all DNA segments are linear and the T7 promoter driving expression is not transcribed by healthy bacteria.Inspired by The Chinese University of Hong Kong\u0092s 2012 project that featured a safety component that targets DNA using CRISPR (1).The primary safety considerations of the project relate to its use as a diagnostic device.Addressed here is a wide range of points on the safety of the Michigan Synthetic Biology Team s project in the laboratory and beyond.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of public saftey or environmental safety?Although these precautions alleviate some common concerns regarding the use of recombinant DNA outside the lab, it is important to remember that the project does still utilize recombinant DNA and therefore requires diligent consideration of possible unforeseen environmental effects.Another potential danger would be the requirement of working with a small quantity of bodily fluid to operate the device.Do any of the new Biobrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?If it is decided to use this system, several different promoters could be tested with the DNase part in order to find the right level of expression.A DNase-based suicide gene has applications with any cell-free synthetic gene network.When developing such a device, false negatives and false positives are a major source of concern, and the potential damage of misdiagnosis must be carefully weighed against the benefits of diagnosing the disease correctly and quickly.Our design is more simplistic; it relies on the weak expression of DNase I.Any bodily fluid must be treated as a potential source of disease transfer between the patient and others.Although accuracy and reliability have a large effect on a device\u0092s safety, it is difficult to predict these parameters at such an early stage of development.The antibiotic resistance plasmids that are used for cloning should never leave a laboratory setting and would not be a part of the final product.Safety is, of course, one of the foremost concerns when designing a synthetic biology system.With a mass produced product that is based on exposed synthetic genes, there is a small chance of natural transformation by environmental bacteria.The University of Michigan\u0092s Department of Occupational Safety and Environmental Health reviewed the team\u0092s laboratory and practices multiple times, and found that our lab space met their requirements for safety.The full beta galactosidase enzyme is classified as a non-hazardous substance under GHS and HCS standards (4).There is no chassis organism in the final product which can escape into the environment.The in vitro nature of our final product would remove several potential hazards associated with a device utilizing live cells.University Oxford\u0092s 2015 project included a part for DNase I and the necessary chaperone peptide (DbsA) (2).Our project is designed to function entirely on a piece of paper; no organism (besides the user) is required to make it work.", "keywords":

"background": "World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the prevalence of pre-diabetes is increasing worldwide, and it is projected that more than 470 million people will have pre-diabetes in 2030.Our idea is to develop a device to monitor people\u0092s glucose with a user-friednly and non-invasive way in terms of a great lack of pre-diabetic awareness.Meanwhile, for developed countries, a growing population over the age of 60 makes up the largest proportion of diabetes prevalence.Before having diabetes, an early warning sign would appear which blood sugar levels exceed the normal range.[1] World Health Organization, Global report on diabetes, (2016)[3] Sanjay Kalra, Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors: A Review of Their Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, Diabetes Theory (2014)[4] Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine 19thDue to unstable glucose level, once the glucose level exceeds the SGLT2 s limit, the extra glucose which is higher than 180 mg/dl would not be absorbed and would be spotted in urine afterward[3].If the blood sugar level is usually above the normal range, the risk of developing full-blown diabetes would increase drastically.Moreover, Type II diabetes is mainly due to insensitivity of insulin, resulting in malfunctioning blood glucose regulation.The majority of Type 1 patient are children.Type2 diabetes- which is characterized by non-insulin dependence, and sometimes may combine with relatively reduced insulin secretion.Type 2 diabetes comprises the majority of people with diabetes around the world.According to the graph, it presents that more people under the age of 60 suffers from diabetes in many middle- and low-income countries.However, SGLT2 can only transport glucose with the maximum blood glucose level of 180 mg/dl.The global prevalence of diabetes among adults has risen from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014.Meanwhile, the prevalence of diabetes among adults in Taiwan is 10%.3.Almost half of all deaths attributable to high blood glucose occur before the age of 70 years.The glucose reabsorption is a process via SGLT1/2, members of the sodium glucose cotransporter family which are sodium-dependent glucose transport proteins.Among these two cotransporters, SGLT2 is the major cotransporter involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidney, proximately processing 90% of totally glucose reabsorption.Overall, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.The figure describes the prevalence of diabetes in different age groups in Taiwan, West Pacifics, and the world.The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014[1].All the glucose particles are supposed to be recollected after the reabsorption process.In 2012, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes and another 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose.6.", "description": "Yet, in order to make glucose be effective to PBAD the required concentration should exceed 0.01%.Arabinose is added under the test paper coated with our E. coliMoreover, in our device, powder of L-arabinose is added at the bottom of column, which would not permeate the membrane until the urine is added.In contrast, when the glucose concentration is high, the adenylyl cyclase activity, cAMP, and CRP are decreased in the bound form.Also, it is clinically proved that a healthy person with attention to the blood sugar control, lifestyle modifications and medications can successfully avoid the complications associated with it., Monitoring the sugar would be a good start for glucose control and achieve the aim, prevention.Crucial role for the spacing between the CRP binding site and the -10 region, Biochemistry (1992)[4] NL Lee, et al., Mechanism of araC autoregulation and the domains of two overlapping promoters, Pc and PBAD, in the L-arabinose regulatory region of Escherichia coli, PNAS (1984)[5] L.M.Thus, the PBAD expression system can be controlled with two often-seen substance, glucose and arabinose.Consequently, an more explicit expression of downstream RFP E1010 can be a reporter gene as well as an indicator of the presence of glucose.In terms of bio-safety, we designed the circuit that consists of PBAD promoter and lysis gene.[1] B De Crombrugghe, et al., Cyclic AMP receptor protein: role in transcription activation, Science (1984)[2] S Busby, et al., Mutations in the Escherichia coli operon that define two promoters and the binding site of the cyclic AMP receptor protein, Journal of molecular biology (1982)[3] M Lavigne, et al., Transcription activation by cAMP receptor protein (CRP) at the Escherichia coli gal P1 promoter.Hence, the steric hindrance between CRP and RNA polymerase will repress downstream genes at a high concentration of CRP[2].If the sample contains no glucose at all, the circuit will be turn on to produce lysis which result in cytolysis (or cell death)[5].With the presence of arabinose, AraC (BBa_I13458) dimers would bind to it and then change its conformation so that it interacts with the AraI1 and AraI2 operator sites, permitting the downstream transcription[4].After adding the urine sample, the L-arabinose would then dissolve and react with E. coli, which is coated on the test paper.In the absence of arabinose, the dimerized repressor protein araCs would bind to the AraI1 operator site of PBAD and the upstream operator site AraO2 would block transcription of PBAD.Using PBAD as the promoter for lysis empowers us to control the lysis process better.However, under the environment of a high glucose concentration, PBAD would be definitely inhibited.It causes a decrease of glucose concentration and a higher CRP concentration.[3].Moreover, most of the blood glucose measuring devices on the market are invasive types and not user friendly.We designed this biosensor for urine glucose measurements via a plasmid integrating a glucose-induced promoter PI (BBa_K861170) and a monomeric RFP (BBa_E1010).And there are significantly positive correlation between fluorescence intensity and glucose concentrations.Promoter PI consists of overlapping consensus cAMP-receptor-protein-binding sites (CRP-binding sites) and consensus RNA polymerase binding site[1].", "design": "Toggle navigation NCKUTainan Project Background Description Results Modeling Parts

concentration of: 0, 1, 3, 5, 15, 30, 45 mM to induce our U. coli for 12 hours in 96 well and measure the fluorescent intensity at excitation/emission wavelength 562 nm / 599 nm, the differences of fluorescent intensity between each group had statistical significance (P<0.05, student t-test) at T (time) = 8hr.Figure 5: Fluorescence intensity with 95% confidence interval after 8 hour induction with final glucose concentration 0, 1, 3, 5, 15, 30, 45 mM, all differences between each group shows statistical significance (P<0.05, student t-test), proving that out U. coli do differentiate urine sample containing various amount of glucose, ranging from 0~45 mM.Based on the results above, we derived a prediction formula, to calculate the urine glucose concentration (C)To verify the formula, we performed a test to clarify whether our U. coli can predict and quantify the concentration of urine glucose.The presence of glucose also affects the growth curve of our U. coli compared to control, but the growth curves of 5, 15, 30 mM does not show significant difference.Proof of Concept: Differentiating diabetic urine with normalTo proof that our U. coli serves the purpose to differentiate between diabetic and normal urine samples, we calculated the average prediction interval for the fluorescent intensity in the four different glucose concentrations.After 12-hour induction with final glucose concentration of: 0, 5, 15, 30, 60 mM, the fluorescence was observed under excitation ray of 470 nm and with the filter \u0093LEE filter 019\u0094To further quantify the fluorescent intensity, and simultaneously the growth curve of U. coli, we used final glucose concentration of: 0, 5, 15, 30 mM to induce our U. coli for 8 hours with total volume of 20 ml, and measured the fluorescent intensity at excitation/emission wavelength 562 nm / 599 nm and OD600 for growth curve.Figure 3: Above is the growth curve and fluorescent intensity, the experiments were done in E. coli BL21-(DE3) in modified M9 medium, the cell were cultured in modified M9 medium for 2 hours and glucose of final concentration: 0, 5, 15, 30 mM were add to induce the expression of mRFP.In the functional test of safety circuit, the growth of U. coli with 3 hour arabinose (10 mM) induction was inhibited, even with presence of glucose (Figure 8).At time T = 101 mins with n = 84, our result shows sensitivity = 95% / specificity: 100% and if we delay the testing time to T = 120 mins, the sensitivity will be 100% (n=84), which proved that our U. coli could differentiate the diabetic urine from normal urine.To further elaborate our proof of concept, we have a statistical calculation.Proof of Concept: Prediction and Quantifying the amount of urine glucoseAfter successfully differentiating diabetic urine sample with control, we aimed to measure the amount of glucose in urine sample.To verify the function, by applying the upper limit of the 95% prediction interval of glucose negative urine sample (red) as the \u0093diabetic threshold\u0093, we performed a test to clarify whether our U. coli can differentiate diabetes from control.To measure the precise level of urine glucose, we need to look at the fluorescent intensity of mRFP.Figure 1: We induced our U. coli detection circuit with urine samples containing different glucose level and measured the fluorescent intensity kinetically at different timepoints.Characterization of glucose induced mRFP expressionWithin the preliminary test, we induced our U. coli for 12 hours to function our Detection circuit.Reuslt: with n=63, the average recovery rate is 104% (95% ~114%), which proved that our U. coli do predict and quantify the concentration of urine glucose with good precision.In conclusion, by applying this prediction formula, it shown that our U. coli could predict and quantify the concentration of urine glucose.The goal for our safety circuit is to protect our device user, and it is also an eco-environment tool.In addition, when glucose and arabinose (10 mM) both present, glucose will repress the growth inhibitory effect of arabinose, making the U. coli continue to growth.Table 1: Activation of promoter PBAD in different concentration of glucose and arabinose.Figure 8: U. coli, PBAD-RBS-lysis-TT transformed in\u00a0E. coli\u00a0BL21 (DE3), was incubated for 6 hr and transferred (1%) to modified M9 medium containing different concentrations of arabinose and glucose, and OD600 was measured kinetically by 96-well plate reader.To understand whether the higher concentration of arabinose represses the glucose-inhibited activation of PBAD, we conducted the functional test.It demonstrated a decrease of the growth of U. coli with 2-hour arabinose (40 mM) induction (Figure 9).Furthermore, the diabetic test on U-KNOW has sensitivity: 95% and specificity: 100%.Figure 4: The 95% prediction interval of glucose positive (5 mM) urine sample (green) and glucose negative (0.1 mM) urine sample (red)?the two intervals can be separated after T > 101 mins.Compared to the control group, arabinose significantly inhibited the growth of U. coli after 50 mins (time T>50 mins).Meanwhile, the U. coli with arabinose induction showed considerable low CFUs indicating the induction of lysis gene expression triggers U. coli death (Figure 10).Figure 9: Arabinose inhibited the growth of U. coli.We created well-designed prototypes to function our U. coli working in a real world.The goals for our Detection circuit are to detect and indicate the presence of urine glucose with promoter PI.When our column-by-column reading device detects arabinose in the sample, the promoter PBAD\u00a0is activated to lyse and kill the U. coli.Arabinose induce expression of the lysis gene (K117000), and then inhibit the E. coli growth and trigger the U. coli death.We characterized the relation between the glucose concentration and RFP fluorescent intensity;Furthermore, the prediction formula to quantify the amount of glucose in a urine glucose level was derived.5.Also, the efficacy of the safety circuit can be determined by measuring the growth curve and checking CFU (colony-forming units) assays.Figure 7: Schematic diagram of PBAD regulation in different concentration of glucose and arabinose.Promoter PBAD, is activated by AcaC-arabinose dimers and repressed upon the presence of

example commercially activated carbon, which has a very high and restrictive cost associated with it; this makes it far from a globally attainable solution for copper removal (Bhatnagar & Sillanpaa, 2010).Although each of these methods is successful to a degree in removing copper from water, none exist without detrimental pitfalls (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).At least two-third of all First Nation communities in Canada have been under water advisory at some time in the last decade (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015).Although these methods are generally the most economical, and low in technology costs, they all involve plant growth, which render disadvantages due to dependence on growth conditions, requirement of large-scale agricultural equipment, and knowledge, long remediation timelines and potential environmental harm due to leaching of soluble contaminants (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).It is possible to bypass this problem by using the protein YiaT anchor system designed by Han and Lee to bind and sequester copper outside the cell (2014).Furthermore, the solubility of metal hydroxides poses the problem of precipitating one heavy metal out of solution, and another back in due to their individual maximum precipitation pH\u0092s (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).Han and Lee discovered that when truncated at the arginine residue 232 (R232), the Pseudomonas lipase could be fused to the new C-terminal end of YiaT to make a functional fusion protein (2014).Currently, the removal of copper from water is accomplished through a slew of methods ranging from large-scale and industrious technologies to small-scale household friendly products.The community of Trail, BC has battled pollution from Teck Metals since 1975 (Hume 2016).The community is afflicted with contaminated landfills, slag deposits that leach into waterways and a substantial plume that has spread beneath the city and the Columbia River (Hume 2016).Particularly, Alexis Creek First Nation, Nazko First Nation and Lake Babine, all in British Columbia, have water problems spanning 16 years (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015).Our team is investigating methods of copper binding in order to contribute to the promising advancement of this remediation method.Children from the community have also demonstrated elevated levels of lead in their blood (Hume 2016).This poses a problem when attempting to use E. coli to remove heavy metals from water.Remediation of heavy metals in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems: Processes and applications.B., & Muchie, M. (2010).Although many bacteria require low concentrations of heavy metals, high levels of copper and other heavy metals can be toxic to many bacteria including E. coli.Using this anchor system, it is theoretically possible to place a copper binding protein, or any other heavy metal binding protein, to the outside of E. coli.1.Hume, M.

polycistronic B genes whose first gene codes for the LacI repressor.In daytime, polycistronic A genes will not be expressed, there will be no CI repressor to prevent the transcription of the polycistronic B genes.Thus, butyrate will be produced and the LacI repressor will repress the polycistronic A genes.The phosphoryl group will be subsequently transfered to the transcription factor OmpR, which then, will upregulate genes expressed from the POmpC promoter .In contrast, with light, PCB prevents the Cph8 autophosphorylation.OmpR will not be activated and the genes under POmpC will not be expressed.This circadian switch is further improved by integrating a NOT logic gate into the regulation circuitry.This is achieved using the phage lambda cI repressor (BBa_K1587006) as well as the bacterial LacI repressor.The genetic system has been designed to be switched on and off in response to light [2].Whitout light, Cph8 autophosphorylates its EnvZ intracellular domain while

a proper diffusion of our molecules, see more in \"Modeling\" part.The 3D printer used to construct our trap and the result of 3D printing: TrApiColiThe use of genetically modified organisms in a field associated with edible products requires to carefully consider the issues of safety, national legislation, and public opinion.In this context, we looked for a solution that would isolate our engineered bacteria from the environment, while still allowing its growth and gas diffusion.We found the solution in the iGEM Groeningen 2012 project that used a special polymer called TPX\u00ae in order to keep their bacteria from contaminating meat, their edible product.TPX\u00ae is composed of Polymethylpentene, a porous polymer, and is commercialized by the company MitsuiChemicals (4-methylpentene-1 based polyolefin, Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.).Thus, the trap was designed to be placed at the entrance of the hive, in order to act before infection and try to prevent the entry of as many mites as possible.The bees usually enter the hive by landing on the bottom board before walking inside.As in the Groeningen 2012 project, our bacteria need to be separated from the growth medium until the beekeeper decides to use the trap.Thanks to that, the trap can be easily and perfectly installed on the hive by the beekeepers without drilling or cutting.The trap was designed using Catia and then 3D printed in order to build a prototype.In order to get the best out of ApiColi in the treatment of varroosis, we designed a trap named TrApiColi.This trap could not be tested without coating because the porous plastic used for 3D printing is permeable to liquids and gases.Because of the alignment of the trap with the board, it will not disturb the bees  comings and goings.TrApiColi was thought up to take into account ethical reflection, safety and ease of use for beekeepers.Since the switch between the production of the two molecules is regulated by light, our bacteria need to be outside of the beehive.in microaerobic conditions, without agitation and miming batch culture condition), as it would be in the fieldGas diffusion tests: Permeability of butyric

these societies, living beings are held to be untouchable, it is thus necessary to comprehensively explain what synthetic biology is, what our project is, as well as what experiments we are conducting in the lab in order to give clues and keys to people having no background in this field so that we can start to have a discussion with them.It actually seems that we do not have the power to control them entirely, we can only act on a few metabolic pathways, a few functions, at the same time.When discussing the different concepts and approaches of synthetic biology, we have to take into account that ethical reflections depend on the core values of a society and thus differ from one to the other.But, as it was not in our aim to use their research to commercialize an attractive solution of Varroa destructor, we decided to base our research attractive module on the result of this US patent.We had to use a DNA construction designed by Dr Christopher Voigt from Voigt Labs, MIT.You can learn more about this in the video below.Apart from this physical containment, we were also thinking of adding to our system an auxotrophy to a specific nutriment not found in the natural environment.INSA Toulouse is a public school for engineers thus the biosafety guidelines are not specific to our institution; the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms are applied.The regulation on workers  protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No.Christianity having been predominant historically in Western Europe, it still has an influence on people\u0092s minds and a notion that could be assimilated to sin still clings to the modification of organisms.We can then ask ourselves the following questions: is it possible to have control over organisms, and if yes, to which extent?In fact, the trap we designed is in itself a first barrier, preventing the engineered bacteria from being in contact with their environment (and particularly the bees).Indeed it is often easier to trust someone when the doubts are clearly stated than when everything is allegedly under control but it cannot be verified.Before we can have any kind of ethical reflection concerning our project, we asked ourselves how to best define our \u0093work material\u0094, meaning living beings.But since regulations are different around the world, and to have a complete overview of our project, we decided to reflect on the biosafety issue, if our device were to be put in place on hives.Given that DNA is our main work tool, we decided to engage the children by letting them extract DNA from bananas, with ethanol and dishwashing soap.Add the 50ml of water(must be at ambient temperature), the salt and the Dishwashing soapIn the alcohol layer, a white cloud with bubbles should appear, this cloud is DNA!This simple yet interesting experience helped us attract children to our stand.But when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the general public and the environment.This is why we focused a big part of our energy on communicating with the public, in order to raise awareness about a worrying situation.In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures.As new interns we had to take part in a general training session to learn how to identify the risks and preventourselves and our colleagues from harm.It also informs the employee about the emergency numbers.The second one is a training about the techniques used during our stay concerning microbiological, chemical and incendiary risks.We then have a test to make sure that we were understood and aware of the previous presentations.This is the way in which one will be able to identify the barriers and the fears of the public, and understanding them is the first step to conquer them.Our project took place in a research context.In order to discuss our project with people having a first hand experience of the problem, we joined this forum.Indeed a symbiosis between man and specific bacteria is essential to its survival, and we can wonder what the impact of the modification of bacteria interacting (closely or not) with human beings will be.Anthropocentrism, which places human beings above everything and particularly above nature, is the utilitarian vision.When we first started to reach out to the public we realised that the issue of the decline in bee population was a well-known issue.That\u0092s why we met with a beekeeper (who was also a microbiologist) to discuss our project and the material restrictions we should submit to.Finally, one issue specific to our project is the fact that the small bag containing bacteria would probably have to be manipulated by beekeepers.Hence, a MTA agreement has been filled with Dr Clark Lagarias from UCDavis, so that we could obtain the strain containing the cyanobacterian light sensors from Dr Nico Claassens, Wageningen University in Netherlands.During the summer, our lab was in the engineering school INSA which possesses a safety department with one prevention advisor and several prevention assistants assigned to the laboratories.As mentioned before, ethics was a dimension that was present from the very first stages of the development of our project.Often being questioned about the fact that \u0093researchers play God by modifying living beings\u0094, and the prevailing societal distrust, we naturally developed a reflection about the possible limits to give to our project.Formerly, the field of biology matched its greek definition: bios meaning life and logos, study, biology was indeed the study of life and living beings.Finally we took the opportunity of being in Belgium to organize a quick meetup with the KU Leuven iGEM team.Overall this experience in Brussels was quite intense, we met many people interested in science and it was refreshing to be able to get out of the lab and interact with people about our project.Nevertheless the loss of a bacterial colony does not affect us emotionally in the same way the loss of a swarm does.But iGEM does not stop on the 28th of September, and we have everything planned to keep our education project alive after the competition:The \"Student s week\" occuring in several towns in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region facilitatesthe integration of new students in Toulouse by allowing them to participate in free events organized by diverseTaking place in Toulouse, Scientilivre (\"Science book\") is very rightly named and is there to present both books and scienceto the public.At the very beginning of the project, we were not at all specialists of the bees.It is obvious that we cannot let uncontrolled modified organisms disseminate in the environment.The main threat is thus the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where its DNA or RNA would be in contact with microorganisms present in the external environment.A machine is the assembly of known and controllable components, and this term seems to indicate that we assimilate a living being to a completely characterized system responding to physical and chemical laws.We also chose to place this bag in a solid device, adding yet another barrier between the bacteria and the environment.If patenting an organism were possible, it would lead us back to the perception of life as a machine, or a chemical factory, with no sense of wonder or admiration.The name Biobrick is a reminder of the Lego game and this parallel further asks the question of synthetic biology being conceived as an assembly game.We also spent a good deal of our time explaining the iGEM competition to visitors and participants alike, bringing the synthetic biology field, still quite unknown, into light.This communication experience was fully integrated to the Apicoli project, enhancing its exposure and credibility towards the public.One question leading to another, without realising it we where already giving a full guidance lecture on the choices these children would have to make in the following years (which school to attend and why, why study science, etc...).The relationship between humans and environmental bacteria is close, and even more so with the bacteria in our body.)The Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be set up in research laboratories (including containment), education, analysis, anatomy and surgical pathology, autopsy rooms, and industrial and agricultural facilities where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens.The rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (and thus in all public facilities working in scientific and technological domains) are set out in the Decree No.Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are at the heart of a long-term debate on the use of biotechnology in day-life applications.Finally, we do not aim at completely eradicating the parasite from the environment.If we focus on the human being, according to the law, his body does not belong to him, he only has a right of use.Having a first hand account from students who had to go through the same process not so long ago reassured them and gave them some perspective on their future studies.Synthetic biology is also setting off strong opposing reactions and not only because of the use of GMOs.)The main aim of this intervention was to teach children about varroa and synthetic biology while trying to spark an interest in science in general.We made sure to always check that the water-bathes were turned off at the end of the day.To manipulate into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms we used a Biological safety cabinet (FASTER \u0096 Ultrasafe).On one hand, we consider nature as fragile and in need of protection whereas on the other hand we see it as strong enough to provide all the resources we need to survive.In the previous decades or centuries, our vision of nature was more pragmatic and focused on the fulfilling of our needs.Science cannot assume that the regulation and policies of Research has to be made by scientists only, rather it is its duty to communicate the results of the researches and to have transparency on the experiments conducted.First of all, we decided to work with the E. Coli chassis, since its genome is very well characterized and it was well adapted to the molecules we wanted to produce.We also cleaned the BSC completely every two weeks.We have a dark room dedicated to the use of EtBr and UV.We talked above about the problem of controlling our modified microorganisms, and we put a lot of thought in the biocontainment issue: how could we prevent the dissemination of our E. Coli modified strain?We based the three parts (attract, eradicate and regulate)At the beginning of our brainstorming about the impact of Varroa destructor on honeybees, we found the patent US 8647615 B1 Represented By The Secretary Of Agriculture via their website.We had a very interesting exchange with the beekeepers about our project and synthetic biology in general, explaining about its principle, its interest and the practicability of our solution with the beekeepers.Our team took part in the regional ExpoSciences in Toulouse.Thus we only wish to slow down the infestation by varroa with our system, to grant honeybees enough time to adapt to the menace and reach a balance with Varroa.We also followed several other trainings that allowed us to use technical apparatus such as autoclave or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).The laboratory safety training requirements of the LISBP are detailed in the Rules and Procedures of the LISBP.Every new LISBP employee has to attend this training session regardless of its status (researcher, PhD student, intern...).The training is divided into two parts.During the summer, we had the great chance to meet and talk with a few ethicians: M. Vincent G\u00e9goire-Delory, M. Simon Desbois and Mrs Anne Cambon-Thomsen.In this case, bacteria directly died if they are in contact with the external environment.For the competition, we have to build genetic constructs called Biobricks.This specific plastic called TPX\u00ae is microporous and the size of the pores will not allow the bacteria to pass through.Being aware of the worrying decrease in bee population and having developed an ethical reflection since the beginning of this project, we endeavoured to learn more about the causes of this decrease.This happened at the end of July and our project had matured a lot thus the ExpoSciences was the occasion for us to test its welcome in the real world by exchanging with scientists.For example, if we would like to test our device on an actual hive, it would be by using the chemicals alone, and not the strain that produces them.Hence we asked ourselves the extent to which we could consider our experiments commonplace or ordinary.Our reflection on these ethical issues led us to realize that the reluctance towards the modification of living organisms could be linked to an anthropocentric vision of the world.One might ask if the importance we give to protecting bees does not have its roots in anthropocentrism since bees produce honey, wax and propolis, products we use.He offered us his collaboration, and made available his infrastructures, and his teams.Furthermore, several beekeepers from the forum \u0093La Ruche Warr\u00e9\u0094 heard about the project thanks to the same article.Everything in direct contact with something in this room has to stay there.Two specific trash cans are dedicated to the gloves or paper and the contaminated agarose gels.We have described above the relevant security measures taken all through the summer to minimize the risks of incident in the lab.This has changed in the recent years since biology today does not describe life, but rather tries to rebuild some of its important functions.This evolution induced a certain fear in societies marked by an historical creationism springing from monotheistic religions.This increased our visibility, and thanks to an article we were contacted by the Director of the \u0093Laboratoire Fran\u00e7ais d\u0092Apidologie\u0094 (French Laboratory of Apidology).Therefore the patent does not grant a property right on the biological material.That would designing a specific training for the beekeepers, and a safe way to get rid of the used bags.Another ethical issue that was raised by the concept of modifying living organisms was that of intellectual property.Thus it appears that the use the word machine is somewhat misleading, because biology is much more complicated than that.In order to protect the user, access to the NMR is not allowed for people wearing pacemakers, drug pump systems, staples on soft or hard tissue, and pregnant women.Scientists should be able to acknowledge that they don\u0092t know something rather than lying to the public.Bees, Varroas, an introduction to synthetic biology and, of course, banana DNA extraction!We prepared a short presentation about varroa which was followed by a Q and A session where student were able to interact with us and each other about the disappearance of bees, pesticides, varroa and synthetic biology.This way, the bacteria that receive the genes develop new characteristics such as resistance to an antibiotic.They helped us develop our reflexion and they also shared their knowledge with us while still having the skill to let us think by ourselves.This experience also enabled us to meet his Excellency M. Bernard Valero, the ambassador of France in Belgium, and M. Jean-Claude Guiraudon, CIRASTI President and MILSET Honorary President.Other pollinators that do not supply us with interesting goods, such as wasps, are less considered.Furthermore bees are the first pollinating species in terms of fruits and vegetables produced thus the advantages of protecting them are obvious for global trade.Indeed our system would be optimized to last at most 2 to 3 weeks, after which the bag would have to be replaced.2011-1177 is related to the use of genetically modified organisms.One for biological waste (yellow).Contrarily to what one could think, feeling fear as a scientist is essential and should not be overlooked since this is what makes us be more cautious and take a step back to study the implications of our work.Bees have an essential role as pollinators, that\u0092s why their preservation is a major social and environmental concern.We used the NMR machine that was kindly made available to us by the MetaToul platform to analyse our culture supernatant.Furthermore we tried to design a system that would be as respectful of the bee\u0092s life cycle and products as possible, hence the circadian regulation and natural molecules.Moreover the used parts are also non-pathogenic (the acids doses produced are harmless for humans).With the help of the teacher we were able to explain the basics of synthetic biology, the idea of biobricksand spark a quick debate about GMO use.The bench of the BSC was cleaned with ethanol before and after each manipulation.It is due primarily to the overuse of pesticides that have proven to act as neurotoxins to bees.In fact it seems that normality is illustrated by non living things, completely subjected to the laws of physics and chemistry, and divisible in smaller parts.Still in spite of this, most of the people interviewed weren t aware of the role played by Varroa destructor.Indeed, beeing able to use ethics at an early stage of a scientific project is not only a great opportunity but also a true advantage compared to being included in an already existing project in which you may not have time to think critically.Our project was followed by the regional newspapers (20 minutes, M\u00e9tronews, La D\u00e9p\u00eache), but also by some national magazines such as Capital or Industrie et Technologies.Though it is true that the problem first originated with men, today we cannot solve it by changing our behaviour.In this room, we are able to eat and drink (a fridge, a kettle and a coffeemaker are available) On the contrary, in the lab, we have to wear protective equipment and respect basic rules:We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals.The experience we acquired there was put to good use later and made us able to switch from a full science explanation to a simpler overview of our project without getting boring or simplistic.Indeed using synthetic biology to solve a problem attributed to a human behaviour did not seem relevant to us.When the invisible can have an impact on the visible, fear might arise.You can see here the sterility tests we realized.Another major cause of death for the bees is the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.The Decree No.Naturalists on the contrary believe that nature takes precedence over humans and must be protected from their utilization.A living being can be defined as a thermodynamic open system that receives and passes information, and is in this way a sort of \u0093anomaly\u0094 of nature since it does not tend towards entropy.Numerous products synthesized through the modification of microorganisms (reprogrammed bacteria\u0085) are currently of great significance.This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5.We further realized that the iGEM competition is the perfect moment to develop our ethical thinking.Our team had the wonderful opportunity to take part in the International ExpoSciences in Brussels.The ability to carry out this type of deliberation, to question one\u0092s own work, is what singles out a good scientist, in our opinion.Some colonies in Europe seem to start developing behaviours of the same kind.This one is taken individually with the NEO software and the explanations of the prevention assistant.This is a powerful but very expensive equipment, based on the magnetic resonance of the atoms.", "modeling": "In our case these maximum values are: Yet, we are interested in the combined effect of AHL and leucine production on the growth rate.From an optimization perspective the equation $mathbf{Sv} = 0$ represents constraints, which guide the numerical In our case the $mathbf{S}$ matrix comes from the in silico E. coli model K-12 MG1665.In our case we are interested in the leucine and AHL production rates of the type A cells and their effect on the growth rate of the bacteria.It also shows that cell A can not operate at the maximum production rate, because the growth rate would then be so slow that cell B would overgrow it.The second reaction of interest is: $$ \text{acylACP} + \text{SAM} \rightarrow \text{ACP} + \text{MTA} + \text{AHL} $$This reaction is important because AHL serves as the key to the motility system of cell B.If our promoters are too strong, the growth rate of cell A will be too low and cell B will be able to overgrow cell A.The metabolic network of the organism in question is represented as a matrix $mathbf{S}$  of size $m \times n$ .This is very important because if cell A has a big metabolic burden and thus, a very low growth rate, cell B would overgrow it and our pattern formation system would not work.To check the effect of our system on the growth rate iGEM Toulouse ran a FB analysis.Finally, the  vector $mathbf{x}$ is defined to contain the concentrations of each metabolite.Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.This is why Toulouse also modeled the effect of one biomolecule, but with the constraint that the other biomolecule is produced at maximum rate.Next  a vector $mathbf{v}$ of length $n$ is defined which contains the flux through each reaction.Here the vector $mathbf{c}$ represents a weight vector.Given this information the Toulouse team was able to locate the reactions of interest in the XML model file, and simulate the cell metabolism.This is something to keep in mind when we choose our promoters for the system.Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.This is the flux that corresponds to a growth rate of 0.This matrix is filled with the stoichiometric constants of each reaction.In generally it follows from the analysis that the more AHL or leucine is produced the smaller the biomass output becomes.The steady state solution Which is the nullspace of $mathbf{S}$.We see that the production values are way smaller in this simulation.We cooperated with Toulouse on the modeling.Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.Each of the $m$ matrix rows represents a unique compound.", "notebook": "This successful event was a good opportunity for us to start learning how to design a poster and to communicate about synthetic biology.We held our first meeting without instructors to discuss the design of the constructions needed to create the engineered bacteria.The butyrate genes were cloned into the PL-LacI-ccr pUC57 Plasmid.Blandine took part to iGEM meetup France organized by iGEM Bordeaux Team, where she met different teams, discussing with them, and presenting our project.To do so we designed a booklet explaining our project and what iGEM is.We first started searching for genes that we would like to have in our constructions on the iGEM registry.After we successfully designed our construct we started thinking about what our device would look like.How does the competition works and what are the important deadlines?Those presentations gave us the opportunity to understand more about the iGEM competition and to get to know each other (since we don\u0092t all come from the same institutions).First team meeting, our instructors informed us on the competition more specifically and how the team is organized.Here are few examples of projects reviewed: Our youngest instructor and team mother Mathilde B\u00e9raud went with Beno\u00eet Pons to the FSIE committee, and thanks to their intervention, we obtained \u0080 4000 !Start again for the ones that did not work...The first cloning worked for the final construction: a first step has been completed (the formate genes were cloned into the PL-CI pUC57 plasmid).We could now begin the genetic construction, but we faced a problem with the vectors: receptors genes were cloned into vectors incompatible with our final construction plan, so we had to look for an alternative solution.Thomas and M\u00e9lany worked together on the attraction module: production of butyrate We received our synthetic genes after more than one month of waiting for them.Another good news was the success of the first steps of the circadian cloning made by Beno\u00eet Pons Blandine, who created our Ulule account (Ulule is a crowdfunding platform) informed us that it was a real success.They presented a poster on synthetic biology and the iGEM competition.Anthony met Felix from iGEM Stockholm Team, and discussed about the iGEM experience, all the work done at this moment, his disappointments, \u0085 He understood that all iGEM teams were in the same situation: URGENCY.Even if the experiments did not work as expected, all the team smiles again when we received our polo shirts and berets that we will wear in Boston: we are ready to fight !We chose to implement  a circadian rhythm cycle which would allow us to produce toxic molecules during the night when bees are a lot less active.We Skyped with the iGEM Ankara team which is also working on Varroa destructor.We are eager to start, but are a bit pessimistic about the next phase of the project.Two members of our team participated in the Toulouse Exposciences.Indeed, we wanted to combine our efforts to fight against varroa and to gather some data about the mite.Now the real fight begins, hoping to achieve that we planed.The synthetic genes, which were cloned into pUC57 vectors, were amplified and then cloned during the weekend.All the team is now waiting for the synthetic genes and training since the 26th of June.Our reflection led us to the conclusion that our construction should respect the bee life cycle.Two projects were still in course to be chosen, the use of ice nucleating proteins to purify water and the creation of a  bio trap against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.Our first mission was to prepare a presentation for the next week on the following themes:Previous subjects.Following the newspaper articles published we discovered a forum of beekeepers discussing about our project on the web.We realised that our the cloning part would be quite long because of the number of genes needed to obtain... We therefore decided to order synthetic sequences for our synthetic pathway constructions.Laetitia Chaumont, Benoit Pons and Mathilde Beraud went to a laboratory studying varroa(Vacbio EA 4357).Nonetheless, good mood of the team!the bacteria should not produce both attractive and toxic molecules at the same time.This last one was chosen to be our project on the grounds that it  was the most feasible.Every group of two or three students presented one of the subjects seen above.The formate genes (pflA and pflB), the butyrate genes without ccr and the POmpC-LacI box-CI were cloned into pSB1C3.Based on bibliography, the initial idea was to build an engineered bacteria which will have to produce butyrate to attract the parasite.In order to achieve this, Valentin Girin used the software Catia for the modeling of our device.Culture tests were realized for different concentrations of the Biosilta medium.Therefore, we decided to set up a more optimised protocol to assess the attraction of varroa by butyrate.We finished the design of our constructions and send it to our instructors for checking.The production of formic acid in the culture of the producing strain was followed.During the whole week we searched for ways to produce our molecules cyclically.Those results are directly linked to the undergoing cytotoxicity tests.We also initiated the creation of the plans that would be used to 3D print our device.We did cloning trainings to be as efficient as possible, Beno\u00eet Pons and Marine Pons succeeded the first cloning at the first attempt !!We also learned more about the beekeeping activity and the treatments used to fight against the parasite.Laetitia Chaumont obtained a meeting with Vincent Gr\u00e9goire Delory, the ethician of Toulouse White Biotechnology (TWB).Since our bacteria needed to perceive red light we decided to place our device at the entry of the hive but outside.Moreover, it was time to choose attributions to make the project management easier, below in the table, the main assignments.The following weeks were the subject of extensive researches on the topic.They were pleasantly surprised that we took the time to answer all their questions!We prepared some M9 medium, and also did a cytotoxicity test of formic acid thanks to a plate reader.An enzymatic test was done on the Biosilta kit with an OD reading, until the stabilization of bacterial growth.Melissa David, Melany Tanchon and Louise Gody went to Brussels to attend the international Exposciences for the whole week.No doubt, this is the final effort before the dreadful wikifreeze !!The presentations were divided in the following parts.The following weeks were spent brainstorming.During this period, we were informed by iGEM toulouse instructors of what this competition is, and what was expected of us.Strong headaches and itching eyes but still on the computer ?Fighting with HTML tags and continuously looking at the clock ?We received from Dr Nico Claasens lab (Wageningen University) the strains containing PCB en Cph8 vectors responsible for the circadian regulation.However two parameters had to be improved because butyrate is a very volatile molecule and we conducted experiments in a petri dish thus diffusion complicated the interpretation.!We did a cytotoxicity test of butyric acid and we were trained to be able to use the NMR machine.There is only one month left and we have to work harder to reach project goals.We realised two tests: one is a test culture on BW25113 strain under aerobic and micro aerobic conditions.The next step was to present every week, two new project ideas.", "protocol": "At the end of first pipe put a sterile cone and immerse it into Eppendorf with NaHCO3After 24 hours culture, press 10 mL syringe in order to expel gas in NaHCO3 solutionNote 1: We used culture in M9 because with the \u0093Acids production tests\u0094 we had data on this medium.Note 2: 10 mM NaHCO3 solution was used

measure OD505 nmPlot glucose concentration in function of OD505nm and determine the linear region In order to test if E. coli produces formic acid and butyric acid with genes added, we made culture test with modified bacteria.The only change is that no filters were used because the sterility is not necessary.Close the small bag via fusing machine and Put the closed small bag in a Steril laboratory flaskPositive Control: Inoculate a culture tube at OD600 nm = 0.1 in LB medium (Final Volume = 20 mL)2.When varroa heads for one side of Glass T tube and covers more than 2 cm test is over and we write down the side choosen by varroa (Butyric acid or Water)treatment they place a diffuser at the top of the hive and formic acid concentration As gas concentration is difficult to evaluate

order to have varroas in the same phase it is necessary to add one step and it is important for reproducibility of theexperiments.For butyric acid, the concentration chosen 4 % (V/V) because this is the concentration used in the patent quoted (see \u0093Attribution\u0094 part).We used water as a negative control.For this test we use varroas directly from frames because we did not have enough standardized varroas.Tap on Petri dish and see if varroa moves.We used the same protocol as \u0093Culture on Erlenmeyers and TubeSpin\u00ae Bioreactors\u0094 with some changes: The objective of our

the length of the PCR products, and to the melting temperature Tm of the primers.With this method we place varroas on adult bees so all varroas will be in phoretic phase.With small brush take varroas

step lasts 1 min for PCR products up to 2 kb.To simplify calculation we noted down formic acid A.We chose a positive control with a higher concentration, 2 mol.L-1, and then decreasing concentration in order to identify which minimum concentration could kill varroa.In the beginning we tested high and low concentrations and we further adapted the concentrations.Resuspend cells in 2 mL of ice-cold TFB2 with gentle re-pipetting.", "result": "Our results were in line with our objective to produce acids in a microporous bag because we demonstrated that with microaerobic conditions, To convert the concentration of formate into formic acid we used the famous Henderson Hasselbalch equation:As mentioned in the Eradicate part, our goal was to produce 50 \u00b5M of formic acid to kill varroa, and this corresponds to 77,7 mM of formate.Under our microaerobic conditions, the wild type E. coli strain produced 32 mM of formate.Aerobic conditions were obtained with a classical Erlenmeyer incubated at 37 \u00b0C with agitation.We used a minimal M9 medium to identify formic or butyric acid production by NMR.Aim: to measure formate production of wild-type strains in microaerobic conditionsIn order to plot biomass concentration we converted the OD values with the following equation:Substrate and products concentration was inferred from the peak area of each molecule on the NMR spectrum.Butyrate production from this pathway remains to be demonstrated prior to testing the strain with varroas.In order to determinate the amount of formic acid required to kill the mite, we tested different concentrations of formic acid on varroas as explained in the Protocol part.Figure 5: Mortality of varroas as a function of time for different formic acid concentrationsFigure 6: Histogram representing mortality of varroas after 2 hours and after 7 hoursFigure 7 presents a dose-dependency of formic acid on varroa mortality.In order to quantify the production of butyrate and formate in these conditions, we  first performed a test with a high concentration of the enzyme (50 U/L) and measured the kinetics of the polymer degradation.Figure 23: Kinetics of Biosilta polymer degradation measured with glucose release.The modeling suggests that concentration the Biosilta medium should even improve formate and butyrate productions but the experimental validation of this production has shown that this is not compatible with E. coli growth.In order to measure BW25113 resistance to different acids concentrations we tested two medium: LB and M9 with 15 mM glucose.For a perfect regulation it would have been necessary to delete the chromosomic version Conclusion: the wild type E. coli strain produces formate in microaerobic conditions but production has to be further improvedAs explained here calculation of the survival of bacteria was perfomed via colony counting after plating on solid agar medium.In order to characterize the E. coli strain growth in the conditions we plan to use in our device, we used a culture under aerobic and micro-aerobic conditions, measured the growth rate (OD) and analyzed the supernatant to measure the concentration of fermentation products.Using a more porous plastic Conclusion: formate permeates through the TPX\u00ae while butyrate exchange will need to be improvedThe bacteria impermeability of the TPX\u00ae was tested through inoculation of the strain  E. coli BW 25113 in M9 defined medium complemented with glucose inside the bag.As explained in the \"Results\" part, \"attract\" section, our objective was to produce at least 0.00001%, so the modelling indicates that we can theoretically reach it.Nevertheless, in order to have this glucose release production, it was necessary to calculate Knowing that one Biosilta kit contains the equivalence of 13 g/L of glucose, we should therefore concentrate the medium 7 times.Thus, we tested different concentrations of Biosilta medium with different enzyme concentrations.Conclusion: Biosilta medium has to be used in a more concentrated manner to reach our growth objectives.Aim: to determine if we can concentrate Biosilta medium to improve the concentration of fermentation products.We do not have the exact composition of Biosilta medium and cannot ascertain innocuity of higher titers of the polymer on growth.In order to model production in the most similar conditions to fit real experiment we chose a glucose rate of 0.0403 g.L-1.h-1 that correspond to 0.72 U/L of enzyme.To convert formate production into formic acid concentration we used equation (3).Thus, to build a biobrick with the full pathway, we cloned the ccr gene with all the genes necessary for butyrate production, as presented below: Figure 2: assembly of the synthetic pathway leading to butyrate production (5192 Kb).On a first assay, we did not detect any permeation of butyric acid through the TPX\u00ae bag.We hypothesized that in presence of a carbon source, we may be able to extend even further their survival time period.Figure 22: Bacteria survival test performed with the BW25113 strain on M9 with 15 mM of glucose during 15 days.The cylinder on the left contains the TPX\u00ae bag with E. coli BW 25113 immersed in M9 medium after 27 hours of growth at 37 \u00b0C.Test of two conditions: without enzyme and with [Enzyme] = 0.72 U/L Figure 25 (right panel) shows that the polymer is not degraded by E. coli which is probably capable of finding another carbon source within the Biosilta medium.Aim: modeling the production of formic and butyric acids as a function of the glucose release rates.We tested our genetic construction in the E. coli strain BW25113 but we did not detect butyrate production.Growth was visualy assessed in the bags after 17 hours at 37\u00b0C (figure 14), or with a culture in tube with agitation as a control over the same period (figure 15).Culture of E. coli BW25113 in M9 medium with [glucose] = 15 mM, at 37 \u00b0CGlucose was consumed approximately at the same rate for both conditions but was converted differently depending on the condition.Shortly, a solution of butyrate or formate was placed in the TPX\u00ae bag.To improve the production of butyrate, we repeated the experiment in a strain with a deletion of the phosphate acetyltransferase gene.of the first DNA fragment matches 5192 pb (butyrate construction) and the size of the second one (2070 pb) matches linearized pSB1C3.In order to test butyrate production, we cultivated ApiColi under micro-aerobic conditions to simulate the growth conditions in the device.Thus, the strain E. coli BW 25113 has been inoculated in a small bag that was sealed.According to the modelling results described in figure 28, we have to produce around 100\u00b5mol/L of butyric acid that corresponds to 0.0092% (V/V).Conclusion: The synthetic formate operon is ready to be used in E. coli and sent to the registryFor formate production, we designed a synthetic polycistron coding for pyruvate formate lyase and its activator protein.Culture under micro-aerobic conditions in 10 mL falcon, result obtained after 28.5 hours of culture.Unfortunately we could not detect butyric acid in our NMR analysis, but we observed significant differences for other fermentation products, proving that the synthetic pathway is actually interfering with the fermentation products metabolism.Figure 27: Modelling formic acid production as a function of glucose release for different growth rates (in h-1).Figure 8: assembly of the synthetic pathway leading to formate production (3090 Kb).Figure 33: pH of the two media in function of the concentration of formic acid and butyric acid.As a first step to develop our regulation module, we replaced the butyrate pathway by the RFP reporter gene and the formate pathway by GFP reporter gene.Each condition was tested three times.It is clear that in M9 medium the pH remains at pH 7 at high acid concentrations but not in the LB medium.Optimizing this production will have to be achieved before testing the strain capacity to kill varroas.We want to express the butyrate synthetic pathway by day and the formate synthetic pathway by night.On the right, the negative control cylinder contains a bag of TPX\u00ae without bacteria after 27 hours of growth at 37 \u00b0C.We then assessed the biomass evolution during long term growth in the TPX\u00ae bag (7 to 10 days).We then made a biobrick by subcloning the polycistron in the pSB1C3 plasmid (BBa_K1587007).Figure 9: extracellular substrate and product concentrations with or without formate polycistron overexpression under micro-aerobic conditions.Figure 9 shows that the only difference between ApiColi and the control is in the formate accumulation, so we plotted the specific histogram for formate after 3 days (Figure 10).Over this time, no growth was detected in the medium surrounding the plastic bag.For our system to be efficient, it was necessary to check that butyrate and formate could permeate through the TPX\u00ae bag.Hence, we used the mentioned 4 % butyric acid concentration, like the one first mentioned in the patent.Figure 28: Modelling of butyric acid production as a function of glucose release for different growth rates.We observed a maximal formate concentration of 25mM (Figure 9).Therefore our production level is not far from the target.We then checked the viability of the cells after 10 days of growth in the TPX\u00ae bag (tube 1, 1  and 2) or in the control tube (tube 3), by spreading diluted volume of the cultures on Petri plates.For the formic acid, we were able to detect it in the gas, probably because its pKa is lower than the butyric acid one.The cph8 biobrick was not obtained but we managed to build a biobrick (BBa_K1587008) with the cph8 encoding sequence under the control of a strong promoter originated from the biobrick (BBa_J23119).In order to have a global idea of the release of glucose per unit of time we then calculated the average rate of release with the following formula:the rate of glucose release necessary to have glucose during 13 days can be calculated with the following formula.Conclusion: It is possible with a Bio Silta Kit to have a continuous release of glucose for 13 days only the one calculated previously.Figure 26: Modeling of formic acid production as a function of different growth rates for a glucose release of 0.0403 g.L-1.h-1.Moreover, it would consume less glucose per hour so we would need a lower polymer concentration in our bag at the beginning.We hypothesized that by deleting the various production pathways for lactate, acetate and ethanol and the degradation pathway forConclusion: Fermentation products concentration can be improved with the enzymatic degradation of the Biosilta polymer.Choice of the carbon source to sustain formic and butyric acids production during 10 days24 hours.This technology is based on polymer degradation by an depolymerisation enzyme leading to a perfect control of the quantity of substrate released in the medium for a given period of time.At 10mM formic acid, all varroas died before three hours but as we explained in the Protocol part, varroas also stop moving at lesser concentrations.In the US patent US 8647615 B1, the concentration of butyric acid that attracts varroa mites is 4 % (V/V), but the final description specified the concentration is efficient from 0.00001 %.However, in the Cytotoxicity part of the results, we also showed that this 4% concentration is lethal for bacteria.Acquisition of the growth stopped due to a problem with the plate reading system where the bacteria where growing.Each condition is tested in three replicates and standard deviation is represented in orange.In M9 medium, the growth is slower at the beginning of the growth curve, however the maximum value of OD reached is almost the same for both medium.The concentration of products (left panel) is clearly different in the two conditions: with the enzyme, more fermentation products are formed.Fermentation products have high concentrations in comparison to the cultures in performed in M9 (15 mM glucose), around 20 times more for lactate, 3 times more for acetate and 2 times more for ethanol.These genes were amplified by PCR and subcloned in pSB1C3 (at this step, a RBS was added to sequence during the PCR).The molecules exchanged between the bag and the surrounding air were desorbed in a solution of sodium bicarbonate.Our final objective was to prepare a bag containing bacteria producing alternatively butyric acid (during the day)and formic acid (during the night) and for a period of time of at least ten days (so that beekeepers don t have to change them every morning...).Doing so, it should be easy to assess the functioning of the light sensor and the NOT logic gate since the colonies should be red by day and green by night.To do so, we synthesized the pOMPC-cI gene (new biobrick BBa_K1587006)Through subcloning the GFP reporter gene (BBa_E0240) was placed under control of this promoter.Except for the 1.5 U/L enzyme concentration, there was an increase of OD in all conditions during 12 days.Culture with BW25113 on 48 wells plate and optical readerFrom these three figures it is evident that we cannot reach the growth level that is expected and that concentrated Biosilta is actually detrimental to growth.Conclusion: concentrating the Biosilta medium is not compatible with E. coli growth.The Biosilta medium was successfully used to have a continuous release of glucose over two weeks.The culture tube contains bacteria growing in parallel of the biological sample tubes shown above (t = 17 hours, 37 \u00b0C, 130 rpm).Additional experiments will be needed to go further (test of our enzymes expression, measurements of intracellular pools to identify metabolic locks, growth at other pH, deletions to prevent the accumulation of other fermentation products as explained in [1]...).Conclusion: butyrate production has to be improved in our strain and under our conditions Butyrate is an effective attractant for varroas.Therefore, formic acid permeats through the TPX plastic.Figure 29: Bacteria growth as a function of time for different concentrations of Biosilta medium.Thus, we only had to clone the synthesized genes into pSB1C3 to be sent to the iGEM registry.At the time of this test, there were not a lot of varroas available, so we add to make only one test in order to hope a significant result.We investigated if the bacteria could grow inside a small bag of TPX\u00ae.OD600 nm served to monitor a putative growth in the external medium.Figure 15: Control of figure 14 with a growth test of E. coli BW 25113 in a culture tube.We concluded that the bacteria are contained in the bag.The growth tendency is toward a continous increase over the experiment time.This strain produces lower amount of acetate, a fermentation product which production is likely to compete with butyrate.Figure 4: Test of butyrate production in E. coli strain deleted for pta gene.After 2 days and until the end, the growth rate changes gradually and becomes constant, at the highest between 2 and 4 days and decreasing thereafter.With the rate of glucose release calculated above, an FBA and FVA simulation were launched as explained in Modeling part.We will now see if buffering our medium has a positive action on growth.Butyric and formic acids production does not stop the growth within our targeted ranges of concentrations.The same experiment was therefore performed by placing directly the bag in the solution of sodium bicarbonate.After having harvested the supernatant of the culture, we filtrated it prior to do NMR analysis.Similar numbers of colonies were obtained, indicating that the cells survival is the same in both culture conditions.to pass outside the bag in the gas phase.Moreover we now know that bacteria do not grow when the pH is around 5.The first arrow represents the promoter, the others represent genes.The first arrow represents the promoter, the others represent genes.There is a visible difference between the two culture media.This showed that the cells were able to proliferate in the plastic bag.Some conversion between the model and the real condition are necessary and they are also explained there.We did not succeed in associating the three genes together behind a strong promoter in pSB1C3 using the In Fusion cloning technique before the iGEM deadline.This phase was therefore not the one to analyse.Both constructions were placed together on the same plasmid but unfortunately sequencing revealed that there was some incoherence in the RFP sequence, preventing further testing.For our project we need to implement a light sensor system in our strain.Figure 14: Growth test of E. coli BW 25113 inside a small bag of TPX\u00ae.to analyse the products and the evolution of the polymer quantity.Likewise, the RFP reporter gene (BBa_K081014) was cloned behind the PL-lacI synthetic gene.This construction (BBa_K1587007) was inserted in the plasmid pSB1C3 to be provided to the iGEM in the biobrick format.", "safety": "", "keywords": "polycistronic chromoprotein standardized expression antibiotic antibiotics beekeepers inhibition spectrophotometer

the way into the future: Space Physics and Synthetic Biology.We have actively been in touch with media, in order to spread the idea of Synthetic Biology to the general public, which is a large part of what makes this competition important.Lastly, we also do collaborations because it is fun!In our project, Biology and Astrophysics are closely intertwined, and as such both disciplines are needed to successfully apply Synthetic Biology to a Mars expedition.We feel that different backgrounds all bring something of value to the table, which is greater than the sum of its parts.Collaboration with other iGEM teams, universities and media has also been one of our focus points.Traditionally, many iGEM teams have been composed of a large majority of people with a biological background.However,

emission.While these results are not conclusive, they suggest a slight increase in the survivability of transformed moss after being frozen at -20*c and -60*c. This increase in survivability could be due to the UNIK antifreeze gene.The transformed moss was able to grow from protoplasts to full clumps on media containing Kanamycin (50 mg/ml), which suggests that the nptII-resistance cassette provides P. Patens with resistance to Kanamycin.To further validate this, an additional experiment were outlined where WT moss was grown on either non-selective PhyB-media (3 plates) or PhyB-media containing Kanamycin 50 mg/ml (3 plates).While the presence of YFP in the transformed antifreeze moss suggest expression of the antifreeze protein, the question remains if the antifreeze protein improves the moss ability to survive cold temperatures.To answer this question, we filled our self designed PhyscoFreezer (see Red lab for more information) with dry ice and put a plate containing 3 transformed clumps of P.patens and a plate of WT moss straight down into the dry ice.A) Moss transformed with the UNIK antifreeze gene 2 days after being frozen.B and C) Moss transformed with the UNIK antifreeze gene 7 days after being frozen.A few days after transformation the moss protoplasts was observed under a fluorescent microscope and YFP-expression was visible in moss protoplasts for the antifreeze and the STS construct (fig.3) YFP filter with 500/20 excitation and 535/30 emission.The transformed moss protoplasts were then moved to PhyB-plates containing Kanamycin (50 mg/ml) and were left to grow for a few weeks.This is a stark contrast to the transformed moss that was able to grow from protoplasts to full clumps and the more vibrant WT moss grown on nonselective media (fig.A) A moss protoplast transformed with the antifreeze construct.No such peak is present for WT or transformed STS moss samples (red, purple lines).The first moss transformation confirmed the function of the Zea Mays ubiquitin promoter (ZmUbi) since YFP was present in the transformed moss protoplasts.This suggests that resveratrol is not produced in the transformed moss.The WT moss planted on Kanamycin containing plates grew very little or not at all and is seen under the microscope as withering (fig.First, the wild type moss clumps looked amorphous and with the rhizoids in a collapsed mass (fig.However, the LC-MS machine was not able to detect resveratrol in the 3 STS transformed moss samples.The same bright autofluorescence and green colour was not observed for the frozen WT moss.This suggests that part of the antifreeze moss was still alive.3 A1), while the antifreeze moss clumps seemed to have conserved their structure.Photo taken 8 days after the moss was planted.The moss protoplasts transformed with the STS-construct were left to grow for 6 weeks.2 days after, strong autofluorescence was observed in one clump of antifreeze moss but not in WT (fig.B) A moss protoplast transformed with our STS construct.From around the time we started in the laboratory, we spent a lot of time just optimizing the PCR reactions for Piece A and C. Not only was it hard to just get a band on the gel, it was also difficult to amplify a high enough amount of each piece, since you need 30 ug of DNA total for our moss transformation protocol.Figure 2: A clump of antifreeze transformed P.Patens showing YFP-expression grown on Kanamycin containing plates (50 mg/ml).C) A moss protoplast transformed with a vector expressing YFP.We also took 3 equal sized clumps of WT moss and put them on new PhyB-media.After 7 days both WT and antifreeze moss looked brown and withered.It demonstrated that the gene construct design works and that moss can combine different DNA pieces with matching overhangs using homologous recombination.We imagine that future teams can do experiments with our antifreeze moss and/or do additional transformations with our lines, to make them even more adapted to the martian environment.100% methanol was used for extraction and both WT moss as a negative control and transformed moss was extracted.One month after transformation, there was ten growing clumps of antifreeze transformed moss.B) Wild type moss grown on kanamycin containing plates (50 mg/ml).B) WT moss 2 days after being frozen.A) WT moss 7 days after being frozen.Secondly, what seems to be cells still containing living chloroplasts were observed on one of the antifreeze clumps.A) Wild type moss on media without kanamycin.This confirms that the transformation was a success and highly suggests that the genes of interest - antifreeze and STS - are expressed.C) Wild type moss without kanamycin on top and with kanamycin on bottem.A peak corresponding to resveratrol without a hydrogen atom 227,1 g/mol, is seen on the standard (fig.The next day the PhyscoFreezer still contained dry ice and we replated our transformed on moss on new PhyB-media.White arrowheads indicate green colour or autofluorescence D) WT moss that has not been frozen.Unfortunately, the ZmUbi promoter sequence had four illegal restriction sites towards the 3  end, which prevented it from being added to the registry as a biobrick.Seven of those clumps of moss were expressing YFP (fig.After transformation of moss protoplasts no transformants expressing YFP was observed.After 6 weeks the protoplasts had grown into small moss clumps.This suggests stable integration of the antifreeze gene construct.It is therefore unlikely that the promoter works without the 3  part, even though single transformants may have been missed under the microscope.Doing PCRs can be surprisingly hard.After 7 days, there was a visible difference in growth between WT on non-selective media and WT on Kanamycin plates (fig.We would then try to verify the promoters function without the 3  end sequence with the illegal restriction sites.", "safety": "This means that work is restricted to genetically modified microorganisms and/or cell cultures, which are not suspected to be pathogenic to humans.Thus our main concerns are to the preserve the natural ecosystem and minimize the risk of spreading transgenic moss into the wild.Our team followed a lab tour concerning the biosafety in the lab provided by experienced laboratory technician Britta Hamberger.We have therefore taken certain precautions in the lab to avoid this worst case scenario as we are working with a GMO after all.The aim of the Treaty is to prevent forward and back contamination during a

Biosafety at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) held by the DTU iGEM team.We have transformed Physcomitrella Patens with genes from grapes and a worm.The Resveratrol gene from grapes would most likely not be beneficial for the wildtype moss if it was released back into the wild.The slightly rarer case would be back contamination, which is the risk of bringing unknown lifeforms - if they do exist - back to earth.Biosafety is the prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins and their accidental release, which is important when dealing with gene modified organisms (GMOs).At the workshop we also developed our knowledge in lab safety procedures and we got familiarized with PCR, cloning and transformation.Before the workshop every team member had to complete a short safety quiz that allowed us to evaluate our knowledge.We do not know the implication the release of the modified moss could have on the natural ecosystem.Forward contamination is the contamination of a celestial object by organisms from earth that may have contaminated the spacecraft on the way to the object.Because GMOs are organisms that are not naturally encountered in the environment their

habits of feeding each other to achieve the effect of prevention and treatment of disease.Then we want to know whether the E. coli we add will have effects on honey quality and safety ?A: Actually, unprocessed honey contains various active microbes, such as yeast, E. coli and other bacteria.Do you have any ideas or suggestions for our two programs ?A:The program of import suicide gene in E. coli ,effect of suicide gene may not be as good as that in theory, in the end it may not effectively solve the security problems .So it remains to be confirmed,which you need to do experimental test .In addition, E. coli is not the dominant bacteria in honey, so basically you can not consider security issues.Q: If we made gene medicine products, compared with traditional chemical drugs in the market what are our competitive advantages?A: Your generic drugs can effectively treat CSBV and has small food safety risks to human as opposed to the traditional hazards of drugs on security issues.What is the traditional method we have to control this disease and what are the advantages of our technology?A:In early times this virus is very serious indeed, resulting in enormous loss of bees .Yeast program sounds good, but I did not study in this regard, I can not give you any advice.Q:Our idea is to make this technology into patents and product, we want to hear your views and suggestions on our industrial prospects of this technology.A:Now there is no direct treatment to the virus, if the RNA interference technology is successful, I think the outlook is still very good.One of the biggest problems is that we used E. coli to be the carrier, but we feared that these E. coli is a potential pathogen, resulting in intestinal infections and other diseases.Next we started the interview.Q:According to reports, the number of bees is now declining every year.But we do not know the accurate reasons for it.We would like to ask your views on this matter, as well as the impact on the apiculture in China?A:Yes, this problem is more serious in Europe and America.And we believe that in their future, the principle of playing will have a long-lasting effect in many aspects of their life.Professor Susong Kun:He was awarded Special Economic Animals (including Silkworm, Honeybees) PhD by Zhejiang University .Now he is the vice president of bee faculty in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University and he is Professor, doctoral tutor; positions bee scientist of modern industrial technology system , \"Minjiang scholar\" Professor; Deputy Secretary-General of China Institute of beekeeping, executive director of China Institute of beekeeping bee biology,deputy director of the professional Committee of three bee breeding, vice president and the Secretary-General of apiculture Zhejiang Association.These factors make China has not been a big impact.A:The reason for this problem is unknow , I think the reason is multifaceted and comprehensive.But now with the improvement of beekeeping technologies, as well as taking into account the impact of drugs on product quality .We seldom use the drugs.A: Because the disease first breaks out in the general body of the bee larvae but he impact on adult bees are relatively small.Such as environmental factors, electromagnetic, viruses, pesticides, etc., it is a common effect of these factors make reduction in the number of bees.While the population of Chinese bees is relatively small and product less honey.So people seldom farm them.These factors slowly caused the population of Italian bee rapidly expanding.However, the relative reduction was in Chinese bees population.To remove the barrier between science and normal people\u0092s life, It is our responsibility to lead people into the wonderland of science.But most important of all, we actually have a common philosophy\u0097\u0097Playing is the best way of learning.It began from April this year with high Infectiousness and spread fast and strong.This disease is so difficult to cure that it resulted in economic loss.A:If this disease outbroke more serious in the past , then they could only be used some illicit chemicals to combat, such as oxytetracycline.Oxytetracycline is the most widely used medicine in China for it\u0092s cheap and effective, but it can not be guaranteed that there will be no infection.Where a large number of use of pesticides will be a very important affecting factor.Q:We aim to cure Sacbrood disease which is caused by Chinese Sacbrood Virus.If it is put into the market, it will certainly have a incomparable advantages with other drugs.During the activity, we taught them everything we know about honeybees, and they did show a great interest in the small charming creature.We taught them the structure of honeybees and they were required to use a way they want to show us what they have learned.We aimed to inspire their interest in science, and make it clear that they all have a talent of doing science, for they all have a talent of playing and learning.Fanshu Park gave us a few training so that we know how to deal with kids, besides they helped us organized ten children and provided us an activity space and facilities needed.In 28th of August, we held an half-day activity.For this, we want to hear your views and suggestions?A:E.coli is indeed harmful and you also relates to a transgenic.So security of products in question must be paid attention to.Then we tried to spread the idea that everyone has the potential to be scientist as long as being offered an opportunity.And the discussion is, who cares?We successfully taught them the how to play correctly and scientifically by doing this way.After all, the honey will be marketed, and goes to public.This part may be a bit dull for kids, but when they were required to distinguish out real honey from fakes on their own, it seemed rather practical instead.To illustrate that everyone has a potential of being a scientist, or a engineer, we helped them to design their own project.Some kids tried to draw a picture of honeybee and some even tried to made a shape of honeybee by using plasticene.We also taught them the difference between real honey and fakes, so that in future they won\u0092t make a terrible purchase.Instead of giving a dull lesson about biology, this year FAFU-China decided to teach children how to play correctly, how to play with principles from science, and finally they will find their own way to science.We cooperated with a semi-profit social organization Fanshu Park.If we add rules to play, we have a game which is actually what project is.But beekeepers have trained that two boxes of bees from the perspective of disease resistance, thanks to resistance to disease, and that two boxes of bees now develop into hundreds of boxes.Then we told him about the project and the process of experiment.But before that there are several issues you need to address, the first one is the safety of the products , this was just been mentioned before.This technique is equivalent to cure from the root , more direct thorough.Q:In the experiment, we paid special attention to bio-safety issues.Second, the quality honey which is sterilized will decline.Most of these drugs are expensive but the effect is good, so it has become a choice for traditional beekeepers.So if you can effectively solve these problems, it will be promising.A: Nowadays most bees Chinese beekeepers raise are Italian bees.The final prices of product and costs are also important issues, if you can solve these problems, I think it will be a dramatic product in apiculture.Expectancy is what do you think the answer for the question would be.But you have to take into account the cost and the use of generic drugs.The reason may be the unique Chinese bees followed by domestic beekeeping long history and rich experience.Over the past 4 years, Fanshu Park has successfully explored a new field in Fuzhou city and organized a bunch of children and parents on it\u0092s back.The second one is the effect of the product, you must reach a certain level of effect.Part of the reason is that they are very experienced with holding activities for children.But for China, the problem is not that serious.But this time, we need some innovations, perhaps some funs too.Play is not only a simple process.Because now through artificial breeding, we have been able to reduce the harm caused by CSBV, so your products must have a better result.You\u0092ll know that play provides everything you need in oder to be a scientist, and that is what motivates us.First, because the honey itself contains a certain amount of lysozyme, it has a bactericidal effect.", "design": "This is the easiest way we design for the usage of our product.Next add 5ml bacterial suspension of engineered bacteria into the forage, limiting the density under 1CFU/ml, which is within the standard of food security.Then you have the complete product.Beekeepers who don t know anything about synthetic biology can use this product simply by directly feeding infected hives with the product.Now we have the easiest forage for honeybees.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Immediately, we began to do double enzyme digestion(EcoR1/Xho1?EcoR1/Pst1).After gel recovery, we linked our target fragments to relative vectors with T4 ligase, 4?, overnight.Meanwhile, we collected data about the index of the condition of swarms again, which was used to analyze the effect of dsRdRp by Excel later.Pinking the positive colonies, PCR detection, and then plasmid extraction.Since now, we will obverse the change of population of them, the mortality, and the number of sealed brood and collect data every weeks until we get the obvious result.Considering we have not gotten RdRp-pSB1C3 yet,we decided to link T7 RNAP gene to pSB1C3 first.Anyway we would do it again tomorrow.On the one hand, we still could not link RdRp with pSB1C3 so that there still nothing on the plate.According to the result, we found that dsRdRp made a remarkable influence on the replication of CSBV.It was used as engineering bacteria for expressing dsRdRp.Also, considering the biosecurity of E.coli, we decided use yeast as the final transformation target.The expression quantity of RdRp gene declined either, which meant that dsRdRp really could inhibit the replication of CSBV.Even though we were succeed in using dsRdRp expressed in proeukaryotic system to prevent and cure CSBV, we still had to take care of some problem we met.We wonder if it was because of the efficiency of ligase or anything.On the other hand,we prepared another competent cell,HT115,which included T7 RNAP gene in its genome.Although the concentration of the plasmid was a little bit lower, it was enough to do sequencing.Considering the lower fidelity of the enzyme used for T7 amplification before, we changed into a better one called KD Plus and restarted to PCR, linking and transformation.The third sequencing still showed nothing right.The good one was we successfully got recombinant plasmid RdRp-L4440 while the bad one was nothing grew on the plate with CmRR.Further more, we want to use CRISPR-Cas9 system to make RdRp gene inserted into the genome of E.coli.Another part, we began to prepare the larvae of Chinese honeybee which was offered by our institute of bees.We put dsRNAs into fodder of the larvae of the honeybee to feed them.But we did again and the result was satisfied at that time.Tomorrow we will ask our advisor for some solutions and do it one more time.After figuring out the problem, we eventually got the all right dsRNAs.So we decided to use dsRdRp to inference CSBV.We used cDNA of RdRp and specific primers(Not1-F/Pst1-R?EcoR1-F/Pst1-R) to synthesize RdRp gene.Today was the first day that we began our project in the lab after we made a scientific plan.It was encouraging!Today we made RT-PCR with four sets of reverse specific primers and the RNA of CSBV to synthesize homologous cDNA(CSBV Helicase?Protease?VP1 and RdRp respectively).As we all know, RNA is easy to be digested in the environment.We added engineering bacteria with expressed dsRdRp, which was divided into three groups with different concentrations(low?mediate and high), into the fodder of the infected swarms.It showed that the number of infected larvae which were fed with HT115-dsRdRp in mediate and high concentration was remarkably less than the control group.Other two figures were made out, which showed the effect of dsRdRp on the number of sealed brood and the population of a colony respectively.So we used specific primers(EcoR1-F/Pst1-R) to synthesize T7 RNAP gene by PCR.As usual, pinking the positive colonies, PCR and sequencing.Next, we would continue to collect more data until we draw the scientific conclusion.With the development of our project, we gradually have realized that even if using yeast can solve the problem of biosecurity, there are still other troubles, such as less expression of dsRdRp in yeast, easier to loss plasmids in yeast and harder to digest the cytoderm of yeast for Chinese honeybees.So we need a better plan to deal with these to make a more practical production.After AGE, it showed that the CSBV-carried rate of first and second filial generation was 30% and 20% respectively, which was obviously declined.We detected the expression quantity of CSBV in offspring by RT-qPCR.That was what we would consider deeply in future work.Today we decided to constract RdRp-pSB1C3 again, because we thought T7 RNAP-pSB1C3 may be not a new part any more.According to the result of AGE, dsRdRp had been expressed in HT115 successfully, even though its concentration was a little bit lower.Next few days we would detect the expression quantity of CSBV in offspring.We made the figure of the effect of dsRdRp on the number of sac-like larvae.Then after 12h, we fed them another fodder with CSBV extracting solution.Then we began to link RdRp with L4440 and pSB1C3 using T4 ligase, 4?, overnight.We did transformation.And T7 RNAP gene was amplified by PCR(EcoR1-F/Xho1-R).Today we used IPTG, which was divided into two groups with different concentrations(0.4mmol/ml?0.8mmol/ml), to induce the expression of dsRdRp in HT115 for 5h.So the transformation of RdRp-pSB1C3 could only be done tomorrow.Today there was two news.)We got the preliminary result of index of swarms.So far, we got the target fragments successfully.Firstly, we extracted the whole RNA of CSBV by Trizol.We had to change T4 into a faster ligase..As predicted, there was still nothing on the plate.We did transformation again.The second sequencing was completely failed because the sequencing company could not get any plasmid.Then we collected the bacteria to extract dsRdRp by CTAB.Eventually,we got the matching sample after using KD Plus.So we want to recombine another vector,T7 RNAP-pYES2.We transformed RdRp-L4440 into HT115,culturing in 37?.We found with the decreasing of CSBV.We stored them in -20?.Today we went to observe the condition of swarms, and it was

different concentrations can induce GFP expression efficiently and have little influence on the level of GFP We transformed GFP-pYES2 into the yeast and let the recombinant strain grow to mid-log phase in YEPD medium containing 2% glucose.As the diagram shown, we can find that GFP production sharply increases in 10h and a peak shows up in about 24h and then it decreases gradually.We added

concentration increases by about 23.68% and 30.10% after 21days.Compared with the control group, it is quite obvious that the infected larvae in medium concentration group and in high concentration group dropped dramatically by 91.44 percent and 94 87.91 percent after 14 days while the infected larvae in control group showed 65.82 percent increase after 7 days.According to the statistics we collected, infected larvae fed with dsRdRp have the highest pupation rate among all the experimental groups.In conclusion, we can find using 0.02% galactose to induce the expression of GFP in 24h is a reasonable and efficient way to get the most production of GFP protein.For the high concentration group alone, the growth of population had reached almost 60% in just 21 days.We fed the infected hives

co-transformed the Bxb1 integrase behind the arabinose inducible promoter on a kanamycinbackbone with BBa_K1718005 (switch-LuxI-GFP) on 4C5.It was tested by growing cells in overnight cultures with varying concentrations of arabinose, from 0% to .2%increasing by .04% for a total of 6 cultures.To characterize and test the leakiness of the LuxPr promoter, we created a construct that placed the LuxPr promoter in front of RFP on a 1C3 backbone.To further characterize this observation, we grew up overnights with varying concentrations of arabinose and measured their fluorescence.Initially, we documented with pictures to illustrate the change in fluorescence and we observed a relatively smooth increase in brightness as the arabinose concentration increased.As illustrated in the flow cytometry characterization, we do see some cells fluorescing even when no arabinose is present, therefore the pBad promoter is leaky.Although the promoter is leaky, it is sufficient for our proof of concept at this stage of our project.Wehypothesized the lower copy number plasmid would provide more distinction between the concentrationsof AHL, especially after our first result in which all concentrations including the negative control turned adeep red.If the leakiness needed to be addressed, the promoter could be transferred to a lower copy plasmid or one could use a weaker pBAD promoter such as BBa_K206001, thereby reducing the effects of leakiness.When induced with (N-B-ketocaproyl)-L-homoserine lactone, a specific AHL molecule, the LuxPr promoter will allow transcription of RFP.However, the upper concentrations we aimed to test failed to grow, so the experiment should beWe had planned to test the promoter on a 4C5 backbone instead of the 1C3 used in this experiment.More tests should be done to confirm this trend and find the ideal concentration.Because we are using pBad as our promoter to start the cascade of responses in our system, we needed to test the leakiness of the promoter.4H (green) is the 10nm sample.All three of the samples with AHL added produced relatively more fluorescence than the negative control.A concentration of 10nm produced the most RFP, so would be the ideal concentration to use according tothis data.The 4th culture had low growth.Flow cytometry was performed on the cells after being resuspended in PBS which returned the resulting data.With the exception of the fourth sample, which was the culture with low growth, we see a general rightward trend in the peaks, indicating that higher concentrations of arabinose are more effective at inducing the production of the integrase.To do this, we put pBad on a 1C3 plasmid with Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP).The promoter, pBad, turns on in the presence of arabinose and in doing so, allows RFP to be transcribed.To characterize the promoter activity, we measured the RFP fluorescence with a flow cytometer.The experience page with the promoter also described achieving good results using EZ media, anPreliminary results with RFP and GFP showed that the switch was leaky when on a pSB1C3 backbone.We tested cells grown in 5 mL LB or 5mL M9 media with 25uL chloramphenicol at

(switch-LuxI-GFP) on 4C5.It was tested by growing cells in overnight cultures with varying concentrations of arabinose, from 0% to .2%increasing by .04% for a total of 6 cultures.To characterize and test the leakiness of the LuxPr promoter, we created a construct that placed the LuxPr promoter in front of RFP on a 1C3 backbone.To further characterize this observation, we grew up overnights with varying concentrations of arabinose and measured their fluorescence.Initially, we documented with pictures to illustrate the change in fluorescence and we observed a relatively smooth increase in brightness as the arabinose concentration increased.As illustrated in the flow cytometry characterization, we do see some cells fluorescing even when no arabinose is present, therefore the pBad promoter is leaky.Although the promoter is leaky, it is sufficient for our proof of concept at this stage of our project.Wehypothesized the lower copy number plasmid would provide more distinction between the concentrationsof AHL, especially after our first result in which all concentrations including the negative control turned adeep red.If the leakiness needed to be addressed, the promoter could be transferred to a lower copy plasmid or one could use a weaker pBAD promoter such as BBa_K206001, thereby reducing the effects of leakiness.When induced with (N-B-ketocaproyl)-L-homoserine lactone, a specific AHL molecule, the LuxPr promoter will allow transcription of RFP.However, the upper concentrations we aimed to test failed to grow, so the experiment should beWe had planned to test the promoter on a 4C5 backbone instead of the 1C3 used in this experiment.More tests should be done to confirm this trend and find the ideal concentration.Because we are using pBad as our promoter to start the cascade of responses in our system, we needed to test the leakiness of the promoter.4H (green) is the 10nm sample.All three of the samples with AHL added produced relatively more fluorescence than the negative control.A concentration of 10nm produced the most RFP, so would be the ideal concentration to use according tothis data.The 4th culture had low growth.Flow cytometry was performed on the cells after being resuspended in PBS which returned the resulting data.With the exception of the fourth sample, which was the culture with low growth, we see a general rightward trend in the peaks, indicating that higher concentrations of arabinose are more effective at inducing the production of the integrase.To do this, we put pBad on a 1C3 plasmid with Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP).The promoter, pBad, turns on in the presence of arabinose and in doing so, allows RFP to be transcribed.To characterize the promoter activity, we measured the RFP fluorescence with a flow cytometer.The experience page with the promoter also described achieving good results using EZ media, anPreliminary results with RFP and GFP showed that the switch was leaky when on a pSB1C3 backbone.We tested cells grown in 5 mL LB or 5mL M9 media with 25uL chloramphenicol at different concentrations of AHL starting at 0.1nM, increasing by a factor of 10 (0.1nM, 1.0nM, 10nM, 100nM, 1uM, 10uM).The cultures were made of 5mL of LB, 5ul of both chloramphenicol and kanamycin, and cells taken from a glycerol stock of cells with the desired plasmids.", "safety": "Instead, we used arabinose

also contains a 10mM phosphate standard solution, which can be diluted to create a series of standards (protocol can be found on our wiki under phosphate assay protocols.Our first phosphate assay

1, exopolyphosphatase, Phosphate-specific transporter and PhoE porin (we were unable to clone the latter two genes).We also had little succes cloning Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 s outer membrane porins involved in phosphate and polyphosphate uptake (OprP and OprO).The aim of the phosphate assay was to create a reliable method of determining the concentration of phosphate both inside of the cell and within the cell growth media.This assay showed concentrations similar to those calculated in the previous assay; however an observation was that as the volume of acid added increases, apart from peak at lower formic acid amounts, the concentration of phosphate recorded decreases.Figure 10 shows the amount of phosphate up taken from the media standardised using cell count (1.0 OD600 - 8x108 cells).Our hypothesis was that if the assay did not detect polyphosphate, we would have seen a significant decrease in the levels of phosphate detected when the glassmilk was used.From the results shown above in figure 8, we compared the amount of phosphate in the media of each sample.Graph showing the phosphate concentration within the cell lysate of 10^8, cells for 5 different ppk

Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis BA-91 strain ppk variant, ? ppk is Escherichia coli with ppk knockout using kanamycin KEIO collection.We then decided to join forces with the growth assay team to analyse the phosphate concentration in the growth media of ?pstA, ?pstC, ?pstB, ?pstS, ?phoE, ?ppk, ?ppx and BW25113 using our phosphate assay kit.From these results, we proceeded to run a second assay using two strains of ?ppx (47A7,48A7) and two strains of ?ppk (5D10, 6D10), along with the parent strain BW25113.Results from the previous experiment found that the phosphate concentrations recorded were far lower when the acid hydrolysis step was incorporated (results not shown).This step was added because we suspected that the ABCAM kit detected phosphate ions but not polyphosphate as the assay was only developed for the detection of orthophosphate, as correspondence with ABCAM, stated that the assay had not been used before to detect polyphosphate.Figure 6: Results from phosphate assay using various volumes of 1M formic acid, neutralised with 6M NaOH before plating.For this we took the media concentration and grew our cells for six hours, after this we took samples of the media and the cell lysate and analysed their phosphate content.To carry this out we used 200uL per well of each sample and used the dye from the ABCAM kit to analyse the phosphate concentration in each sample.After receiving our constructs, we needed to test the amount of phosphate that they could uptake.We also present phosphate amounts within cell lysate using the protocol stated on our wiki in our protocol section (Figure 12 , Figure 14) Within our results, we tested all ppk variant constructs.Therefore we present the amount of phosphate present in the media (Figure 13).This therefore indicates that the chromogenic complex formed between the phosphate reagent dye and the orthophosphate is affected by the formic acid by a decrease in pH.This is contrary to our hypothesis that the concentration of phosphate would increase as the polyphosphate in the cells was hydrolysed.Following from this, we prepared an additional phosphate assay using BW25113, ?ppk and ?ppx using the formic acid hydrolysis at 0uL, 1uL and 5uL of formic acid and neutralising using 6M NaOH.In this assay, we used glassmilk to remove the polyphosphate from the cell lysate.However, if the assay did detect polyphosphate, the phosphate levels would have been roughly the same.We found there was no difference between the phosphate concentrations in the growth media of all cell types under test.This result may have been due to the acid addition and thus resulting in a decrease in pH, affecting the complex formed between the phosphate ions and dye.However we were unable to conduct the same experiment on other constructs due to the MOPS media not being detected by the phosphate assay.This was with the aim of monitoring the change in phosphate concentration in the media following cell growth.For this assay, we used the strains BW25113, ?ppk and ?ppx of the KEIO collection.Our next assay focussed on altering the polyphosphate assay by finding a way to hydrolyse the polyphosphate chains within our modified cells, without affecting the complex formed between the malachite green, ammonium molybdate and inorganic phosphate.This result therefore did not confirm our theory that the kit does not detect polyphosphate and therefore, in order to effectively test the ability of the kit to detect polyphosphate; we planned to use glassmilk solution as a filter in our samples to separate the polyphosphate from the rest of the lysate.Following sonication of the cell samples, we added 50uL of 1 moldm-3 formic acid to hydrolyse the chains of polyphosphate to orthophosphate.These two proteins provide the translocation pathway and the phosphate\u0092s uptake is energized by a homodimer of PstB (an ATP-ase protein that hydrolyses ATP).Figure 5: Phosphate assay using glassmilk.Error bars calculated using standard error of mean cellular phosphate concentrations of technical repeats.Error bars calculated using standard error of the mean.Error bars are calculated using standard error of the mean.In order to do this we decided to test the amount of phosphate up taken by a known amount of cells (figure 10).Phosphate ions can then be used for cellular metabolism which includes ATP formation from ADP and phosphate by the F-ATPase protein.BW25113 is the Escherichia coli strain used for the experiment.From our results we found that the most reliable results were gained using 108 cells.However, from the results shown below in figure 2, the acid hydrolysed the DNA resulting in no overlapping peaks.LB was tested however an issue arose where the sample was not diluted sufficiently and a precipitant formed (Figure 7).Graph showing the phosphate concentration of cell lysate of 10^8, cells for 5 different ppk variants and 1 ppx variant after 6 hours.Figure 3: Polyphosphate assay following hydrolysis of polyphosphate chains using varying volumes of 1M formic acid.Figure 4: Polyphosphate assay using varying volumes of formic acid and neutralising using 1M NaOH.We also found that phosphate within the cells can be detected and varied between different strains (Figure 1).As well as using glassmilk to determine cellular polyphosphate concentration, we planned to use NMR to create a spectrum showing two separate peaks for orthophosphate and polyphosphate, of which could have been used to calculate concentration.This was because the phosphate backbone in DNA produces a peak in 31P NMR which overlaps with the orthophosphate peak, making the spectrum difficult to analyse.Error bars show the standard error of the mean from concentrations calculated from technical repeats.Graph showing the phosphate concentration within the media for 5 different ppk variants and 1 ppx variant after 6 hours .As a starting point, we used an ABCAM colorimetric assay kit (ab65622) containing a phosphate reagent dye composed of malachite green and ammonium molybdate.A chromogenic complex is formed between the dye and the phosphate ion (PO43-), producing an intense absorption at around 650nm.This assay involved experimenting with the quantity of cells under test and the volume of sample used in each well.This might be due to the fact that cells were allowed to reach stationary phase induced by phosphate limitation.Preparing glassmilk solution involved using a fume hood located in the chemistry teaching labs and heating concentrated nitric acid almost to boiling; a 50% water to glassmilk slurry was made and stored at room temperature.Figure 4 shows a weak trend between increased formic acid volume and decreased phosphate concentration.For the latter, the substrate binding protein (PstS) of the Phosphate-specific ABC transporter (Pst) binds the phosphate ion.Image acquisition was performed using Carl Zeiss imaging software ZEN (black edition 2012).The pH of the washing buffer should be 7.0 as the DAPI stain does not react with the polyphosphate granules even at the slight variation of pH.Although this may show polyphosphate, this unidentified source could be due to nucleic acids being hydrolysed by the acid.Interaction of polyP with DAPI shifts the emission maxima of the dye from 456 nm emitting blue fluorescence to 526 nm emitting bright yellow- green fluorescence2,3,4.Micrographs of immunostained cell coagulates and tissue sections were captured withNikon Eclipse T300 inverted wide field microscope equipped with a plan apochromat 63x oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).Figure 10 and figure 11 show all three ppks from Candidatus Accumulibacter have shown to be significantly more efficient at collecting phosphate than wild type BW25113.Figure 7: Image of plate showing precipitant due to high phosphate concentrations indicated by arrows.Therefore volumes of 10uL, 15uL, 20uL and 100uL of sample were added to each well to determine best dilution for the ABCAM assay.We found that this addition revealed a source of phosphate which is different from 0 uL of formic acid added.A potential solution to a pH effect was to add 1M NaOH to neutralise the acid hydrolysed solution before adding the phosphate reagent dye.We then tested samples that had been subjected to the glassmilk as well as samples that had not.One way ANOVA was used and the result showed overall there was statistically significant different.Following from this, we ran an assay on three colonies of BW25113 using our pre-prepared glassmilk solution.Biological repeats of a BW25113 colony was used, each set of three repeats contained a different volume of 1M formic acid, ranging between 0uL and 100uL.", "design": "", "human_practice": "Here a few comments we received:This was an excellent opportunity for the team to gain insight into the publics perspective, particularly that of the older generation.Participants were then required to add strawberries and the extraction solution from the beaker into a zip lock bag.The third and final day of the event gave the students chance to see which team got the most growth depending on the conditions their bioreactor was place in.A discussion was set up with Prof. David Efird a senior lecturer of Philosophy at the University

given permission to use the venue to carry out a simple demonstration in which members of the public could isolate DNA from strawberries.We have been featured in the University of Yorks central online news,in student newspaper Nouse and online blog Mind the Horizon.The team took the advantage to talk to perspective biology students at the University of York s open days in June.A small group of our team visited a local primary school with the aim of leading a lesson based on the concept of \u0091good\u0092 and \u0091bad\u0092 bacteria.A round table discussion was set up for all recipients of the funding across the university to come speak to members of Santander s team.Our team has had various articles published to raise the profile of the contest and our project.Here we spoke of our project and the general focus of the iGEM competition.To further advertise the contest and our project we produced leaflets to be distributed at an event know as the Festival of Ideas.It became clear in the visit that many of the individuals had little scientific knowledge on the matter but associated the topic with many negative stories from the media.A talk titled \u0091The ethics of genetic modification\u0092 was organised to discuss the science and ethics behind GM along with introducing our project.10ml of 100% ethanol was measured and then added to the beaker.From this we saw that the number of members agreeing with GM increased but so did the number that disagreed.Many of our visitors discussed the topic of GM with us and kindly left comments at the end of the demonstration.The talk was then carried out to give the participants a better understanding on the topic.During this practical session the students were taught the importance of aseptic techniques in the laboratory setting.For the second day in the labs students were tasked with creating their own \u0091bioreactors\u0092 to grow their previously transformed cells.With this in mind we designed a segment to be apart of the newsletter that is sent to the Alumni.Our team was fortunate enough to receive funding from Santander Universities to help with the travel costs of getting to the Jamboree in Boston.We

during the team s dry lab period.View OriginalThe FBA computer model looks for the most efficient, if not the most realistic, pathways to use, meaning it was difficult to force any amount of flux through the pathways we had created to accumulate phosphate.As phosphate is used in nearly every part of the cells metabolome, we felt it was important to determine how the accumulation of large amounts might affect the overall function of our organism.These include, Polyphosphate Kinase (PPK), Exopolyphosphatase (PPX), and the Phosphate Specific Transporters (Pst).FBA calculates estimates of the rates at which metabolites in an organism will pass through various reaction pathways.The outcomes of the model also point to potential further developments that are currently out of reach due to the iGEM timeframe, but would greatly develop our final product.One of the immediate problems we found is that phosphate is used by many different parts of the cell, and as such altering any one part has knock on effects on many others.Graph showing correlation between theoretical growth restriction and accumulation of polyphosphate.The results of our model allowed us to better direct the project towards the genes that would give us our desired result, and provide a good starting point for optimising the levels of gene expression.These rates increase in a linear way as further restrictions on growth are put in place, showing direct links between growth and our organisms ability to accumulate phosphate.Figure 2.Each of the red nodes represents a metabolic reaction in which phosphate is a major component.Metabolic pathway map for E.

Zhang designed a system of 4 plasmids working in the E. coli BAP 1 strain and leading to erythromycin A production with a yield of 10 mg per liter of culture media.7  PlastiCure is a well-designed biological system composed of 2 parts: degradation and synthesis.The plastic then works its way up our food chain and ends up on our plates.5PlastiCure is a biological system designed to degrade PET and use the degradation products to synthesize bio-active compounds.This will allow E. coli to express all of the necessary biodegradation and biosynthesis genes.Fig.3 - Our E. coli system is able to synthesize biologically active products and at the same time degrade plastic waste.The most common plastics are polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP).Fig.1 - Evolution of the world plastic production, in million of tons, from 1950 to 2020.1 However, the treatment of plastic is not yet suited to the exponential growth of plastic production.Therefore, PlastiCure has been thought to be derived so we can use the plastic degradation module of our system to produce a broad diversity of products.This leads to an increase in plastic in nature which pollutes our ecosystem, especially the oceans.Fig.2 - Treatment of post-consumer plastics waste in 2012, in the European Union.3The problem is worsened by the size of the plastic particles: they are mostly microparticles.In 2000, the world plastic production was about 190 million tons per year whereas today, it is roughly 300 million tons per year (Fig.1).Complete Biosynthesis of Erythromycin A and Designed Analogs Using E. coli as a Heterologous Host.This would enable us to degrade a different plastic and still synthesize Erythromycin A or to degrade PET but synthesize a different molecule.coli will be used as a heterologous host to integrate exogenous DNA sequences in multiple operons (82 % of our designed operons will be composed of heterologous genes).An analysis of European plastics production, demand and waste data7 - Haoran Zhang, Yong Wang, Jiequn Wu, Karin Skalina, and Blaine A.

cluster-specific lox sequence extended with the overlapping sequences.To automate the mixing of the genes we used site-specific recombination by means of the Cre/lox system, and we went a step further by identifying 5 self-recombining lox sequences (Figure 1).The strain harboring the best operon organisation will have the fastest growth and will therefore be sequenced.1 - Georgi KANTCHEV and Serena

switch from the Gibson assembly method to the Yeast assembly method, which is more accurate during replication.Homologous recombination is performed between the overlapping regions resulting after the resolution of the Holliday junction in an uncut plasmid harbouring our degradation operon.Recent drop in oil prices made it more advantageous to use virgin plastic instead of recycled plastic thus jeopardizing countries  efforts to protect the environment.1To do so we want to combine into one system an optimised polyethylene glycol (PET) degradation pathway with a biosynthetic pathway: we aim to transform plastic waste into erythromycin A.To express the degradation pathway in Escherichia coli we decided to assemble the different genes into one operon.Those molecules are the results of the cleavage of PET.Our system is composed of 15 genes, 13 of which are recombined, yielding 6 billion combinations.We assumed that the genes coding for enzymes that are close in the metabolic pathway shouldn t be too much separated.Pollution of our ecosystem by plastic waste is undoubtedly one of the major issues of the century.We added at the beginning and at the end of the cluster a non-coding nucleotide sequence for the purpose of PCR amplification of the correctly-assembled construct.The promoter as well as the terminator was put outside this combinatorial system to avoid the change of their position.The increasing production and use of plastic materials combined with the lack of interesting financial returns have just worsened the situation.By assigning 1 specific lox sequence to one cluster and placing the last self-recombining one between each cluster we are able to change the position of each gene inside it s cluster and shuffle the cluster within the operon.",

have to be very careful that the modified strain of E.coli does not leave the plant and ends up in the ecosystem.In normal conditions people would not be directly exposed to the bacteria.We also thought of the possibility of using our bacteria before the plastic ends up in the ecosystem, at recycling facilities.The plant would function as follows : the water containing micro- and macro-particles of plastic enters the plant and is put in a first container where the bacteria are located.In order to reduce the risk of leaks into the ecosystem, we would implement a filtration system.This would be the main issue with our project.At the French Meet-up in Bordeaux, the Paris_Saclay team advised us to use a compartment with two filters to be safer and to reduce the risk of contamination.We also plan to have a kill switch using an inducible promoter, so that the promoter will not function outside of our factory.We also thought about what we could do to reduce contamination risks if our projet would become real.One application of our project is to use our bacteria in small to medium enclosed industrial plants.The plastic is digested and the fluid moves on to the second compartment after filtration.We also used Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, another Biosafety Level 1 organism during our experiments.As mentioned in the final safety form submitted in August 28, 2015, we worked in a Biosafety Level 1 lab and we took all the required precautions.PlastiCure has been thought in a modular fashion in order to produce a broad diversity of products, as an

would be designed and the chassis chosen with biosafety in mind.We wanted to design a chassis that could be used as broadly as possible in iGEM, so we asked in our survey to iGEM teams which organism they chose as chassis.Thus, any alleged dissemination would be impossible.These mechanisms can be of several types, the most famous examples are the suicide genes (encoding RNAse, DNase) and/or the establishment of a nutrient dependency, where the selected nutrient does not exist in the external environment.We reviewed previous iGEM projects over the last decade and found that despite the crucial aspect of biosafety in synthetic biology and iGEM, especially for projects registered in \"Environment\" and \"Health / Medicine\" track, often no biosafety mechanism is designed, or even considered.Indeed, biological machines designed in the iGEM competition, and more generally in synthetic biology, do not exist in nature and can be randomly introduced into existing natural biomass through undesired cross interactions.This is why the scientific community is unanimous in saying that the \"biosafety mechanisms\" are essential and will ensure the neutralization of the living device created outside the laboratory conditions under which it was generated.Most laws, \"guidelines\" and associations related to the Biosafety agree in trying to prevent the spread of any living modified organism.First, we wanted to provide the iGEM community with a system able to prevent, or at least significantly reduce, the main risk: the spread of GEO.This system would include biological containment with parts that can be integrated in the genome of any Escherichia coli chassis and called SafetE.coli.This is clearly stipulated in the Cartagena protocol on Biosafety (international Convention on Biological Diversity): \"The Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential Risks Posed by living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting and from modern biotechnology\".Very often, the risks related to the safety of a genetically modified organism (GEO), except for a possible toxicity or pathogenicity of the organism, correspond to the spread of GEO.This reason is understandable given the complexity of the challenge of Biosafety.In this context, the 2015 iGEM Paris Saclay team decided to focus its project entirely on Biosafety.This may be due

"background": "", "description": "If no shift occurs in the SLT migration pattern, this implies the absence of the toxin within the sample, and reflects the safety of the food.In summary, we will be creating a portable device that would evaluate the safety of food by detecting a specific contaminant, Shiga-like toxin, for street vendors and restaurant owners and even government agencies to use and reassure consumers who rely heavily on their foods.Currently, Shiga toxin detection must be conducted in a laboratory environment utilizing time-consuming PCR and assay techniques, so consumers have no way of protecting themselves without strong legislation.Lack of action taken by governments and street food vendors in developing countries lead to the prevalence of street food-related illnesses, and call for the necessity of consumer awareness.Figures displaying this outcome and relevant protocols are shown both in our experiments and results pages.Improving on the IIT Madras project on spreading awareness related to the toxic effects of Shiga Toxin in developing countries, the NYU-AD iGEM team decided to build a portable device that would detect the presence of Shiga Toxin in street food, especially in meat products.Keeping the validation process in mind, we decided to use only the SLT B subunit as our method of verification[5].Gold Medal requirement: Improving a previous iGEM projectIn addition to our main project, we have improved the characterization and validated the functionality of a previously submitted part by NYUAD iGEM team 2015.We have performed an Indole detection test to validate proper expression of indole of e.coli cells.A shift in migration pattern on a PAGE gel will occur when Gb3 is bound indicating the presence of the toxin in the food sample.Through our device, we exploit the binding of Gb3 to subunit B and compare the migration pattern of the bound Gb3-subunit B complex to a non bound subunit B.Our device is designed to detect for the Shiga toxin in at most 45 minutes.This is quicker than the fastest laboratory detection method[4].Initially, our target audience was the consumer, but as we developed our project, there were several factors such as affordability and accessibility that made it difficult for consumers to use the device.Furthermore, we also made a brochure outlining information related to the potency of the Shiga Toxin.One of the primary microbial contaminants is the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (or E. coli) O157:H7 (STEC).After extensive research and intense discussion, we decided to move forward with the idea of detecting pathogenic SLT-producing E. coli in street foods.\"Rapid detection of Shiga toxin-producing bacteria in feces by multiplex PCR with molecular beacons on the smart cycler.\"\"Economic cost of illness due to Escherichia coli O157 infections in the United States.\"Whereas the IIT Madras team focused on expressing an anti-toxin against the deadly Shiga Toxin and tried to target the mechanism by which the Shiga Toxin is formed in E.coli, the NYU-AD iGEM team took a giant leap ahead by incorporating the practices of synthetic biology into the real world.The latter binds to a globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor, expressed on the surface of the target cells[3].Ultimately, our project is to create a device that would detect the Shiga-like toxin in foods more conveniently and more quickly than current available methods.Shiga-like toxins are exotoxins, which consist of a toxic enzymatic A subunit and a cell-binding B subunit.We hope that by providing a device that is more convenient and produces results faster than current detection methods, entities responsible for food safety regulation such as governmental agencies and even food vendors themselves will be motivated to take stronger action towards maintaining food safety.Before making our final decision, we explored an extremely diverse range of project topics such as blockage of oil pipes, controlling fruit ripening, detecting milk adulteration, biodegradable plastics, bioelectronics, preventing the coral reefs bleaching, bio-art, smoking, monitoring air quality, and more.Furthermore, we also reduced the time for each individual step in the process to ensure that the detection could take place as quickly as possible.Research shows that E. coli causes 73,000 illnesses in the United States every year.This interaction is responsible for the toxin s entry into the host cell.SLT is highly toxic due to its low LD50 and the A subunit\u0092s protein synthesis inhibitory action, so it would have been too dangerous to work with given our lab environments.B\u00e9langer, Simon D., et al.Frenzen, Paul D., et al.", "design": "After running the gel and staining (with zinc stain), the bands can be visualized readily since the device comes with a black cover, which helps in visualizing the clear bands against the opaque milky-white background.Although we have 3D printed a prototype of our device, we were not able to print the fully functioning device due to time constraints.After running experiments in the lab, we can further optimize the process by setting a default running time for the gel, a default staining time and an optimal voltage, depending on the size of the gel, and hence make the device as user-friendly as possible.We changed our prototype to a fully mechanized integrated device that would perform all the operations in one compartment.After the gel has run, the buffer can be drained into the waste container by pressing a button on the side of the device.After careful consideration, we settled with the idea of a vertical device, which also made the draining process a lot easier.After talking to engineering design professors from NYUAD, we realized that the device could actually be much more useful for street food vendors.The final functioning version of the device is expected to work the following way: a button would control the flow into the wells, allowing 50 microliters of fluid to flow into the wells each time it is pressed.The next step is to pour the buffer into the device by pressing a button that allows the buffer to just cover the surface of the gel without overflowing (the dimensions of the containers were chosen to ensure the appropriate volumes).Although we are still only designing a prototype, the vision is that the fully functional product would be used by consumers/ food vendors without any lab background.Our prototype went through several iterations.Our team has been working to create a portable device that gives rapid results without compromising the accuracy of the results.This initial design can be found here.However, despite optimizing each step of the process, the feedback from our human practices team indicated that most consumers were unhappy to wait for around 45 minutes for the results of the testing.The gel would run in the first compartment, followed by staining in the second and observation in the last compartment.Furthermore, we are aiming to eliminate any direct contact between the user and the food and solution samples to ensure the accuracy of results and avoid any additional contamination or safety risks.Pictures of the 3-D animation of this prototype can be found below:The dimensions of the gel are 16 cm x 10 cm.", "human_practice": "",

"result": "Figures displaying our design and showing the prototyped device in 3D can be found in the Design Page.All of our results are reproducible using the protocols we followed, which are available in our Experiments Page.As any project, ours also suffered from several failures:We failed to perform experiments detecting successful synthesis of Gb3 in cells that expressed Gb3 synthase.We also failed to run experiments to isolate and purify the His-tagged Subunit B of the Shiga-like toxin encoded by one of our submitted parts due to delays in procurement and delivery of required equipment and reagents.We failed to transform and validate expression of Gb3 synthase from our part encoding the Gb3S under control of a strong constitutive promoter.We suspect that the promoter strength had led to an excessive expression of Gb3S that turned out to be detrimental to our cells.We failed to drive our device to its complete functionality and as it stands now, it remains at a prototype stage.We aim to address all of the failures above in later years, and improve our experimental protocols to validate all of our submitted parts and drive this project to completion.Figure 3 represents the change in color as an indication of indole production from transformed cells.Finally, we have successfully designed and 3D printed a prototype of our device that will eventually, once fully functional, will allow for the detection Shiga toxin contaminations of food samples in a period of time not exceeding 45 mins with no lab setup required and in a user friendly, mostly hands-off manner.", "safety": "Since the Safety Level of the lab in our university that we worked in is Level 1, we carefully chose to work with E. coli DH5 alpha, a non-pathogenic chassis organism.We were accompanied by one of our Secondary PI\u0092s, Joseph Koussa, who is also the safety officer of the lab we worked in, at all times.During the first few weeks into working on our project, every team member was required to participate in several lab safety training sessions.Individually, student members watched a Lab Orientation Video that goes over the basic information of safety procedures.These sessions covered specific topics including the following:Outside of the lab environment, members went through EHS Lab Safety Training Lessons.Everyone was aware of the safety procedures, and nobody took any risky actions during the lab work.The following is an outline of the included material:Note the Nearest Fire Exits and your escape routes.You must wear safety goggles at all times while doing experiments.Bare feet or any type of open shoes or sandals cannot be worn into a chemical laboratory.In case of any accident or spill, notify the lab instructor immediately.Eye injuries, whether chemical or mechanical, must always be considered serious.Throw away cracked or chipped glassware immediately and obtain replacements.Do not touch any chemical with
