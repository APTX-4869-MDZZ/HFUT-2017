project.provided ZJU-China and some other iGEM teams with the chance to show our project to the public, the show can be regarded as one part of our human practice.Dr. Yu helped us with the CNC part including characterization of CNC, operation of equipment and assistant analysis.who is in charge of the lab in which we worked helped us a lot with daily experiment work, keeping the whole lab in order.from Shandong University provided us with the vital and precious strain TT01, which contains genes called tcdA1 and tcdB1.of Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum gave us the opportunity to publicize our project as well as synthetic biology.The main part of the project was finished by the 15 students from ZJU-China iGEM team.an overgraduate student in College of Agriculture and Biotechnology helped us finish the termite simulation experiments including (Cellulase and lysozyme activity measurement, toxic bacteria feeding experiment, trophallaxis verification, avermectin detection in trophallaxis ect.)A professor at CAU pointed out some mistakes in our project and offered us numerous constructive advices to improve our method of avermectin manufacture.We also performed some social research for human practice, we went to communities and areas where the termite problem is serious.Owing to the effort we\u0092ve made for outreach, we got the chance to collaborate with ZJSTM and made great preparation for human practice.", "background": "", "description": "According to incomplete statistics, all over the world, the annual expenditure of termites control exceeds a billion dollars.IGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015 has created TERMITE TERMINATOR, a genetically modified toxins expression system with a delivery carrier cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , capable of trapping termites based on their trophallaxis, and then kill the whole nest.We choose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites.Following the instruction, they open the outer shell, put the box of food inside, spread some water on the surface of the food, and place the device in a corner where is dark, damp and termites can be seen.But if the damage is due to termites, repairing will be only a temporary protection.The ZJUTT (ZJU TERMITE TERMINATOR) sees this problem and therefore cooperates with the ancient building protection department.As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people  houses, we can bring the result of the project into production.As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people  houses, we can bring the result of the project into production.With the monitor, precaution can be taken and use ZJUTT devices kill termites before they cause any damage.Under the dazzling sunshine of summer, students are sweating, reading their textbooks.When 3 months pass and there are nearly no termites, take out the food box form the device and burn the rest food if possible.Termites are not only in school but also in people s houses.What s more annoying is that, the termites are also coming!It really influences public safety and people\u0091s life in a negative way.Because of the photophobic habit of termites, they always move in a covert condition.They are always one of the toughest problem for those forest keepers.In order to get rid of termites in the whole economic forest region, the forest protection agency contact ZJUTT.What s more, termites have tenacious vitality and will soon spread through the forest.Simply placing the drugs that will kill the termites is also a way we might use when locating the nest is quite impossible or the nest is quite dispersed.However, the drug used in this way is toxic to many species other than termites, and will produces much ecological pressure consequently.The special hazardous way of termites makes people ignore their invasion at the early time.Termites will die after feeding in the trap.This habit also makes termites one the city pests, which are the most difficult and expensive to control.First, termites have the strong adaptability and viability.Every summer, the termites are flying all around.Finally, the termites disappear from the region.The other is that, the holes left by termites crawling could affect the integrity and security of buildings, dams and trees.Termites are widely recognized as the fifth pest around the world, based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards woods and infrastructure.Sometimes we can do precautions by pesticide application or by reinforcing the buildings that might suffer from the termites.Walk in the supermarket and pick up the household type termites killing device produced by ZJUTT.If the termites are convicted by the technicians, termites control shoold be applied first to eliminate the future danger.What\u0091s more, the hazards caused by termites to communal facilities such as large reinforced concrete bridges, gas lines, are frequently reported these years.Taking the Coptotermes formosanus as an example, which is the most harmful termite around the world; however this species once only distributed in several regions, such as Chinese mainland and Taiwan province.With the transportation of massive supplies in World War II, these termites  distribution range has gradually enlarged.In the following ten years, if possible, it could acheive mass production of TERMITE TERMINATOR and could be widely used with our designed devices.Separately over expressed in E.coli and another host, toxins were then delivered to the termites by the cell carrier.We expect that the drug will attach to the termite and be carried back to the nest, then the whole nest of termite can be killed for one time.Account for the effect of warm wet air current from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, many provinces with warm climate, plentiful water and abundant vegetation own special preferences for termites.Thus, there is a group of people working in the forest protection agency to take care of these trees.In the breeding heyday, a mature termite queen s daily oviposition is over ten thousand.Termite is an ancient social insect in the world for about 0.13 billion years.According to the above result, Zhejiang is one of the most regions of termite occupation and plagued by them.In mainland China, Coptotermes formosanus is the kind of species doing harm to housing constructions even on 20 floors; woods; communication facilities ect.It can be absorbed through and damage the mucous membranes; also harmful to the kidneys and liver.Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.With the map and other information that the agency provided, ZJUTT will draw up a plan with the optimum locations for killing devices placement.Although application with a garden hose and sprayer is relatively easy, gardeners can t simply apply nematodes to the landscape whenever they feel like it and expect them to work.As for rural country housing and landacaping? Coptotermes formosanus is the main species.Devices will be taken back to the company for sterilization and reuse.This is really a staggering number and it is the fact.As for urban housing, Reticulitermes speratus is the main species followed by Coptotermes formosanus.We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs.We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs.2013 reported in the literature, 371 destructive termite species occupy 12.5% of current total species.One is that termites take materials rich in lignocellulose as food, which causes property damage to human beings.Given that a termite weighed 1 gram, then everyone around the world should own about 500 thousand termites!Calcolated amount of food have been beforehand put into the device.Apply nematodes at dawn or dusk, because high levels of ultraviolet rays from the sun can kill them.You need to use live nematodes as soon as possible for maximum efficacy, because they have a limited shelf life.But the cost could be huge and in many cases we don t have ways to determine the range of the precautions.If they become dry, they could die.Nematodes do their work under the soil surface, gardeners don t see dead insect bodies, making efficacy hard to measure.According to the experimental results of computer simulation, average per person holds 0.5 tons of termite resources.They are now filling nearly every corner of the globe, from tropical regions to subtropical ones, which occupies 50% of the earth s area.It requires a lot of human cost in the early days.They may live in the interlayer of ceiling, walls or wood floor, eating your clothes, books and furniture.Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device with the function of monitoring and terminating for better achieving.Tree keepers together with company technicians will bring the device to the place.We decided to have the carrier for: reducing the loss; improving transport efficiency; targeting the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment to some extent.When repairing is needed, ZJUTT technicians will show up first, rather than the maintenance worker.Adequate moisture is the most important -- nematodes need water to move and find host insects.Technical staff will go to the forest for field trips to evaluate the severity.The spawning of one year reaches up to five hundred millions.Third, termites could achieve different-distance spread and distribution by virtue of flight spread, pervasive invasion and factitious carry, owning to their strong transmission capacity.The propagation of termites sometimes results in wide spread of termites  harm.These devices are used to attract termites to check if there is any new hidden termites nest.It is reported that, the direct loss induced by termites is beyond 220 billion dollars per year.These are very small unsegmented worm species which search for hosts, like termites, and burrow into them, causing death within approximately 48 hours.He advise the school stuff to buy a few small size termites killing devices from ZJUTT.Open the package and put it at places where termites can be seen.But what make them stressfol is that the forest regions are always inhabited by termites.Factory is the base and during improvements as well as experiments, social users data is collected for further promotion and perfection.There are termites all over the five continents.The harm that termites bring to human mainly reflects in two aspects.In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents.In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents.It often takes a long time from termites invasion to being discovered.Trees that destroyed by termites will lost their economic value.At present this kind of termites has caused serious damages in numerous countries and regions, turning into cosmopolitan pest.", "design": "Here is our device and it works in three aspects.In fact, we made a big improvement about our device on the monitor unit recently.We also design a wider ring under the cover, to avoid the slide when device shaking When using the device, customers should place the Attracting Cover with wood to attract more termites.However, when we talked about our device with Prof. Mo, an expert on termite control, he told us that when termites eat wood, their secretion flows out and sticks on the wood nearby.Further more, we decided to design a digital circuit for customers so that they may discover the situation in a shorter time with less attention paid to the device.The device works like this: Pine put in the device will attract termites and when climbing into the device, they will eat the Toxin accidently and die in or out of the device.After the effective Toxin was coated by CNC, we need a convenient device to place our poison in.Once termites eat the block, the string will elongate and another wooden block will get out of the device to alert the users.In order to be easier for the users to clean it up for a second use the device is designed to be removable.With this application, it does not matter if our customers have any problem using our device.In our new version, we abort this design and change the passageway in the box into small holes.In the last version, we used a compressed spring which is connected to a thin wooden block.By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of TERMITE TERMINATOR and present Techno-moral vignettes, focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application.Once they notice the bottom holes are getting smaller, or stuck by termites\u0092 secretion, the Trap Cover should take the place of the attracting cover and the Kill Function works!One of our goals is to kill all termites in a house.We want to kill all termites but our toxin will not be influential for a very long period.Besides functions, we think more to improve our device.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "In the last two period, Toxin starts to degrade.Here (v_{Toxin}) is the velocity that Toxin is produced.In this page, we model the process of the production and degrade of Toxin to find the influence to ({Toxin-CNC-Time}), or the degradation time of Toxin in CNC-coat.({Toxin-CNC-Time}) is the degradation time of Toxin in CNC-coat while ({Toxin-air-Time}) is that in the air.Respectively, ({CNC-digest-Time}) is the time when the bait comes into another termite s gut(trophallaxis) and the CNC-coat is completely digest there.They are (t_{2}) and (t_1), respectively.$$frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} = frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]} - frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}$$$$frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} = - frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}$$Still, use function (arctan) take the place of comparing, we get the final function.Because (n_2) must be even and (frac{1}{{x^{-100}}+1}) is the integral, we choose the last one.With some typical parameter, we use NDSolve function to solve the ordinary differential equation, the answer is as below.And (K_m) is called Michaelis constant.(V_{max,2}) is the reducing velocity when Toxin is saturation, and (K_{m,2}) is another Michaelis constantThe two equation seems simple in separate formate, but it became complex when considering time factor.For the time (t_1) is much less than (t_2), the change at that time is not obvious.frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} &=&(1-step(t,t2)) frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]} - step(t,t1) frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}\\(step) function can be placed by (frac{1}{{x^{-100}}+1}) etc.To study the tendency of the reaction, the figure is at a long time (three of four times than (t_2)), and the dark green curve is a standard (exp) function curve.We will discuss is in the next section.We do not have enough time to measure the exact time when termite digest, but I suppose we have got it, as well as the time that Toxin starts to resolve.What we concern is that when our CNC-coat is degraded, the Toxin is still in the cell.During the first two period, cell produce Toxin.(V_{max}) is the producing velocity when substrate is saturated.([S]) is substrate s concentration.There are four important parameters in our design, which are ({CNC-digest-Time}), ({CNC-degradation-Time}), ({Toxin-CNC-Time}) and ({Toxin-air-Time}).Although we can premise that the Toxin will be separate by CNC-coat, and our device, as a second protection, can stop Toxin s spread, the only device s protection may not be really enough.While the next one, means even though the CNC-coat is degraded, Toxin will degrade right away so that it will not cause environment pollution.({CNC-degradation-Time}) is when CNC-coat degrades in national condition.In the ordinary differential function, we can solve the two condition respectively, but a continues function will enhance the flexibility and simplicity.Toxalbumin is produced by cell, and resolved by enzyme or itself.We built model for the process basic on Michaelis-Menten equation.", "notebook": "Discussed the application scenario for the 5000\u0080 additional sponsership of SYNENERGENE.Contacted with

eliminate all the termites in my apartment.Some of people who choose professional institute are those who know the severity of termite damage, for example, the security mentioned above.I threw the damaged furniture and fit my house again\u0085.\u0094  Although some people have experienced the damage brought by termites, the public didn\u0092t know much about the current issue about termites in Hangzhou.Fig4: Booklets presented by Hangzhou Institute of Termite Control Photo by: Zju-igemer  Fig5: ZJU-igemer consulting staff of Termite Control Institute Photo by: Zju-igemer  Although China has already earned a profound system for termite control, people who suffer from termite damage would not always choose professional institution to deal with termite invasion.Fig1: Page of termite control of a pest control company in the U.S http://www.doyourownpestcontrol.com/termite.htm  Although Chinese has a much higher population density than America, there are more wood structure buildings in America, the level of termite damage in both countries are randomly the same.But those who didn t know much about the termites would like to buy pesticide, they think they can win the termites.Citizens do not know much about Termites\u0092 living habits and their current condition, but they all have heard about the information of termites.They used the chemical insecticide and dug out the whole nest to control termite damage.People are willing to choose professional institute to control termites, but if their scale is not very large, people may choose kill termites by themselves.Chinese termite control institute has a low charging standard, because government pays them the fundamental funds and technical assistance for local institute.More than 70% of our interviewee have experienced termite damage, and they all know that termites can destroy woods with a super speed.Commercial corporations often provide citizens housing termite control services, and government agencies do better at the maintenance of public facilities.Some of interviewees would like to choose environment-friendly lifestyle, but most people will make their decision depend on the killing effect.In this summer, igemers from ZJU-CHINA visited Hangzhou Institute Of Termite Control to get more information about the current situation of termite control and consult with them about our project design.Words on banner: We Have To Win The War Against Termites  The Government Of China has set up institutes of termite control in various provinces since 1960s, in order to have better effects for fighting against termites.Termite control in the U.S consists of two main parts------commercial corporations and government agencies.However, as what is happening in China, some people would like to deal with termites by themselves, so some companies also provide customers advisors to treat termites in a suitable way.Fig5: the public promotion page of Chinese termite control institute http://www.zgbyfz.cn/byfz.asp?cid=%B0%D7%D2%CF%CE%A3%BA%A6  American institutes pay more attention to the customer experience.At the beginning, people who focused on fighting against termites were the commons who did not have enough knowledge to deal with termites.It is worth mentioning that the destruction left by termites seems to be much more serious on historic buildings.The terrible damage to water conservancy projects caused by termites is still a great threat to the water project planning in China.The door case became into powder, all the chairs could not be used, and the reproductive termites lay on the windows.When people have problems of termite damage, they usually look for a company to solve them.80% of the dam breaks in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Region are due to termites.Fig1: People held a meeting to discuss how to control termites in 1950s.All the wooden furniture had been damaged by termites.Would you choose the pesticide, which has a bad impact to the environment but works fast and has a lower price?Obviously, provinces seated in the region south of the Yangtze River suffer more from termite damage.Question 2: Almost 50% of interviewees would choose professional institute, and another 50% prefer to buy pesticide themselves.We pick 8 typical provinces, which locate from south to north: Hainan; Guangxi; Guangdong; Fujian; Anhui; Hubei; Shandong and Liaoning, and then gather the rough data for termite damage to the housing construction.Most citizens do not know the significance of \u0091environment-friendly\u0092 and do not care about the problem, and they prefer chemical termitcide.For this reason, ZJU-IGEMers tried to promote the idea of \u0091From Nature For Nature\u0092 to realize the environment-friendly synthetic biological method to termite control--------Termite Terminator.Would you like to choose biological control method, which is much safer but costs more?In the campus of Zhejiang University, in spring and summer it is easy to see the trees intruded by termites.The website pages of American termite control company show a customer-friendly attitude and leave an effective impact to people scan their websites.One female white collar pointed out that, it doesn\u0092t matter how much it costs, the most important thing is to live healthily.Chemical insecticide costs less and the low-dose poison won\u0092t be harmful to human being.People prefer to call for governmental institutes to eliminate termites  4.The integrated control of termites begins in 1950s in China.People that do not choose biological drugs have two main reasons, one is that cheap and valid chemical is enough for them to use.Fig4: trees damaged by termites in German Park photo by: Ming Chen ZJU-instructor  Every southern

"background": "", "description": "2) occurs inBased on the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP in the pathways mentioned above, GPP synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation between IPP and DMAPP to synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the burden for E. coli, so in our research, we transferred both GPPS gene and LS gene into theIn our project we decided to use E. coli, MEP pathway to express limonene.We then add 5?L 5% limonene (T) and DMSO (C) respectively at the two small circular filters in the experimental groups(Fig.This proves that many terpenes can attract plant-parasitic nematodes in naturalSome researches showed that limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\u0092s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many kinds of volatiles to induce nematodes that are harmful to these predators.We put two small pieces of circular filter paper 2.5cm from the center of the circle (Fig.Later we add 30?L suspension of the nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\u00a0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.", "design": "First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\u0092s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.The fourth area is made up of a cuboid outer shell, which can support the device.The figure above shows our product \u0096 Device 1.0.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.This change fulfills our aim to save money and energy, which is also more economical and enviromentally friendly.As shown above, device 2.0 has two shells \u0096 an outer shell and an inner shell.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.The third area is light controlling area, which includes a LED light.When it is turned on, red emission will activate the promoter and bacterial cells will express attracting substance; while the LED light is turned off, toxalbumin will be produced.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "To make the project applicable in real life, we designed a device with modified engineering bacteria inside, which can be placed in soil to attract and kill nematodes.Assuming there is a farmland, we took advantage of gas diffusion and nematodes\u0092 movement analogue simulation to find the best position for the device to be placed.We established a database to broaden the scope of our applications, combined with our methods, to kill more different pests.Additionally, it takes time for nematodes to reach the device, so we can determine the distance between the devices we place according to the three-day-period and the crawl speed of nematodes.Let L be the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment, V is nematodes\u0092 crawl speed, and T is time nematodes need to develop into adult.Firstly, we considered a square farmland, to minimize the number of equipment we use, the arrangement mode of equipment is as follows (firstly, we consider the situation with four devices arranged together).As shown above, the white circles represent the devices of colon bacillus, while the bigger circles represent diffusion, with the same odorousness in a circle.Our modeling process is given below:Nematodes can be attracted if the attraction concentration of limonene is higher than the lowest attractant concentration and then can move towards the direction of the highest odor concentration after attracted by the limonene smell[4].Engineering bacteria in our device are able to produce enough limonene as we need.Nematodes move on a 2D plane.The rules of the movement are as follows:The nematodes move towards 4 different directions: front, behind, right and left;Every time the nematode choose one of the 4 directions randomly and the probability of these 4 directions are the same;If the nematode move to the place where the gas concentration is lower than the previous position, then the nematode will move back to the previous position.We did the different simulation experiments with one device in the farmland and four devices in the farmland separately.In order to apply our hypothesis and methodology to more agricultural pests control, we established a database.And we can achieve remote control by using radio technology.With these improvements to our device, we want to figure out how we can put our technology into practice in farmland, and whether our device would be more efficient and economical than the methods used currently used in killing nematodes (crop-dusting mostly).In order to meet the lowest attractant concentration, the concentration of limonene produced by every device should be (24.8 g/cm^3).The explanations of simulation: In the video above, we built up a simulation model of the movement of nematodes using the cellular automaton in MATLAB.Based on the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment which has been acquired in the first question, we obtain:Considering that odorousness will be reduced with the increase of distance away from the device, we should only consider about the superposed odorousness at point F(considering four equipment now) to reach the lowest attractant concentration.We set the attraction time as 3 days and the distance between two devices is 100 m. As the evenly distribution of nematodes is from 5 cm to 15 cm underground, we put the device into the place which is 10 cm underground.In order to answer these two questions, especially the second one, we need to conduct a simulation of the movement of nematodes to determine the most suitable place in the farmland to place our device.In matrix A, we assume that the device is put on row i and column j (i, j).In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.It shows how nematode moves in a real farmland with the device.We hope this new environment-friendly method, based on principles of synthetic biology, could be shared with and improved by the researchers all over the world.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.Because the movement range of nematodes is within 10cm and the distance between two devices is much longer than 10cm, we can ignore the depth.When the gas diffuses in space, the concentration is not affected by temperature, aerodynamics or other factors.The device emits gas continuously and the concentration is uniform in space.And after the gas diffusion, the attractant concentration will stabilize.Considering that we need to control the density of nematodes in a proper range, we hope to do this by killing all the mature nematodes within certain period of time under the identical condition.(2i+1)(2sqrt{Dt})^{2i+1}}) end{array} end{equation}This is the schematic diagram of our device in a 300m \u00d7 300m farmland according to results of simulation.First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.Thus we obtain:Where C1 is the superposed odorousness diffused from the device, C0 is the lowest attractant concentration.According to Fick s Law, We obtain a 3-D gas diffusion model.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).Orientation of the entomogenous nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae to carbon dioxide[J].Its mathematical expression is as follows:$$frac{partial C(t,x)}{partial t} = D_{A}frac{partial ^2 C(t,x)}{partial x^2}$$C(x,t) is the concentration at the distance of X from gas source in t, N0 is the concentration of gas source, D is the diffusion coefficient.According to the model above, we obtain the gas diffusion model in 3D.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.And we found that the Meloidogyne needs 8.5d-10.5d to develop into second instar larvae from monoplast egg according to an exiting literature[9].And according to the principle of isotropy, we simplify the problem in 1D.We build a gas diffusion model to calculate the gas concentration at each point in matrices.Since the three dimensions have no difference between each other, we simplify the question into a 1-D situation according to isotropy.According to Fick s Law, points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of x Since the three dimension has no difference between each other, we simplify the question into 1-D situation according to isotropy.A brief introduction to the Fick s Law: It points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of X, the change rate of concentration to time is equal to the negative value of the change rate of diffusion flux to distance.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\u0092s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.We will update relevant information about the engineering bacteria we designed to kill the pests in our database.Currently, our database contains the biobrick we established in this project and the one established by team ZJU-CHINA.All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!Liang W, Li Q, Chen L, et al.The proportion of virtual nematode and real nematode is 0.0084.The nematodes is distributed randomly at the beginning.It\u0092s obvious that in this farmland (do not consider points on the sides of the square), point F is the farthest point away from the four equipment.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.And the procedures below were conducted in a fume hood.Step 3.What\u0092s more, squares ABCD are the simplified farmland.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.We will attract nematodes into our device in time d and kill them in time d. We found that all nematodes are killed after two \u0093slaughters\u0094.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.We hope to take a better use of this new environmental-friendly method from the context synthetic biology and share it with researchers all over the world.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.We opened the faucet of the separating funnel in order to let HCl flow into the test tube under the atmospheric pressure.In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on nematode trophic groups in a Chinese paddy-field ecosystem[J].Ye H Y, Ye B P, Wang D Y.

device 2.0 has two shells \u0096 an outer shell and an inner shell.", "notebook": "The goal of our modeling project is to give a best attractant of concentration so that we can determine the most economical plan.We prepared the L-limonene and D-limonene and the synthases expression E. coli (BL21,pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) without standardization of them both, which were cryopreserved with glycerol.We prepared the BW25113 competent cells in terms of the component efficiency kit, and we detected their efficiency of transformation by transforming rfp-PSB1C3 plasmids of different concentration into the cells.We transformed pSB1C3-rMpL into BW25113 competent cells to cultivate on the LB plate and inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the obtained monoclonal colony to produce bacteria solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We revived the limonene synthases expression E. coli strain preserved in glycerol.We assembled bace16-pSB1C3 and transformed it into E. coli DH5?.And we processed nematodes\u0092 chemotaxis replication experiment of limonene as well.We also did expression replication experiments by doing SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample) which came out an obvious band (89kd).We ensured the empty vector plasmid was correct with three groups of restriction digestion.We repeated the induction experiment with different concentration gradient of arabinose as before, while we just collected the precipitation without extracting proteins this time.We built a device all by handwork!We inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the monoclonal colony to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction, and we named the obtained plasmid pUC57-rMpL.We digested the plasmid PSB1C3-RFP sent by iGEM and the pUC57-rMpL with restriction enzyme separately and obtained the PSB1C3 backbone and rMpL gene segment which were connected together later on to assemble the plasmid PSB1C3-rMpL.Together with members majoring in physics, mathematics and biology, we drafted an abstract settlement concentrating on how to simulate the concentration of nematodes in chemotaxis.And we sent plasmids extracted this time for sequencing.We re-prepared the homogenate of the revived E. coli-BL21(pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) for SDS-PAGE and enlarge cultivated the standard bacteria (BL21-pSB1c3) transformed the second time to express the objective product.We transformed bace16-pSB1C3 into the newly obtained BW25113 competent cells to express for another time, and examined the result with SDS-PAGE.We went on the expression experiment of rMpL as above except that we added parallel controll groups whereas canceled the control ones expressed under 37C and prolonged the expression period.After the result of digestion exam was correct we extracted the plasmid and did sequencing, and we transformed the plasmid with correct sequence into E. coli BW25113 to establish expression strain.We activated the preserved culture and enlarge cultivated it in 250 mL conical flask, inducting expression with different concentration gradient of L-arabinose, we collected the precipitation after centrifuging the bacteria solution.Additionally, we learned the life history, growth properities and feeding method of nematodes.We prepared nematodes for enlarge cultivation and induced expression of the LS expression E. coli, and we synchronized a batch of nematodes for verification.We digested rfp-pSB1C3 with two isocaudamas Spe I and Xba I and prepared empty vector plasmid as negative control of whether the desired gene expressed.Since we could get the solution of best concentration of attractant and the diffusion of nematodes, we decided to go towards a further step.We transformed into E. coli DH5? the bace16-pSB1C3 to find that the result of plasmid extraction and enzyme digestion was correct, thus we confirmed the problem was from the expression strain.We re-cultivated the collected bacteria and mixed up the recombined bacteria with the control ones to a certain scale (1:4) to coat on NGM medium, preparing for nematodes cultivation of toxic test.Another important module of our project is to build a database which researchers and even farmers can get information of bio-pesticide easily.Then we recycled the backbone and gene segments following the agarose gel DNA extraction kit and linked them to produce plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3 and d-limonene-pSB1C3.We continued to watch the movement of nematodes under toxic test, where the nematodes of M9 group was generally active, partly died of bace16 and heated bace16 groups, and acted normally in pSB1C3 group.Another SDS-PAGE of extracellular proteins extract was run while the objective band was still not observed.However, we still failed to observe obvious expression of rMpL, against which we suspected there occurred something wrong with the expression bacteria and planed to change bacteria strain to express de novo.We put the database on the github.com and it can be edited and added new items by all users.We transferred plasmids with correct sequenced d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS gene into expression strain E. coli BL21 respectively to express LS and GPPS.The problem was confirmed to be from the expression strain as mentioned above, so we adopted a new strain of BW25113 and continued our experiment.We enlarge cultivated the standard LS expression bacteria (E. coli-BW2513-pSB1C3) and expressed the objective produce (in contrast with empty vector).Congratulations!We tried some simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation to be familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We designed parts rMpL and bace16 by adding pBAD promoter (BBa_K206000) and RBS(BBa_B0034) to the upstream region of rMpL gene and bace16 gene, and we committed the GENEWIZ company to synthesize the rMpL and bace16 gene segment.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.So we re-transformed the plasmids from the company into E. coli DH5?and BL21 separately and did all the cultivation, plasmid extraction, enzyme digestion de novo to make sure the examine result correct.The results of SDS-PAGE suggested that d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS were expressed successfully.Incubate the bacteria with 8 (mu)M, 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose , run SDS-PAGE after ammonium sulfate precipitation.Change the E. coli strain to express rMpL, only add 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose for incubation this time.To test if rMpL is expressed in the pallet or the supernatant, ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to enrich the protein.using Ultrasonication and SDS-PAGE are also used during this process.This week we discussed factors that would influence the putting model of equipment on the farmland.So we extracted the bace16-pSB1C3 from the expression strain BW25113 for restriction enzyme digestion and no objective band was extracted still.We inoculated the obtained monoclonal colony into 10 mL centrifuge tubes to produce bacterium solution for plasmid extraction, the enzyme digestion result of which was incorrect that a band around 500~750 bp appeared whereas the backbone band lost.We examined the extracted plasmid with enzyme digestion, no objective band observed as a result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry powder.However, we regrettably observed that the effect of expression is not ideal from the SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis of both the homogenate and the supernatant.We realized that our original assumption that we regarded nematodes as static models couldn t react to some essential properties of nematode moving.We transformed the plasmid rfp-pSB1C3(BBa_J04450) in DH5? and proceeded amplification to obtain the standard plasmid backbone.We prepared some common used reagent such as TAE, antibiotics and LB cultural medium.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.We extracted the plasmid and did restriction enzyme digestion to test and verify the plasmid backbone PSB1C3, and preserve the correct plasmid for subsequent experimental use.We designed the sequence of Limonene synthase (LS) that would be transformed to E. coli to express.Our designed sequences were based on the two cDNA sequences of LS expression sequence--Citrus unshiu CitMTSE1 for d-limonene synthase and Mentha spicata 4S-limonene synthase, together with prefix and suffix codes and restriction enzyme cutting site were sent to the company for optimum synthesis.We obtained the plasmid of gene rMpL with PUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.The results verified that compound limonene could attract nematodes preliminarily.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria of experimental group and control group.We did SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample), no significant difference observed between the bands.In addition, the differences between bands of BW25113 and BL21 were obvious when ran SDS-PAGE together whereas the objective band of BW25113 couldn t be ensured.We expressed bace16 protein twice and prolonged the expression period to overnight.At the same time, we carried out the experiment of attractive interactions of limonene towards nematodes several times.Third, we had built a basic frame of the database.Sequencing gene l-limonene and d-limonene synthesized by the company to get an unsatisfactory result, we speculated that these plasmids were extracted from the wrong BW25113.Also we improved our device and made a 3D model of it, which we called Device 2.0.To verify whether limonene had been synthesized by bacteria, the fermentation broth was tested by GC-MS in School of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University.According to pair t test, we concluded that limonene could attract nematodes.According to the original paper, rMpL is soluble protein expressed inside the cell, so target protein should be still in pallets.The correct plasmids examined with restricton enzyme digestion was preserved in -20\u00b0, named l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57.We digested the plasmid pSB1C3-RFP from iGEM as well as l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57 separately with restriction enzymes to get pSB1C3 backbone and the two gene segments, among which the brightness of pSB1C3 backbone band was quite weak.That\u0092s why we had to make it by hands.We tried another protocol of replication experiment as increasing the amount of sample whereas the effect was still not ideal indicated by the statistical result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.Considering there are so many factors can\u0092t be predicted in the real situation, we talked about how to idealize and simplify our putting model.In order to testify if engineering bacteria have the ability to express limonene, amplification cultured bacteria liquid covered with n-hexane was cultured in the shaking table to express production.Inhibition is observed on the plate inoculated with recombinat bacteria.Through a lot of discussion among our group, and with accumulating realization and knowledge of this program, we finally came up with a method to solve the problem of how to place equipment we made on the farmland.We optimized the protocol of replication experiment on and on, and the growth condition of nematodes is favorable.Finally, we chose traditional technology to produce devices in the future if it was verified that our device had high value of application.At the same time, we make the model revision.Run SDS-PAGE and get bands which might be rMpL.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria.Still, we failed to observe objective band at all the supernatant of bacteria, homogenate and supernatant of ultrasonic broken cells.We induced expression of rMpL continuously with arabinose in concentration gradient to acquire a stable expression condition.Meanwhile, it appeared to be some problems of other groups\u0092 digestion too, against which we speculated that the cause may be the pollution of reagent, star activity or something wrong with the expression strain.GENEWIZ gave us the relevant feedback in time and modified the two sequences to synthesize again.We did the simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation again to be further familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We started to work on it.We transformed the obtained plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3?d-limonene-pSB1C3 into E. coli BW25113 and cultivated 10mL centrifuge tube with them to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We found the gene sequence of bace16(AAV3D0845) and the cDNA sequence of MpL(GeneBank accession number HQ449739) from the Genebank, and optimized the coded sequences in E. coli.After we determined the theme of our project, we recuited more undergraduates from related colleges, including college of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.Second, the device we had made actually was not applicable enough, which required further improvement.No positive results are observed in 4 days.Cultivate recombinant bacteria, bacteria with empty vector or OP50 bacteria for nematoxicity test of rMpL protein.As we discussed the influencing factors last week, our main work this week was to search documents to see what exact influence these factors would bring to our result, and whether these factors can be ignored or idealized.After being amplification cultured and expressing aiming products, the bacteria were smashed by ultrasonication.However, the cost of product by 3D print is too high.We also transferred empty pSB1C3 plasmids into expression strain E. coli BL21 and regarded them as the control group.Finally our plan is to design and build a debug device.We cultivated nematodes and proceeded synchronization, and we did replication experiment of baiting nematodes with linalool using pure chemical compound (linalool).", "protocol": "Incubate upside down at 37\u00b0C overnight.Flush nematodes from the plate with M9, centrifugate (1500 r.p.m, 3min), abandon the supernatant and resuspend the precipitation with 3mL M9.Add 500(mu)L resuspended solution to the NGM plate inoculated with mixed E.coli as mentioned above as experimental group and NGM plate with blank E.coli as control group.Make 3 repeats of each concentration.Flush nematode from the plate with M9 and inoculate 20 (mu)L (about 30 nematodes) into the center of the medium.Inoculate 5mL LB liquid mediums added Chl with experimental group E.coli BW25113 (transformed with rMpl or bace16 genes) and blank control group separately.37\u00b0C incubate overnight.Observe and compare the activation and size of nematodes of each group and draw a conclusion.Autoclave the above mentioned reagents with 120\u00b0C for 30 min and then water bath them to 65\u00b0C.Add 1ml cholesterol, CaCl2, MgSO4 and 25 mL phosphoric acid buffer into the minimum medium in order (all at 65\u00b0C, shake up).Streak inoculate OP50 on LB solid

set a series of concentration gradient of attractant.Divide the NGM solid medium (d = 6 cm) equally into two parts (drawing on the surface of the culture dishes).Put 50 (mu)L compound of different concentration and DMSO as contrast respectively on the two parts.Cut down a square of NGM(about 1cm x 1cm) with nematodes.Put the square on the NGM medium with OP50 and let the surface with nematodes adown to contact the medium.Watch the growth condition of nematodes under the stereoscope everyday and re-inoculate every 4 to 5 days to avoid the nematodes growing too densely.For inoculating abundant nematodes rapidly, or changing plate to provide more food and better condition for them, we can flush them with M9 and centrifuge them with 1500 r.m.p for 1 min, and incubate the precipitate on a new plate.Grow slowly at 16\u00b0C and grow fast at 25\u00b0C while egg laying amount declines.Inoculate NGM medium with 150~200 (mu)L OP50, incubate at 37\u00b0C for 12hr.", "result": "2) occurs inBased on the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP in the pathways mentioned above, GPP synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation between IPP and DMAPP to synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the burden for E. coli, so in our research, we transferred both GPPS gene and LS gene into theIn our project we decided to use E. coli, MEP pathway to express limonene.We then add 5?L 5% limonene (T) and DMSO (C) respectively at the two small circular filters in the experimental groups(Fig.This proves that many terpenes can attract plant-parasitic nematodes in naturalSome researches showed that limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\u0092s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many kinds of volatiles to induce nematodes that are harmful to these predators.We put two small pieces of circular filter paper 2.5cm from the center of the circle (Fig.Later we add 30?L suspension of the nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\u00a0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.", "safety": "In addition, we established a photoinduced bidirectional transcription system regulated by light, where we can divide the process of attracting and killing nematodes into two periods to realize the relatively timing and quantitative release of the toxic proteins, bringing down the retention in the environment.Thirdly, a suicide system was constructed based on the principles of quorum sensing in microorganisms which would enable us to control the bacterial colony density artificially and therefore the quantity of engineering bacteria can be maintained in a stable and controllable range.Considering the biosafety, we improved device 2.0 into a relatively closed unit, and we also designed a dome to cover the medium.(Fig.1)We replaced GFP and RFP with limonene synthase and toxic protein respectively, so the release of the two proteins can be regulated by gp35 directly, and by light signals indirectly.Generally speaking, the Switch system works in this way--provide the system with light of wavelength in 600nm at first so gene gp35 will be repressed and the system will express the chemical attractants like limonene.In conclusion, the significance of our system is that we have built a photoinduced bidirectional system to avoid a simultaneous and strong expression of the bait and toxic proteins, in which way we can avoid the potential harm done to environment by the system.We not only considered the potential safety problem caused by the high expression of the toxic protein and attractant, but also designed a suicide system for our engineering bacterias to solve the problem by regulating the population size of our bacterias.We built our system based on the phenomenon of quorum sensing[1].In addition, replacement as well as remove of medium and engineering bacteria would all be done in the labs or safety rooms of factories which guarantee relative closure of the device used in farmland and avoid engineering bacteria spreading.Although Bace16 and rMpL are both toxic proteins towards nematodes specially, the over expression of these proteins can also break the ecological equilibrium inevitably.While when the concentration of attractants reaches a certain point (see modeling part), we would turn off the light to trigger the expressing of protein gp35 to push the system work in a reverse direction so that the toxic protein would be expressed.In addition, after the engineering bacteria works, the device would be recycled and the residual bacteria would be disinfected.3.Is it safer, cheaper, or better than other technologies that do the same thing?We concluded the action objects and disadvantages of various traditional nematicides of China according to related literatures, and the result is shown below.High toxicity Do harm to the soil, the environment even the health.This complex can bind with promoter luxpR, after which the transcription of mazf gene in the downstream will be triggered and bacterias will be killed by toxin protein MazF[2].Firstly, we designed a device to cultivate E.coli inside and restricted their movement at the same time, thus preventing the difussion of our engineering bacteria to soil.Will it be sterilized, discarded, or recycled?Our device is designed to be recyclable so the growing state can be checked at regular intervals, which means once something wrong happens, we can adjust the bacterial colony timely.With the biosynthesis of PCB, Cph8 can serve as a photoreceptor that regulates gene expression through PompC.In order to regulate the direction of promoter J23110 under the light signal, an integrase, gp35, is added to the upstream region of the PompC promoter.We constructed two main circuits.When gp35 expresses, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.Cph1 is a member of the plant photoreceptor family.As for environmental safety, on one hand, we design a semi-closed device to avoid the spread of engineering bacterias in which way we could increase the safety level and improve the attracting and killing efficiency of our bacteria; On the other hand, light-regulated bidirectional transcription system can avoid over-expression of toxin proteins, and the design of suicide part can regulate the population density of engineering bacteria.This system can be divided into three main parts: photoinduced system, bidirectional transcriptional system and bait-killer system.The red light sensor (Cph8) is a fusion protein which consists of a phytochrome Cph1 and a histidine kinase domain, Envz-OmpR.The first one expresses gp35 serine integrase,(Fig.1) which can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP, the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome.All in all, biosafety is ensured in both the developing and the application stage of our project.1.At first, the plasmid expresses GFP.It is probably do harm to the crops.It is suitable for the burst of the nematodes disasters.Next it is beneficial to the creatures who live in the environment suffering serious nematodes disasters because the traditional nematicides do harm to human.For instance, all team members in the lab should wear clothes for lab-use, wear gloves and work in the super clean bench when necessary; poison reagent should be used in the fuming cupboard; and the waste liquid and medium should be poured or thrown differently.", "keywords": "Xochimilco formaldehyde Sclerotite temperature components hydrolysis saccharification post-staining resistance expression", "track":

the degradation of insecticide pyrethroids is 3-phenoxybenzoate (3-PBA).Because of the wide use of pyrethroids and the stability of the diarylether compound itself, 3-PBA is typically detected as an important environmental contaminant.The main metabolite in the degradation of insecticide pyrethroids is 3-phenoxybenzoate (3-PBA) which is is typically detected as an important environmental contaminant[1].Through searching a large number of papers and analyzing data, we found that the harms of 3-PBA are as follows:The half life period of 3-PBA is about 180 days , longer than most of pyrethroids, making it difficult to be degraded in the environment.Hindering the mineralization of pyrethroids?which cut off the biodegradation pathway that pesticide is transformed into non-toxic (poisonousless) small molecule.3-PBA is an important material in chemical industryTo analyze the toxicity of the 3-PBA, we used fruit fly to test.Our device is designed to degrade 3-phenoxybenzoatecompletelyFig2.The passway of biodegradation of 3-pba in our engineering bacteriaCopA, the principal copper effluxATPase in Escherichia coli, is induced by elevated copper in the medium[1].Gene cluster pbaA1A2B and gene pbaC encode the 3-phenoxybenzoate 1 ,2 -dioxygenase,which is an angular dioxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation in the 1 and 2  positions of the benzene moiety of 3-phenoxybenzoate(3-PBA)[4], yielding 3-hydroxybenzoate(3-HBA)[5] and catechol.D .Changes in fluorescenceintensity in E.coli which do not contain copA promoter comparing with two strains.We placed insulator RiboJ between copA promoter and RBS(Fig.5).Fig.5.Two device used to detect copper in solution, the upper device has riboJ and the under one has no riboJ.Catechol , an intermediate metabolite of 3-PBA, is toxic to the Escherichia coli.Output ( fluorescence) depended only on the activity of copA promoter when be induced, and not the sequence at the part junction.In the lab, we aim to realize the biodegradation of 3-PBA using recombinant plasmid.By measuring fluorescence intensity in cells by flow cytometer,we got data to analyze sensitivity and specificity of copA promoter.In our experiment, copA promoter was induced by different concentration of copper ion (37.5umol/L, 50umol/L, 62.5umol/L, 75umol/L) .We tested 3-PBA s influence on reproductive capacity of fruit fly, and found that 3-PBA can affect the normal secreting of sex hormone.We counted the number of the new imagoes hatched by flies that were fed in medium with 3-PBA before.In comparison of two graphs A, B, we can obviously find that the degradation of protein is much faster in DH5? than that in BL21 (DE3)?because BL21 (DE3) has a deficiency of protease.CopA promoter is active in the presence of copper ion.We intended to character copA promoter independently.Actually, the fluorescence which produced by the leakage of copA will not change.The change quantity comes from the different growth periods of the E.coli.In the group of 0?mol/L Cu2+, the fluorescence shows a trend of falling firstly then rising(Fig.3C).So bacteria will go through a period of growing from growth period to maturation period, so as to the change of the fluorescence.Maturation period is great period for the expression of protein.The genes pbaC-pbaA1A2B-c23o-mhbDHIM, encoding enzymes of the 3-phenoxybenzoate degradation pathway were successfully built finally.and the whole metabolic pathway is shown in Fig2..Fig1.Based on these facts we can get a formula Net proceeds(N)=Benefit(B)-Cost(C).Simplest genetic circuit ---our small step to degradationWe used constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) to transcribe downstream genes including gene cluster pbaA1A2B and C23O.Insecticide pyrethroids are widely used in the agricultural production to control the insect pest.However, the efficiency of removal of these compounds by bacteria is actually low for they evolve on the basis of environmental fitness rather than degradation efficiency.Therefore , we utilized RiboJ which was placed between promoter and protein coding sequence to eliminate the interference of two different parts.However, according to our preliminary experiment , Sphingobiumwenxiniae JZ-1T is easy to lose the ability of degradation and cannot grow in LB medium containing high concentration of 3-PBA.Fig.3.A.Changes in fluorescenceintensity induced by different concentration of copper ion in E.coli BL21 (DE3).RiboJ can reliably maintain relative promoter strengths.We test copA promoter in BL21 (DE3),DH5?.CopA promoter has relative leaky basal expression by comparing the negative control\u0092s output and basal leakage of copA promoter in E. coli expression systems(Fig.4).As a metabolite, 3-PBA is easy to be ignored by people.", "design": "Sphingobium wenxiniae JZ-1 was designed to put into the unit to degrade pyrethroids.Meeting the standard of farmland discharge in China main landAccording to the urban sewage treatment method , sedimentation , sludge treatment , disinfecton[5] can cut down the index value to meet the standard.Fig.The screen shoot cut for the 3D vision of the physcial unit*The whole unit is divided into five rooms and they are numbered separately (the second room is under the first room; number 5 is not marked and the fifth room is near the fourth room from right to left orientation ) and all the plates used to separate the unit into five rooms are covered by the 0.22?m bacterial membrane to prevent the bacterial escape.On the bottom of the first room there is acticarbon to pretreat the water to be purified.Both 3-PBA and pyrethroids can be found in the run off water.For being eager to take the first steps to make our project real, we designed a physcial unit applied in the field to purify farmland runoff water (regarded as the main factor of agricultral pollution[1]) including 3-PBA and pyrethroids.Through farmland investigation, we found runoff water from cropland was seldom collected and purified.3) The ponds can collect the contaminant [4].To put the engineered bacteria into practice, some issues have to be handled.Meeting the standard of farmland discharge in China main land3-PBA comes from its parent compounds pyrethroids which are more frequently touched by the public and also is used as a generic biomarker for multiple pyrethroids exposure for pyrethroid residues in the environment.Set a man-made pond(?) to collect pyrethroids and 3-PBA and the physical unit(?) is beside the pond.The unit is pumped.The physical unit will be put into the places applied pyrethroids to achieve its value.2) people in the research institutes always want to use plant ryegrass and photinia fraseri to lighten contamination[3].Based on documents, we found 1) people had no idea about farmland runoff water disposal [2].Between the pond and the place applied pyrethroids(?) there is a moderate climb(?) to help the pyrethroids and 3-PBA collecting.Avoiding to pollute the drinking water source the man-made pond should be at least away from the water source 90 meters.The third room is used to cut down the BOD and COD index value applying yeast and Actinobacillus.Based on our questionnaire, about 10% of interviewees come from rural areas, but only 3.5% of the whole interviewees know that pyrethroids are widely used pesticides

Pesticide interactions; Effects of organ phosphorus pesticides on the metabolism, toxicity, and persistence of selected pyrethroid insecticides[J].Under natural conditions, pyrethroid pesticides are hard to degrade, while their long-term accumulation leads to accumulated toxicity, contributing to chronic diseases[4], neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity[5].Pyrethroid pesticides are also used as domestic insect repellents.Among them, the active ingredient of insect repellent fragrance is \"diethyltoluamide\", while that of the other products is pyrethroids.Our NAU iGEM team member investigated in supermarket the components of certain insect repellent products as indicated by the user survey.This preliminary research provides good ideas to our questionnaire design.According to literature review, we know that pyrethroid insecticides are widely and heavily used in our life due to their large application scope.By way of literature review, we know that pyrethroids are important ingredients of mosquito coil, electric mosquito mat, electric mosquito liquid, etc., expect for insect repellent fragrance.The analysis results are as follows:The survey shows that most insect repellent users choose insect repellent fragrance, mosquito coil and electric mosquito liquid.Some exposure to pyrethroid pesticides may not have effects on ordinary adults, but to fetuses and infant, the same exposure may cause severe developmental disorders.The correct way to buy and use pyrethroid pesticide properly, the way to reduce pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits and measures to take after pyrethroid pesticide poisoning, etc.Chronicillness as a result of low-level exposure to synthetic pyrethroid insecticides: a review of the debate.27.50% of the respondents use up more than 1 bottle (box) of insect repellent product throughout a summer.All these data show that humans have frequent and long-term exposure to pyrethroid insecticides.[3] WOLANSKY M J, HARRILL J A. Neurobehavioral toxicology of pyrethroid insecticides in adult animals: A critical review[J].[1-3] .Recent studies have shown that pyrethroid pesticides are not low-toxic and safe as expected.They are proved effective both in crop pest control of vegetables and fruit trees and as domestic insecticides in killing mosquitoes, cockroaches, head lice, etc.", "modeling": "How to reduce the pressure of the environment?We have the idea that the expression of non-essential protein and the metabolic structure will influence metabolic rate and genetic stability.To varify the idea, In our model we focused on quantitative analysis of the pathway involved in the degradation metabolism of 3-pba in E.coli.This type of analysis of cellular metabolism can be used to gain a better understanding of the adding pathway\u0092s influence in E.coli and identify key targets for genetic manipulation that could enhance the degradation pathway.Left is the main metabolic network in E.coli while right is the engineering E.coli in our project.By benefits and cost analysis,we can know the metabolic burden of producing these extra proteins while by MCA we can learn the control structure of the metabolic network so as to do an efficient adjustment.So in our work we didn\u0092t take care of the concentration of PYR.In our work,we will discuss the modeling in three aspects?dynamic model,benefits and cost analysis and metabolic control analysis(MCA).The development of a dynamic model can help us learn the dynamic change within the cell and the control structure.Assumption: regulate the expression of non-essential protein and the metabolic structure will gain a fast metabolic rate and better genetic stability.Fischer, E. and U.

uranium adsorption and recovery - we needed a protein polymer network which contains several functional modules.To address these drawbacks, the Peking iGEM team put forward the Uranyl Reaper project, which aimed to develop an innovative method to deal with uranium pollution.In order to achieve this goal, we designed an extraordinary biological adsorption polymer network which was produced by engineered bacteria and self-assembled completely autonomously.How to collect the protein polymer network together with the adsorbed uranyl from the environment?Impressively, in a trial where the concentration of uranyl was set at 10?M, the polymer network with the SUP module was able to sequester nearly 90% of total uranyl ions within just one minute.The fusion proteins could be brought to their working concentration by concentrating them directly in the culture supernatants, and the resulting crude concentrates could be used directly for the ultimate goal - the Uranium Reaper.Inspired by the autocatalytic formation of the isopeptide bond between a Lys and an Asp residue in the CnaB2 protein from S. pyogenes, researchers engineered a pair of complementary truncations of CnaB2, called SpyTag and SpyCatcher1.the results indicated that the crosslinking reaction between the Triple SpyCatcher and fusion proteins could be completed in 1 hour.Considering that uranium mainly exists as uranyl ion and its carbonate in aqueous solution, we applied the Super Uranyl Binding Protein (SUP), which was designed specifically to bind uranyl via structural calculation and functional modification.Finally, signal sequences derived from OmpA, LTIIb and PhoA were found to be efficient mediators for the secretion of our recombinant proteins.Whether in E. coli or B. subtilis, secretory proteins usually contain signal peptides that are essential for their export from the cytoplasm.Which signal peptide would best promote the secretion of our constructs was inscrutable, so a library was built in order to screen for the most suitable candidates.In view of existing as well as potential future uranium pollution, the current complicated, time-consuming, inefficient and expensive treatment methods seem woefully out-of-date.[1]Zakeri, B., et al., Peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein, through engineering a bacterial adhesin.A schematic graph of the whole project is shown in Fig.", "human_practice": "The Brochure designed for public education about the project, synthetic biology and iGEM.Additionally, we popularized iGEM among middle school students from the 2016 Peking University Alumni Children\u0092s Summer Camp (Fig.After learning about the public opinion on uranium, uranium pollution, and synthetic biology, we decided to design a popular science brochure (Fig.Uranyl concentrations in water from Weiming Lake and in coal-washing wastewater  In order to assess whether there are potential dangers in our immediate vicinity, we extracted freshwater samples from Weiming Lake on campus and coal-washing wastewater from Shan Xi province, and measured the uranyl concentrations of the water samples by ICP-MS.It could thus be demonstrated that we had no need to worry too much about the effects of uranium pollution in daily life because the amount of uranium around us was within the normal range even in an otherwise quite polluted environment, such as around coal-mining operations.Additionally, we also measured the intensity of radiation in the nuclear environmental chemistry laboratory where we did the experiments with uranyl-containing solutions.), with the aim of helping them to develop a passion for biology, life sciences and synthetic biology.During this summer camp, there was a team coming to visit our lab and they were quite interested in the routine work of the iGEM team (Fig.In addition to the questionnaire survey and interviews of front-end units and experts, we have done more work related to social practice.Interestingly, the radiation intensity value in the work area was close to that determined in the playground, which could be regarded as the background value.Both were well within the drinking-water standard of the EPA which states that the amount of uranium shall not exceed 30 ?g/L, or about 126 nM1.", "modeling": "They made it a way to choose the monomers suitable for crosslinking reaction.The Peking iGEM Team has studied and expanded Paul J.

(Learn more) Demonstrated effective adsorption of uranyl ions by monomeric Triple SpyTag-SUP or polymer network containing the SUP module under a number of conditions.(Learn more) We visited experts from the College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and School of Physics of Peking University, respectively, to learn about the current situation surrounding uranium pollution in the real world and how people could control the situation.This way we could compare the methods they were using with the Uranium Reaper strategy.In the protein polymeric network, the concentration of enzymes could be increased and the efficiency of biocatalysis may consequently also be enhanced.If we optimize the number of SpyTag or SpyCatcher modules per protein monomer, as well as the working concentrations of proteins, we may make protein-3D printing using the Spy Crosslinking Network come true.Links to detailed lab results could also be found on these pages.We submitted 53 high-quality and

special software which could be used to calculate the molecular weight distribution of protein polymers using Flory\u0092s theory.", "safety": "We did not make any contact with genuine, and thus potentially dangerous, pollution samples from the field.Because the bacteria used to produce and secrete the proteins were sequestered in enclosed environments, such as fermenters, and we plan on only using the proteins instead of live bacteria to deal with pollution in the environment, we did not add a kill-switch in this project.What we did ourselves was only to use the simulated pollution scenes for the proof-of-principle test in the Bio-safety Level 2 iGEM lab, which means that we never made any contact with genuine, potentially dangerous pollution samples from the field.As mentioned above, the DNA parts are absolutely safe because they encode non-hazardous proteins such as SpyCatcher, SpyTag, SUP, mSA and their combinations.Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experimentThe original intention of the project was to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized material to deal with uranium pollution in the environment.The bench work followed some basic regulations as below:Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission was strictly prohibited.All involved participants needed to understand the experiment completely before commencing work.Any steps involving potential release of live microorganisms were performed in a bio-safety cabinet.Appliances such as Bunsen burners, electric heaters and microwave ovens were not left unattended while in use.All liquid and solid waste potentially containing living organism was sterilized.The entire lab was sterilized using UV-light every week.The last person to leave the lab always made sure that water, electricity, gas, and the air conditioner were shut down, and doors and windows have been locked before leaving.For the proof-of principle test, all uranyl solutions were prepared by specially trained professional researchers in the Nuclear Environmental Chemistry Group of Peking University.Additionally, the bacterial hosts are laboratory strains which are likely to be highly uncompetitive compared wild bacteria in the outside environment.During the utilization of the bio-functional polymer network, uranyl ions are enriched to a high concentration, which is a potential cause for concern.This year\u0092s Peking iGEM Team is trying to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized biomaterial to deal with uranium pollution in the environment, using the methods of synthetic biology.In order to prove the usefulness of the concept, we did a series of experiments using simulated pollution scenes which were constructed by dissolving uranyl nitrate hexahydrate either in TBS buffer or in environmental water samples from the Weiming Lake on campus and the Bohai Sea.The strains are restricted to the lab so that the cells produce the Uranium Reaper system are continuously under rigorous control without any possibility to contact the outside environment.All media that had come in contact with bacteria were sterilized to prevent any escape of microbes.According to the requirements of iGEM policy we never performed any dangerous experiments in daily bench work or faced any unusual safety issues.The characteristics of these parts had been described in detail in previous work, and all part collections, such as the signal peptide library were derived from parts that are nonpathogenic and harmless to humans or the environment.Almost all the parts in the project were modified from pre-existing iGEM parts, such as SUP, LBP and so on.It is thus conclusive that none of the parts would raise any safety issues according to current professional knowledge.", "keywords": "TAT-Apoptin antibiotics mechanical encryption calcitonin LC-Cutinase fusicoccin tetracycline controlled polystyrene", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite":

(perfluorooctanoic acid).Due to strong binding energy of carbon-fluorine bond, these compounds are very difficult to be degraded in nature and they also accumulate in organism, causing harm to the environment and human.Since there\u0092s no regulation for banning PFCs usage and emission in most countries all over the world nowadays, environmental organizations, government and scientists have discovered liquid and volatile PFCs distribution in waters, in snow, in the air, and even in drinking water.Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), including PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooactanesulfonic acid), are hazardous man-made chemicals produced or used in industry and daily necessities.[3] PFOA, one of the most studied PFCs, has been detected in adults  bodies around the world.Mutation Research / Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis Genotoxic potential of the perfluorinated chemicals PFOA , PFOS , PFBS , PFNA and PFHxA in human HepG2 cells.Therefore, we hope to develop an efficient and eco-friendly method to keep the world from PFCs disaster.Our goal is to break carbon-fluorine bonds in PFOA.[7] Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident

concentration of PFCs in the liver.[2] In USA, Environmental Working Group (EWG) even showed statistics of PFCs pollution levels in every state.Hence, we assumed that fac-dex is the key to degrading PFOA.In the process breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released.Besides, tons of researches show that PFCs potentially cause diseases to animals and human.High concentration of PFCs have been detected in Pearl River and Yangtze River in China and some lakes in USA since 2007.We also insert a fluoride transporter gene, CRCB[9], to help our modified E.coli survive.There are two goals in our experiment: Degradation of PFOA and transportation of fluoride.What\u0092s worse, researches have suggested that PFOA is link to several disease.Groups of Scientists conducted researches on animals and found that animals which were fed with PFOA, end up with their thymus, spleens, and livers enlarged, possibly tumorous.FA1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens are able to degrade PFOA producing fluoride.[4] Because of its hydrophobicity, PFOA can stay in human body for a long time.", "design": "Meanwhile, escaping engineered bacteria will be killed for biosafety.As for PFOA bioremediation basin, we referred to the structure of current secondary treatment basin and set up a prototyping model.The best way to stop PFOA pollution caused by industrial wastewater is to remove PFOA in the wastewater before it is released into the environment.For the purpose of preventing PFOA from leaking to the enironment, we developed a bioreactor system.We designed a bioreactor and named it \u0093 PFOA bioremediation basin.\u0094 Following is a sketch of our reactor.To develop a more complete bioreactor system, we plan to integrate our own device, PFOA bioremediation basin, into the current industrial wastewater treatment process in the factory producing PFOA wastewater.First, wastewater passes through RO membrane, so that PFOA in the wastewater becomes more concentrated.Once the concentration of PFOA gets higher, the efficiency of our system can be lifted.Next, after some adjustments, such as PH value and temperature, to make the wastewater a proper environment for bacteria to grow, wastewater enters our device, PFOA bioremediation basin.After being processed in PFOA bioremediation basin, wastewater is added with calcium chloride solution of high concentration, so that fluoride, which is the predicted byproduct of PFOA degradation, can be precipitated.In addition, wastewater is set to stay in the basin for a period of time to undergo PFOA degradation performed by engineered bacteria.We apply computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to predict real situation of our project.", "human_practice": "Thanks to their help, we finally finished our provision before

completely inhibited.First, we cultured the BL21 overnight, and then added IPTG to induce Crcb, Bpe, Fluc expression.Second, we added different concentration of sodium fluoride (NaF) and used ELISA to detect the value of OD 600.We think that if Fluoride transporter work, the bacteria will grow better.Result: Compared with no plasmid control, we found a significant-different with 0.08M and 0.1M [NaF].Based on fluoride-concentration-time graph from sample of modified E.coli (BL21 with Fac-dex) and PFOA of 500 ppm initially, we can tell that the concentration of fluoride increases in time due to the performance of PFOA degradation.With the technic of SDS-PAGE, we can test if our plasmid can be expressed properly in E.coli or not.We separately induced 8 different E.coli culture that had be transformed the Fac-dex gene.From the growth curves, we found that PFOA has little influence on the growth of E.coli.In our experiment, after we transformed our plasmid into E.coli, we induced the expression of Fac-dex gene.After Fac-dex breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released, leading to the increase of fluoride concentration in waterTherefore, by detecting the fluoride concentration with Fluorine Ion Selective Electrode in time, we can know the extent of PFOA degradation by Fac-dex.Then the induced E.coli was transferred into new tube containing LB with different concentration of PFOA (As below).We use same E.coli which hadn\u0092t been induced as the negative control in lane 1.In conclusion, there are extra protein being expressed in the E.coli culture of lane 4, 5, 6, 7.If the gene is able to be induced, there should be a large quantity of Fac-dex existed in E.coli.We used the induced E.coli culture as our samples.BL21 with Fluoride transporter, grew better than control.Conclusion: First, the four figures show that if the environmental fluoride concentration increases, the bacteria which express fluoride transporter can growth better.It manifests that Fac-dex can successfully degrade PFOA and release fluoride.We inoculate starter culture at a 1:100 dilution into LB containing NaF with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.The result is as below?From the growth curve, we know that under 20mM of sodium fluoride, E.coli is able to grow normally.We cultured E.coli in liquid medium (3 ml LB and 5 ml E.coli broth) containing PFOA with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.Under 60mM of sodium fluoride, the growth curve shifted slightly.Our maybe because the amount of our engineered bacteria added in wastewater isn t many enough to work in such amount of wastewater.We also added Mg+2 as the cofactor of Fac-dex.From the result above, the F- released by PFOA degradation is not detectable for PFOA concentration below 100(ppm), 0~12 hours.We induced E.coli culture that had be transformed the Fac-dex gene.So we can t test the fluoride concentrate solely and efficiently.So, we will use

of countless human beings by controlling the population of both agricultural and urban pests, since the second half of last century, the numbers of insecticide resistant pests have been rising at an alarming rate [1].Though they might have succeeded in increasing the potency or hardiness of a fungus specie, they did not take a step further to consider that the evaluation the fungal insecticide must follow before commercialization, which includes the assessment of its toxicity towards humans and animals, dispersal, horizontal gene transfer rate, and its effects on the resident microflora [5].In reality, the amount of insecticides applied is actually proportional to the increase in resistance in the target pest population [2], [3].Some would argue that as researchers and chemical pesticide companies develop new insecticides, the resistance couldn\u0092t possibly catch up.Currently, the biopesticides that are the most widespread, in terms of usage, are the entomopathogenic-fungi insecticides[4].Using an entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, that is applied as an insecticide around the world as our chassis, we have constructed a genetically modified M. anisopliae with wildtype lethality and the additional ability to self-terminate after killing its host.1.nutrition and immune response) conditions [5].Many researchers have tried to improve these fungal insecticides through biochemical or genetic means [6], [7].This means if no action is taken to change the status quo, the ongoing population control of insect pest will become even more of a struggle.Biopesticides, including insecticidal plant extract, bacteria, and fungi, are some of the more popular alternatives to chemical pesticides.Reid, M. C., & McKenzie, F. E. (2016).St Leger, R., Joshi, L., Bidochka, M. J., & Roberts, D. W. (1996).Zhu, F., Lavine, L., O\u0092Neal, S., Lavine, M., Foss, C., & Walsh, D.

6349\u00966354.7.To address this problem, we, 2016 NYMU_Taipei, have designed a light-induced kill switch aimed to reduce the dispersal and horizontal gene transfer of genetically engineered fungal insecticides.Insecticide Resistance and Management Strategies in Urban Ecosystems.Insects, 7(1), 2.3.Certain species of entomopathogenic fungi are capable of targeting a small range of hosts, making them the ideal solution to many regional insect pests.Wang CS, St Leger RJ (2007) A scorpion neurotoxin increases the potency of a fungal insecticide.However, these biological control agents come with highly variable outcomes due to the variation in environmental (e.g.", "description": "This year we characterized and developed the part BBa_K1184000, phototoxic protein KillerRed, and a fungal selection marker gene bar BBa_K1021003.We characterized this part with thermal stability assay.KillerRed protein was extracted from transformed E.coli and a control group of empty vector was set to eliminate the influence of other proteins.This test aims to show the temperature influence on KillerRed protein by measuring its fluorescence after being treated for 2 hours at the following temperatures: 70, 70.5, 71.7, 73.5, 75.5, 78.3, 81, 83.6, 86, 88, 89.5, 92.2 (degree Celsius).", "design": "Utilizing PMcl1 from M. anisopliae, a promoter with fast activation and high production rate, high amounts of KillerRed protein with SV40 NLS will be produced and transported to the nucleus.Utilizing the promoter of PMcl1 in genetically engineering Metarhizium allows the expression of target genes to be limited to the hemocoel of the fungus  host insects, ensuring the specificity of gene expression[2].The KillerRed protein is a red fluorescent protein with excitation and emission maxima at 585 and 610 nm respectively.Through the utilization of different gene expression and location of M. anisopliae cells during different stages of its infection cycle alongside with light-induced phototoxic fluorescent proteins, we aim to design entomopathogenic-fungi-specific killswitch that can greatly mitigate the safety concerns of the genetic modified fungal insecticides in hope that it will increase the feasibility of wide spread use of these enhanced bioinsecticides.Here we show a short overview: The infection process of M. anisopliae is similar to other entomopathogenic fungi, i.e.This sets the mass production of KillerRed proteins to the hemolymph infection phase of M. anisopliae\u0092s infection cycle.Gisbert Zimmermann (2007): Review on safety of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae , Biocontrol Science and Technology, 17:9, 879-920.During M. anisopliae\u0092s stay within the hemocoel and other interior organs of the insect, KillerRed molecules will remain inert due to the lack of yellow light.The killswitch circuit contains the hemolymph-induced promoter, PMcl, followed by the KillerRed gene and a fungal terminator, TtrpC.This put fungal cells in direct contact with sunlight, allowing KillerRed to create reactive oxygen species like O2?-, which will disrupt the metabolic functions of the cells and eventually killing the fungi.This promoter controls the production of Metarhizium-collagen-like-proteins in wildtype Metarhizium anisopliae, the transcripts of the Mcl1 gene could be detected within 20 minutes of the fungus contacting the hemolymph, but could not be detected when the fungus is cultured in any other medium.However, chromatin is also a ROS-sensitive intracellular localization.So we designed to fuse a SV40 nuclear localization signal to KillerRed protein in order to increase efficiency of KillerRed-mediated oxidative stress.We designed our circuit to utilize the gene expression change of M. anisopliae to activate the production phase of our killswitch.When M. anisopliae depletes the nutrients in host s body, the fungus will emerge from the carcass of its host for conidiation.The increase concentrations of ROS in the cytoplasm disrupt normal cellular functions and impede fungal growth and, in the best case scenario, induce programed necrosis[5].KillerRed effectively killed bacterial cells when exposed to white light for several minutes.Structural Basis for Phototoxicity of the Genetically Encoded Photosensitizer KillerRed.In conclusion, our In-Out-Suicide system allows for more lethal genetically modified fungal pesticides to be developed because it provides them with a ability to clean up after itself, lowering their threat to the surrounding environment.the infection pathway consists on the following steps: (1) attachment of the spore to the cuticle, (2) germination and formation of appressoria, (3) penetration through the cuticle, (4) overcoming of the host response and immune defence reactions of the host, (5) spreading within the host by formation of hyphal bodies or blastospores, i.e.The following two ways have been found to be effective for killing the eukaryotic cells using KillerRed: (1) via an apoptotic pathway using KillerRed to target mitochondria, and (2) via membrane lipid oxidation using membrane-localized KillerRed.Proceedings

flavoprotein, then to a closely coupled Fe4S4 siroheme center in the hemoprotein, and finally from siroheme to sulphiteThe SiR-FP and SiR-HP components of SiR are encoded by cysJ and cysl, respectively.Thus, if an efficient and cost effective design of this NRFA driven pollution crusader device is realized, it would bring about a remarkable change in the automobile and diesel engine industry, and increase the efficiency of these devices, while reducing both the cost, and carbon footprints on the environment.We were able to materialize our dream of designing the perfect \"Pollution Crusader\" prototype model, using the genetically engineered Eco.coli bacteria, to a very good extent, if not fully.From the viewpoint of Synthetic Biology, we succeeded in obtaining the desired clones.The reduction of nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen requires two protons and two electrons, according to the equationN2O + 2H+ + 2e? ? N2 + H2O, E\u00b0? (pH 7.0) = 1.35 V; ?G0? = ?339.5 kJ/mol This is a challenging reaction to be catalyzed by a metalloenzyme, as nitrous oxide is not just kinetically inert to decomposition but also a poor transition metal ligand, due to its weak ?-donating and ?-accepting properties.Although, there have been some reports of other enzymes, such as nitrogenase and a multicopper oxidase from Pyrobaculum aerophilum, able to catalyze this reaction in vitro, the only one, whose primary role is the reduction of nitrous oxide, is N2O reductase (NosZ) The general cloning strategy for P+RBS+NosZ+SYFP consists of the following steps.1.The biobrick BBa_K1866001 (NosZ+SYFP) was prepared by Team IIT Delhi iGEM 2015.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BB_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.These genes are contiguous and together with cysH, the gene for 3 -phosphoadenosine 5 -phosphosulfate sulfotransferase, comprise an operon with the gene order promoter-cysJ-cysI-cysHcysJIH operon is part of the positively regulated cysteine regulon (15) and requires sulfur limitationSiR activity is also dependent on cysG, which encodes a uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase necessary for the synthesis of siroheme This gene is located more than 10 min away from cysJIH on the chromosomal map (34) and is not tightly regulated as part of the cysteine regulatory 1.To characterise the Promoter + RBS + nrfA biobrick (Bba_K1866000), we first ran the total protein content of our recombinant E.coli DH5? culture (into which our pSB1A3 plasmid containing the biobrick had been cloned) on an SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel.The stereochemistry of heme attachment is the same in all known examples of heme c, and the vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are attached to the N- and C-terminal Cys of the CXXCH motif, respectively.Other, less common, derivatives of heme include heme d1, present in cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase, heme a, found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the related heme o, found in some bacterial oxidases.From a chemical perspective, hemes b and c are very similar to each other and thus are not expected to display significant inherent differences in electronic structure or reduction potential.In a nutshell, our prototype model is capable of removing the harmful soot particles, gases like NOx and SOx and also the particulate matter present in the exhaust gases of the various engines being used.This was a remarkable discovery as the NRFA bacteria we are working with, effectively reduce NO into harmless forms, and hence we needed NO as the output from this tank.This will also further reduce environmental repercussions as soot now is converted into a useful product, rather than being dumped into the environment To work on developing and optimizing the desooter tank design to reduce power consumption in the blower, as well as the heat exchanger.After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and the pH of the solution was taken for all different concentrations of Nitrite.One of the pathways to its destruction is reduction to molecular nitrogen by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase found in denitrifying bacteria.NosZ, a gene coding for nitrous oxide reductase, isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, is known to convert N2O to harmless Nitrogen gas (N2).After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and nessler\u0092s reagent was added to a 1ml aliquot.These OD values were plotted against DH5? culture, used as control for the experiments.a.Monitoring with time- For a concentration of 1mM Nitrite, multiple cultures were inoculated.The NrfA nitrite reductase is a membrane-associated respiratory enzyme that couples to the membrane-associated formate-oxidizing enzymes via quinones in order to generate membrane potential.The desooter tank has the following main design components: The exhaust gases enter the desooter tank at high temperature(200-250 C), and hence they cause the water in the tank to evaporate when they pass through it.Thus, the tank containing this solvent dissolves soot and NOx, Sox gases move out with the exhaust.The reason for this repression at high nitrite concentrations is the presence of two regulators of the nrfA gene, NarL and NarP, in the E.coli K-12 genome (from where this gene has been isolated).The OD values were more than that of DH5? cultures throughout, pointing to the fact that more ammonia was being formed in our clone cultures.b.Monitoring with different nitrite concentrations- 50 ml Cultures were inoculated with different concentrations of Sodium nitrite.Finally, we came to the conclusion that while expressing NrfA in a constitutive fashion, there was increased conversion of NOx to ammonia.The NirB nitrite reductase is a soluble siroheme-containing enzyme that uses NADH as an electron donor to reduce nitrite in the cytoplasm.Also, another important product of the reaction, NAD(P)+ act as reducing equivalents that are an inherent part of the electron transport system in the host.The nrfA gene is suppressed at higher levels of nitrite or nitrate.Under the constraints of time, we managed to compile the literature, designed the perfect strategy and using Copasi (modelling tool), we found some novel pathways to regulate and manipulate the increase in Heme production and hence the activity of the Heme proteins.It has two copper centers, a binuclear CuA center, similar to the one found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the CuZ center, a unique tetranuclear copper center now known to possess either one or two sulfide bridges[3].(P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.6.The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, whose atmospheric concentration has been increasing since the introduction of the Haber Bosch process led to the widespread use of nitrogenous fertilizers.The remaining exhaust, congaing NOx, Sox and some amount of water vapor now passes over the silica gel tank at the outlet of this desooter tank.SC-R\u0092s are not efficient enough, and thus, do not lead to a significant increase in the trade-off temperature.Nitric oxide (NO) is a proposed intermediate in the six-electron reduction of nitrite and NrfA can use exogenous NO as a substrate.It\u0092s a cross flow type heat exchanger, with which we did some slight innovations to increase the efficiency of the condensation process.Being an acid, it reduces the PH of the medium and hence decreases the solubility of acidic NOx and SOx, from the exhaust into this solvent.From a biosynthetic perspective, however, these types of heme are quite different; because heme c is synthesized from heme b, the use of heme c requires a greater investment from the organism.However, the overall reaction is given by:Thus, the six electron reduction of NO2- to NH3 is catalysed by the nitrite reductase nrfA.NOx sensors placed at the edge of the silica gel tube confirmed that the gel was catalysing the reaction that we intended to do, converting NO2 to NO.To optimize the design of the desooter tank and the entire contraption, to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the process.We tested the model against the exhaust emitted by a diesel engine.But the end product heme acts as a feedback regulator of ALA synthase thereby inhibiting its production.Incomplete heme incorporation into recombinant protein has been a frequently encountered problem .A population of protein will fold without heme cofactor under condition where folding outspaces heme delivery Natural modi?cations to heme occur after the ferrous iron (Fe2) is inserted into the porphyrin by ferrochelatase, the last enzyme in heme biosynthesisCCm complex : It is a complex of Transmembrane protein which helps in Heme maturation .From modelling we believe that by upregulating CCm complex of proteins we can increase heme incorporation into our proteins.We also saw that at concentrations of Nitrite greater than 2mM, the pH showed a sharp decline.Hence, a level meter is required to keep a check on the water level left in the tank, and hence supply fresh water accordingly through the fresh water inlet.While no intermediates of the reaction are released, NrfA is also able to reduce various oxides other than NO such as, hydroxylamine (H2NOH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), but notably also sulfite(SO32-), providing the only known direct link between the nitrogen and sulfur cycles.While scavenging the research papers, we found out that nobody, till date had found a perfect solution for the over expression of Heme protein.In the past, motor vehicle exhaust was an important, but not the main, source of sulfur dioxide in air.This experiment was also successful, with OD values showing a trend similar to the one above.1.The biobrick BBa_K1153001 (NrfA), previously submitted by KENT iGEM 2013 team, was obtained from iGEM repository.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BBa_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.The digestion products were resolved on an Agarose Gel by Electrophoresis and the size of the fragment confirmed the correct clone.The biggest problem which we encountered was that the heme synthesis was much less as compared to our overexpressed protein.The experiment showed results as expected, with the pH of our clones being higher than the control, which can be attributed to the presence of excess ammonia in the solution.For this, we attach a heat exchanger at the outlet of the tank.Escherichia coli possesses two biochemically distinct nitrite reductase enzymes encoded by the nrfABCDEFG and nirBDC operons.We did manage to extensively characterize the NrfA cloned gene, which served as the nitrate reductase.Nitrite, the substrate for the two enzymes, must either be encountered environmentally or generated by the cell from nitrate reduction by one of the three E. coli nitrate reductases.The initial plan was to clone this gene downstream of the CysI gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which codes for sulfite reductase, catalysing the conversion of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide (H2S).So we decided to eliminate soot and NOx as the primary objective.Research was done extensively and the following genes were found to be best fitting for our project-Since Nitric oxide NO is a major greenhouse gas, the reduction of NO from the air is an important task to address global warming concerns.To get rid of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, we decided to use a solution of acetic acid in water as the solvent.This could be due to the fact that high concentrations of nitrite (NO\u00ac2-) become toxic for the cells, due to which cell death occurs.The exhaust out of this tank is now passed into the desooter tank.Thus, the NO rich gas from this tank is passed into the next tank containing NRFA bacteria for further action.This was required so that these excess water vapor do not clog the silica gel at the outlet of the tank.After 16 hours of growth, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD Values were taken.However, we later realised that the pellet was not of our cells, but of ampicillin, which had formed some sort of white precipitate with the media.Conventionally, diesel engines are operated at temperature ranges which are not very high, as operation at high temperature leads to higher amount of NOx in the exhaust.This enzyme is a periplasmic protein and therefore contains a signal sequence to redirect it to the periplasmic space after the protein is formed.The result showed over expression in the range of 55 kDa, which is roughly equal to the size of our protein.2.Periplasmic protein SDS-PAGE\u0097following the over expression obtained from the Poly Acrylamide gel electrophoresis, we extracted the protein content from the periplasmic space using the periplasm fractionation protocol.While working in the project, towards the end, the main complexity we faced was of Heme protein.This culture was then centrifuged at maximum speed (13,400 rpm) for 10 minutes, and the media was decanted and dried out, leaving only the red ammonia pellet.154:349\u0096354 9.Optimization of the heme biosynthesis pathway for the production of 5-aminolevulinic acid in Escherichia coli, Junli Zhang Zhen Kang Jian Chen Guocheng Du 10.The Chemistry and Biochemistry of Heme c: Functional Bases for Covalent Attachment, Sarah E. J.At high nitrite concentrations, the pellet size reduced drastically (the reason being toxicity at high nitrite concentration).1.Clarke, TA., Mills, PC.We observed considerable reduction in the amount of NOx and SOx reduced.We further instigated the problem and found that one of the largest contributions to rising pollution in Delhi is the exhaust from automobiles and other devices using petrol and diesel as fuel.Use the soot (obtained as dissolved in water) to make ink to ultimately make the process self-sustainable and bring down the processing cost to negligible amounts by accounting for commercial selling of this ink obtained.Spargers are needed to form bubbles of exhaust gas in the mixture.The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur.The pathway of the nrfA Gene is still not completely understood or characterised.(P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.6.The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.We performed a double digestion by EcoRI and PstI to release the cloned fragment from the recombinant vector.These ball bearings, through conduction, cool down to acquire the temperature(similar to) of the flow pipes and hence increase the surface area available to the vapor for condensation, speeding up the condensation process.After regular intervals of time, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD540 values were noted.This was run on another polyacrylamide gel, and we saw over expression on this gel as well, on the appropriate range.3.Minimal media growth- Following a research paper by Clarke et al., a culture of our cloned E.coli DH5? culture was grown on a minimal media containing 5% Luria Broth (by volume), 40mM Potassium Nitrate, 20mM Fumarate and 0.4% glycerol for 16 hours, in anaerobic conditions.U.S. EPA then includes these sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) and targets them for federal clean-up activities.We have been successful in cloning a total of 5 relevant bio bricks:We have submitted these parts in the iGEM registry for future use by any iGEM team.U.S. EPA has found hydrogen sulfide in at least 35 of the 1,689 current or former NPL sites.Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) prosthetic groups perform a wide range of functions in nature includingHeme c: heme c has two covalent thioether bonds formed between Cys side chains and the heme vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 .Delhi has been ranked the first most polluted metropolis in the world, and is one of the most heavily polluted cities in India.In the mechanical half of the project, we designed a prototype which in effect served as the perfect \u0093Pollution Crusader\u0094.Blowers are also attached to the system to compensate for the back pressure generated in the system at each step.Cold water flows through the exchanger pipes and steam flows on the outside.In the period between 2000-2011, PM10 levels in Delhi s air jumped by as much as 47 per cent.While either NarL or NarP was able to induce nrfA-lacZ expression in response to low levels of nitrate, only NarL could repress at high nitrate levels.This problem could therefore, be solved, by expressing the nitrite reductase gene under a constitutive strong promoter, which is what we have done.The prototype model designed will not only serve as an alternative for the existing technology, but has the potential to bring revolutionary changes in the upcoming days.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the nation.We here filled the outside of the pipe portion of the exchanger with metal ball bearings.", "design": "", "human_practice": "iGEM team IIT Delhi put up a stall in this event with the goal to motivate and

Synthase) is the committed step of the heme synthesis pathway, and is usually rate-limiting for the overall pathway.As heme synthesis was our fundamental problem, we put on a lot of efforts in modelling it properly.However, the pathway of Heme biosynthesis is extremely complicated.Hence, the following equation governs the production of ALA:The rest of the reactions in this pathway are assumed to proceed via Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics: After putting in the rate laws and the values of various parameters in Copasi software, following graphs were obtained for the concentrations and rate of formation of various species involved (Copasi has been used for obtaining all graphs and mathematical equations):The following are the differential equations associated with the above

Protein System into use on PETase, but, on the basis of the character of PETase degradation, our project has been extended.We have improved the function and characterization of two previously existing BioBrick Part which are created by our own team in a previous year of iGEM(BBa_K1582000&BBa_K1582001).Our particular desigin is shown as follows.Hydrophobin is a small molecular weight protein produced by filamentous fungi, which is characterized by the ability to form a layer of amphiphilic protein membrane at the interface in order to reverse the nature of the interface covered.Utilized amphiphilic and high temperature, acid and alkali resistance characteristics of hydrophobic protein, co-display the PETase and hydrophobic protein on the surface of eukaryotic cells helps in greatly improving the enzyme activity and broaden the reaction conditions of the enzyme.Surface display can improve the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and avoid the trouble of protein purification.This year, we focus on solving the white pollution problem.Due to its amphiphilic nature, the hydrophobic protein binds to the surface of yeast cells spontaneously and binds the hydrophobic surface toward the extracellular side, which adsorbs the PET film through the hydrophobic interaction force.The yeast cell wall is hydrophilic while the hydrophobic protein is hydrophobic.Besides, we used the hydrophobic protein to modify the surface of reaction system to increase its activity.Hydrophobin amphipathicity refers to the hydrophobic nature that the hydrophilic end of a hydrophobin.Frist and the foremost, researchers should analyze the three-dimensional enzyme structure and understand its characteristic for well-directed proceeding to the next section.After that, the system was separated into two parts to improve its activity.The next step has two paths, one is directed mutation, which site is chosen by analyzing the three-dimensional protein structure to find its functional domains, and the other is surface display.According to its self-characteristic, people will do targeted modify on the enzyme in order to an extensive application.We understood more deeply the problem we were facing to solve and how to put the thoughts into reality to solve the white pollution.This time, we put forward a new system about enzymology called Training Protein.", "human_practice": "During the May, we have invite five professors to our forums to discuss with us about our project ideas.Fortunately, a few companies committed to the value of our project and wanted to support us.These events change our way of thinking, and help us have more comprehensive conclusion.Not only do we focus on the future education, but also chasing for a better achievement of our project.And according to our accomplishment with Training Protein System, the value of modified PETase canbe explored more.The talking gives us confident about our project.The best situation is the used microbe can be treated with sterilization reagent, and the soil has already have fungi, it will not be affected.The discussion let us realized that our PETase is vital for environment protection, but its not enough.Then, Tianjin Naipu Technology Co., Ltd suggested that they can provide us some PET samples and we can also go to their factory for a visit.When talking about our project, the manager said that the PETase is one of the best ways of PET degradation.He advised us to sum up the main steps of our experiment and put it into reality.Having listened to the opinions of the experts, we can better our project.And the one who affect us most is Professor Yang from Tianjin University, who is one of the leading experts in structure biology in China.Finally we use the bottles into our experiment as a connection of the lab and the reality.To expand the thought of our project, we go talk with professors and went for visit.Before we leaving, manager gave us some PET samples (plastic films and bottles) as a present.All the professors are have a large stock of knowledge and gave us many useful advises.To test and verify the new system, we put it in use of PETase and finally confirm that the

up into a theory.The manager show us around and introduce the situation about the production, yield, the development of PET industry and so on.After a negotiations, opposite side promised us that we can go to their factory for a visit.After understand our main idea about PETase, the staff said, if our biological method is available, land using efficiency will be greatly accelerated.Additionally, we also harvest a lot of experience and deepen our understanding of our project when going out of school and contacting with workers and experts.During the event of looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained some sponsor fee from the society but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology.During the times, we are inspirited and come up with better ideas and results.In addition, some experts in companies talked with us very friendly and put forward useful suggestions for us although they did not provide financial support.It s believed that collecting the opinions and suggestions

the assumptions as the reverse reaction rate is zero, so the constant valve of k6 is zero and the equation-14 can change into:The above differential equation is the final rate equation of the whole reaction process, and from the equation-15 we can see that the reaction rate is a constant, D. And the reaction rate constants were different at different PET concentrations and different PET films.As can be seen from the above reaction kinetics model, the whole reaction rate is a constant after reaching the adsorption equilibrium.Third, the effect of reaction area in the hydrolysis process can be well considered by taking the adsorption process into account.In this part, we choose the Langmuir isothermal adsorption equation to describe the first step in the reaction process, the combination of the PET film and the PET enzyme.We needn\u0092t to take the reaction rate of the first reaction equation into account because it has been calculated in the adsorption part and the differential equation of the remaining two reaction rate as follows:so the following equation can be gotten by putting the relationship equation of the concentration of PET\u0095S and the PET film\u0092s area into the above differential equation:And combine the above equation and the equation of dimensionless Langmuir adsorption equation, we can get: Now, let\u0092s analyze the parameters of the above equation.There are three reasons we choose two steps, adsorption and reaction, to describe the process of PET enzymatic hydrolysis reaction: First, the adsorption process has a greater impact on the PET enzymatic hydrolysis process which we can\u0092t ignore.The general adsorption image of this equation in a typical solution is shown in picture 1:Here we assume that the PET enzyme adsorption process in accordance with the adsorption process in the picture above.It\u0092s used in this situation as well, so the double reciprocal equation is:So if we have the experimental data by experimenting with quartz crystal microbalance to detect the adsorption capacity of PET, we can get the constant ?max and Ka through the equation above.b. Schematic diagram of the combination of the PET enzyme and reaction products while the hydrolysis reaction is happening.When the enzyme adsorbed on the PET film is released after the reaction, a new PET enzyme will be adsorbed on the PET immediately from the picture 2, so the adsorption equilibrium is not broken.At last, the third step is the hydrolysis reaction and the three-step reaction equations as follows:In the above equation, the meaning of each symbol represents as follows: PET\u0095S: The middle state of PET enzyme adsorption on the surface of PET sheet.In order to apply this equation to solve the reaction kinetics problem well, some assumptions are given follows: B.The adsorption of PET enzyme on the PET-solid-surface is monomolecular layer.While, in fact, the product of the hydrolysis reaction, BHET and MHET shown a competitive inhibition of the hydrolytic activity of PET enzyme against PET sheet, which would decrease the free concentration of free enzyme in the solution according to Markus Barth.And through this reaction rate equation we can get different reaction rate in the condition of different PET film and PET enzyme initial PET enzyme concentration.In our case, in order to predict the optimum condition of recombination cell decomposing PET, it was carried out the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis model.In this way, we put the Langmuir adsorption equation linked with the second step of hydrolysis reaction process, here, the equation above is the key to connect the two step, and the valve of the CPET\u0095S will be used in the next part.Because the reaction time relative to the adsorption time is so long that the time to achieve the adsorption equilibrium can be negligible, while, after reaching the maximum adsorption quantity, new PET enzyme will be adsorbed on the PET sheet soon whenever there is some PET enzyme reaction with PET to release the products.It\u0092s obvious that K, k3, Ka are constant in the system, while, in a fixed experiment, the area of the PET sheet and the concentration of the PET enzyme are unchangeable according to hypothesizes above, so the right part of the equation above is a constant, B.There are three main steps in the whole process on the basis of the given assumptions above, the first step is the former part which describes the adsorption process and the second step is the effective combination for enzyme catalytic reaction of the PET film and the PET enzyme on the basis of the physical adsorption.So the valve of the character, B, is not a constant because the valve of the concentration of PET enzyme, Ef, is changeable with the reaction time.D.The adsorption process of PET enzyme on the PET-solid-surface will come a dynamic equilibrium after a certain time.It\u0092s known that the general enzymatic reaction rate is far faster than diffusion rate, so, in this process, the hydrolysis reaction is very important as well as the diffusion adsorption process.As we all know, the symbol C means the concentration of the material, so we can get that CPET\u0095S is the concentration of the adsorption combination state of the PET film and the PET enzyme; CPETS is the concentration of the effective combined of the PET film and the PET enzyme; CS is the concentration of the free PET enzyme in the solution and CDTP is the concentration of the product, dimethyl terephthalate.So we can get:The parameter valves can be given according to the literature and experimental data:So the image of the reaction rate with the time under the condition of the A=28.27mm2, and E0=4\u00d710-3 is shown in the picture 3.Picture 3: The image of the reaction rate with the time.From the picture above, we can get that the reaction rate will decrease with the time because of the reaction products\u0092 prohibition.Here, we use the character PET\u0095S represent the middle state of PET enzyme adsorption on the surface of PET sheet.It avoid the solving process of the ?max needing the adsorption experiment by quartz crystal microbalance which would cost a lot of time.The model of PET enzymatic hydrolysis process is made up of two parts.E. The enzymatic reaction is carried out only on the solid surface of the PET sheet, and the PET enzyme won\u0092t enter the interior of the PET, and the solubility of the PET in the solution is zero.According to Markus Barth, we can know that the products such as: TPA, MHET, EG and BHET have a competence of combining with the PET enzyme, what\u0092s more, MHET and BHET are powerful in this.According to the Langmuir theory, the adsorption isotherm equation is:In the above equation, ? is the quality of PET enzyme adsorption by unit quality PET, g; ?max is the maximum adsorption of PET enzyme by unit quality PET, g; Ka is the adsorption dissociation constant, mL/g; Ef is the concentration of free PET enzyme in the solution, g/mL.In general, we use the double reciprocal method to find the adsorption constant of the Langmuir equation.Figure1 is a surf picture of our model, while Figure2 is a slice picture for our convenience in observing the details.Figure4: 4-D surf picture of Relative Enzyme ActivityFigure 5: 4-D slice picture of Relative Enzyme ActivityWe established the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis model established based on experimental data and find the mathematical expression of the efficiency of recombination cell decomposing PET.But the reaction rate shouldn\u0092t be a constant according to our experimental results in the whole process which indicates that the reaction products has a certain effect on the process.While it\u0092s no time for us to do so many adsorption process experiments, so it\u0092s the other way we need to seek in order to solve the reaction kinetics problem well.While the combination of the PET enzyme and the products reduces the PET enzyme concentration in solution which moves the adsorption equilibrium to deduce the maximum adsorption capacity and equilibrium adsorption capacity.This isothermal adsorption equation is suitable for the case where there is only one adsorbed species, while the PET adsorption process is just this one.So the concentration of this PET\u0095S can be achieved through the following equation:While in the above equation, K is a constant connecting the three characters and A represents the area of the PET film.And as we always know, the maximum adsorption capacity is certainly proportional to the area of the PET film, so the concentration of the combination state of the PET enzyme and PET film in the whole system is related to the PET film area and dimensionless adsorption capacity.D. The time to achieve the equilibrium of the adsorption reaction can be ignored.In this model, only the PET enzyme binds to the PET sheet and the PET is insoluble in the solution.DTP: The main product of PET hydrolysis, dimethyl terephthalate.According to combining the Langmuir equation and the reaction rate equation we get a heterogeneous kinetic model.The illustration is shown below by picture-2:Picture 2:a.The state of the adsorption without hydrolysis reaction happened.So the valve of the constant ?max and Ka is not wanted if we can get the reaction kinetics equation finally through another way.We set three variables as the reaction conditions in our model, which are the time(x1) and temperature(x2) of protein-induced expression and the cell concentration(x3).k1-6: The reaction constant of each reaction equation.So the kinetic equation eventually needs to be corrected which we will cover in the next section.In this part, our goal is to deduce the chemical reaction rate.So the Langmuir adsorption equation can be converted into the next form:The maximum adsorption capacity of the solution will be avoided by using this model.C.No intermolecular forces between the PET enzyme molecules.Here we only consider the main obstacles, BHET and MHET, even though we ignore these by-products because they are so few, but their influence on the adsorption can\u0092t be excluded.We can get that when it\u0092s 18 hours later, the reaction rate is zero which is in accordance with the experimental results that when we extend the reaction time the products won\u0092t increase.Effect of hydrolysis products on the enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate nanoparticles by a polyester hydrolase from Thermobifida fusca.The change of the area of the PET sheet is assumed to be negligible due to the slow rate of PET decomposition.Turbidimetric analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate nanoparticles.PETS: The binding state of PET in the PET enzyme active site.We made a 4-dimension picture to show the relationship between the selected three conditions and the PET decomposition efficiency using our fitting model.The experimental data of one experiment group we used is shown in table2.Table 2: Relative Enzyme Activity of E-coli with INP(ice nucleation protein)The results of our model are as follows.The reverse reaction rate is assumed to be zero as the quality of cis-reaction products is negligible compared to the amount of solution due to the slow cis-reaction rate.We consider that the reaction efficiency correlates with the protein-induced expression time logarithmically, and correlates with the temperature of protein-induced reaction and cell concentration quadratically.", "notebook": "Cultivation of PETase in

so that it can break down methane by cloning and expressing the sMMO of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath).The sMMO operon of M. capsulatus (Bath), figure 1, has ten known protein encoding genes, summarized in Table 1.Our team wants to engineer E. coli in order for it to break down methanol to biomass by cloning and expressing the genes methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) Hps and Phi are both part of the fixation phase of the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway and convert formaldehyde to hexolose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate respectively .Since methanol, the breakdown product of methane, is poisonous, we will also implement the Ribulose-Monophosphate (RuMP)- pathway from Bacillus methanolicus to convert methanol to biomass in three steps.Since we want to clone the genes that form the enzyme complex sMMO and use them to construct our own sMMO operon for expression in E. coli, the genes mmoQ, mmoS, and mmoR are not relevant and thus excluded from our project.Figure 1: sMMO operon of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath)adapted from Scarlan et.Characterization of MMOD, a long overlooked component of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).cloned the sMMO genes of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath) for the purpose of expressing them in Escherichia coli (E. coli).The two iron ions, the electrons (which change the iron ions), and the oxygen together with methane in the center of MMOH (bound to MMOB) make the magic happen to break one C-H bond in methane to a C-OH.To date there are two enzyme complexes known that can do the task of breaking methane; soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO), and the membrane bound particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO)1\u00963.15, 205\u009656 (2015).Cs\u00e1ki, R., Bodrossy, L., Klem, J., Murrell, J.

Involvement of MmoR and MmoG in the transcriptional activation of soluble methane monooxygenase genes in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b.It is in this diiron center of MMOH where the actual conversion of methane to methanol takes place.At low copper levels however, sMMO is expressed which uses iron-ions in the enzyme core for breaking methane.2\u00964 The methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (M. capsulatus (Bath)) is one of the most studied methanotrophs that has both pMMO and sMMO.Both enzymes break methane with the following reaction: Other than that they both can convert methane to methanol and require oxygen for the process, are they structurally very different.MMOG is thought to be a chaperone which will properly fold the sMMO proteins.More technical information about the specific functions of each sMMO subproteins after the summary.sMMO is build out of 5 proteins, whereof MMOX, MMOY, MMOZ form one protein complex called MMOH.MMOH, the hydroxylase, consist of three subunits ? (60.6 kDa), ? (45.1 kDa), and ? (19.8kDa), encoded by mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ2.Nerveless the different variance found within the other two phases of the RuMP cycle can all be expressed in E.coli too.The surrounding air will be pumped through the filter so the methane gas can be taken up by E. coli and be converted to biomass.All enzymes needed for the serine cycle, except three are present in E. coli.pMMO is expressed at high copper levels, which makes sense as it uses copper in the core of the enzyme to break the strong C-H bond in methane.Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and is leaked into the atmosphere at different natural and industrial places.Afterward helps MMOC to release methanol and resets MMOH by providing new electrons1,3.Figure 2: Overview of the sMMO protein with subunits ?,?, and ? of MMOH, and MMOB, MMOD, and MMOR.There is not much known about the function of the 12 kDa protein MMOD, formerly known as orfY.al 2009Six of the other seven genes, mmoX, mmoY, mmoZ, mmoB, mmoC, and, mmoD, encode the proteins of the sMMO complex.One aspect is that serine does not utilize formaldehyde directly, but it is added into the cycle in order to form serine.Determination by X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Fe-Fe separation in the oxidized form of the hydroxylase of methane monooxygenase alone and in the presence of MMOD.Compared to the serine cycle the RuMP cycle only needs two additional genes added to E.coli compared to the serine cycle that needs three.Even better, the enzyme  that these methanotrophs use can breakdown methane at ambient temperatures and pressure.6-9Thus if we could understand and use this enzyme it would be possible to develop tools to minimize the methane leakage at many places like barns and gas hydrates.Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde in all aerobic methylotrophes by the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase (Medh).Previous studies have shown that the most relevant pathway for this project are the RuMP pathway and the serine cycle.Methanol is an one carbon structure that is toxic to the cell.MMOD, encoded by mmoD, is thought to inhibit the process by blocking the binding of either MMOB or MMOC to MMOH.The last gene, mmoG, encodes for the protein MMOG, is not previously been uses in a iGEM project.In this step three enzymes have to be added in E. coli in order to go from methanol to fructose-6-phosphate; methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi).In another iron monooxygenase, Bacterial binuclear iron monooxygenases, a similar protein as MMOG called mimG was needed for proper folding of one of the other monooxygenase proteins6.Further studies are needed to resolve the functionality of MMOD both in vitro and in vivo.The mmoG gene is suggested to encode a GroEL-like chaperone that contributes to the correct folding of the other sMMO proteins5,6, but this is so far not proven.The first group showing that MMOD is expressed in M. capsulatus (Bath), also has evidence that MMOD can bind to the hydroxylase MMOH7.A big part of the industrial methane emission is in the agricultural sector in places like Gas hydrates are trapped ice-like crystals of gas that are only stable in a specific temperature and pressure range.& Sugimoto, S. Bacillus subtilis yckG and yckF Encode Two Key Enzymes of the Ribulose Monophosphate Pathway Used by Methylotrophs, and yckH Is Required for Their Expression.In addition will we clone the mmoG gene of the sMMO operon which is thought to encode a chaperone (MMOG) involved in folding of the other MMO proteins5,6.Nature 523, 534\u00965 (2015).Liikanen, A., Silvennoinen, H. & Karvo, A. Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in two coastal wetlands in the northeastern Gulf of Bothnia, Baltic Sea.* Formaldehyde to hexulose-6-phosphate with the enzyme 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (hxlA)* Hexulose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate with the enzyme 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (hxlB)  A closed container to restrict the genetically modified E. coli.A third gene, mmoR, encoding the protein  MMOR , is a transcriptional activator of the whole sMMO operon3\u00965.Two genes, mmoQ, and, mmoS, coding for the proteins MMOQ and MMOS can sense copper and play a role in regulating transcription of the sMMO operon3\u00965.Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) are the two enzymes involved in the fixation phase.They did show that MMOG (and  MMOR ) are required for protein binding to the promoter region of the sMMO operon in the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b5.However, the oxidation can occur in two different pathways.Biochemistry 54, 2283\u009694 (2015).Sazinsky, M. H. & Lippard, S. J. Methane monooxygenase: functionalizing methane at iron and copper.Medh2 was therefore found to be the best candidate of the three to use in this project2.Or even better, one could convert methane to methanol or biomass so it can be more easily transported and used as a bio-fuel instead of being discarded.Hps and Phi are found in most methylotrophes, but different methylotrophes have different genes involved in the cleavage and rearrangement phase.So that the PPQ biosynthetic pathway has to be cloned into E.coli or PPQ has to be added to the growth medium.The other pathway to consider is the serine pathway.It seems that MMOD binds to MMOH in competition with the regulatory protein MMOB, which hints to an inhibitory function of MMOD7.Examples of non-orthologs pathway are ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, the tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathway, and the gluthione-linked pathway.That is why we want to implement MMO into Escherichia coli (E. coli) so that it can breakdown methane.Sazinsky, M. H. & Lippard, S. J. Methane monooxygenase: functionalizing methane at iron and copper.These bound subunits form again a dimer, resulting in ?2?2?2, with in the middle a  canyon .On each of the ??? subunits is a binding site for either MMOB, the regulator, or MMOC, the reductase2.Binding of MMOB to MMOH is needed for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation (the actual breaking of the C-H to C-OH bonding)2.The group of microorganism that has the ability to grow with only a one carbon compounds as the single carbon source are called methylotrophes1.MMOC transfers the two electrons from NADH to the diiron site in MMOH2.The goal of this final step is to break down methanol to biomass, so E. coli can utilize methanol as an energy source.Preparation and X-ray structures of metal-free, dicobalt and dimanganese forms of soluble methane monooxygenase hydroxylase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).The NAD-linked cytoplasmic enzyme was therefor chosen because only one additional gene is needed and it utilizes the electron acceptor already found in E. coli.However, there is no known activation enzyme or sufficient flux for the process of condensation of formaldehyde2.What this means is that only two additional genes, Hps and Phi, have to be added to E.coli in order for RuMP cycle to perform its function.PLoS One 8, e59188 (2013).Ochsner, A. M., M\u00fcller, J. E. N., Mora, C. A.They also showed a possible involvement of MMOD in the assembly of the metal center in MMOH7\u00969.All three Medhs have been tested under different conditions and it was found that Medh2 showed similar activity in E. coli lysate as B. methanolicus under similar conditions.Hydroxylation means the adding of an -OH group, in this case the change of methane to methanol (CH4 to CH3-OH) which happens inside MMOH.15, 205\u009656 (2015).Zhang, Y., Xin, J., Chen, L. & Xia, C.

facilities, and cattle farms.We have devided our activities under the categories Our project was inspired by the possibility of capturing methane emissions in facilities where methane is produced, and converting this methane into a useful product.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "", "protocol": "The amount of formed NADH can be measured at a wavelength of 340 nm.The formation of NADH is proportional to the amount of methanol converted into formaldehyde.To get a hint about the background in our reaction we established two controls:  E. coli strain expressing MEDH2 but methanol was not added to the assay reaction In a second approach we wanted to determine the in vivo activity of heterologous expressed MEDH2 in E. coli.During the conversion of methanol into formaldehyde NAD+ is used as a cofactor, leading to the formation of NADH.Protein expression under control of a T7 promoter can be induced by adding Isopropyl-?-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG).Figure 1: Schematic overview of the pET28a or pET30a vector with a T7 promoter, a ribosomal binding site (RBS) followed by our gene of interest.With PCR we added restriction enzyme sites at the 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 end of CDS of each gene.The codonoptimized mmoG as well as all three genes encoding the enzymes for the methanol to biomass conversion (medh2, hps, and phi) were created as The CDS of the hps gene, encoding the 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase, contains PstI and XbaI restriction sites making it not compatible with the BioBrick system.The concentration of formaldehyde is proportional to the concentration of DDL, which can be calculated using the Beer\u0096Lambert law.Instead mmoG was synthesized by IDT as a gBlock gene fragment, codon optimized for protein expression in E. coli.The second project part had the intention to create four new basic BioBrick parts.During the conversion of methanol into formaldehyde NADH is generated.The production of NADH can be measured at a wavelength of 340 nm.Figure 1:Schematic overview of in vitro assay of NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase.Thereby the Beer\u0096Lambert law can be used to calculate the concentration of NADH which corresponds to the concentration of produced formaldehyde.Imidazole is an organic compound and replaces the tagged protein in the interaction with the Ni-NTA chelate complex.To characterize the functionality of the NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase (medh2) two different approaches were chosen.Formaldehyde will react with components in the Nash reagent to form 3,5-Diacetyl-1,4-Dihydro-2,6-Lutidine (DDL.In the presence of formaldehyde it leads to the formation of 3,5-Diacetyl-1,4-Dihydro-2,6-Lutidine (DDL).Genes encoding the enzymes for the conversion of methanol into biomass (medh2, hps, and phi) were amplified by PCR from Bacillus methanolicus (MGA3) genomic DNA and TOPO blunt end cloning into the pCR4 vector was performed.By detecting the absorption at 412 nm, the formation of DDL can be measured.In two rounds of in vitro mutagenesis both restriction sites were removed and hps was cloned into pSB1C3 and submitted as a Before assembling the final constructs we wanted to show that each individual protein could be expressed in E. coli.Afterwards the gene was cloned either into pET-30 or pET-28 with the use of the listed restriction enzymes.Furthermore it is necessary to show if the heterologous expressed proteins are soluble expressed and not aggregated into inclusion bodies.Primers were designed in a way that they bind in the 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 untranslated region (UTR) of each gene.TOPO blunt end cloning of mmoG did not succeed.Aggregation in inclusion bodies prevents a proper folding and thereby proper function of the protein.Those basic parts consist of the coding sequences (CDS) of a gene.Addition of imidazol removes the polyhistidine tagged protein from the chelate complexe.For the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) we got the genes for the subunits (mmoXYZBCD) cloned into the BioBrick standard vector pSC1B3 from the Those six parts are registered as BioBrick parts under the names; Bba_K1390001 (mmoB), Bba_K1390002

wanted to show particular protein expression of each subunit into E. coli.We made hps compatible to the BioBrick system removing a XbaI and PstI restriction site by in-vitro mutagenesis and generated a basic BioBrick part (BBa_K1619002) .These BioBricks contain the original genomic sequences of medh2, hps and phi.We expressed MEDH2 in E. coli and purified the enzyme.Figure 5: Sequencing of hps

is powerful or not.We took advantage of the high precision and programmability of light system and the specificity and the convenience from a Cas9-recombinase hybrid.Thus, combined with our light-switch, the user is able to gain better control over the bacteria\u0092s metabolism pathways.With this information storage platform in hand, what can we do in the future?The controlling circuit utilizes 3 AT89S52-24PU DIP-40 SCMs (single chip microcomputer) to execute programmed-controlling of the 24 tri-color LEDs, while the computer interacting port monitors the whole system through given protocol sequences.Green-light system do not represent none of two types of binary information, instead it acts as a license that allows the recombines to work [4].The E-code 1.0 software system aims to provide convenient commanding for users of the E-light hardware system.For the Cas9-recombinsae system we selected recombinase system as the tool to edit the gene due to its specificity for consensus sequences.Adding NOT and OR gates downstream the light system might render the system more complex and therefore available for better information storing capacity.We also would be able to develop better encoding algorithm to integrate more information into the bacterial genome and in a more versatile way.In order to build an information storage platform described above we devised a hardware assisted by a software that can eventually convert any form of profile into biological meaningful information.It is not hard to imagine a world where you can simply store any kind of digital information you want into the bacteria, and break the storing limitation of general electrical device.In order to utilize the light as an input signal, we have to first test its basic parameters which can be refer to.For example, we can denote the blue-light system to control information containing \u00930\u0094 whereas the red-light system to control information containing \u00931\u0094.With more delicate design and further investigation into this system, we can take our platform onto a whole new level.We adapted an engineering strategy onto these two component system by combining different modules and components from different species in order to achieve highest efficiency [2].We additionally built a model of the relationship between the light input and the protein expression output based on previous results.All being said, we still needed to first determine the basic parameter of this inducible system.Again, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out, turning out to be promising to ensure that inducible system can work successfully in E. coli.A straightforward strategy is to use light-switchable two-component system to directly control the gene-editing hybrid.We received quite convincing results to support that light-switchable two-component system can work successfully in E. coli.At present our system can theoretically encode and encrypt any form of file and convert their binary data stream into biological meaningful information, i.e.The light-exposure & bacterial culture system is based on a 24-well plate coupled with tri-color LEDs.We therefore complemented this system by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, because it is guided by a sgRNA pair that is not limited to specific sequences.Given the ideas come up with above, how can we put all parts together in order to store information within the E. coli?Using smaller Cas9 endonuclease is also a must when considering transforming the entire plasmid into the bacteria, which is actually a metabolic burden for the cell.[2] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].", "design": "The green-light system works an extremely similar way to that of the blue light system: it is comprised of two essential components, a light sensor and a response regulator.The red-light system used in our project consists of two components, a membrane-bound light sensor Cph8 and a response regulator OmpR [3].Light-switchable two-component system (TCS) is one example of how light signal can be wired into the metabolic pathway within the bacteria [3].Additionally, there are two components within: a light sensor and a response regulator, the former sensing the incoming light and responding to it by changing the conformation, the latter reacting to the sensor and turning on or off the gene expression due to its transcriptional factor nature.The principle behind light-switchable two-component system goes like this: When a beam of light hits on the bacteria, the effector module in the sensor, i.e., the HK domain, will change its confirmation accordingly, therefore its catalytic activity transits from a phosphokinase to a phosphatase.In this system, a J? chain is introduced to link the light sensor and effector together, of which the conformation change is induced, switching the YF1 (the fusion protein) from a kinase to a phosphatase.The blue-light-sensitive LOV domain in its soluble light sensor YF1 is derived from a protein termed YtvA from B. subtilis, whereas the histidine kinase domain derived from the protein FixL and the response regulator FixJ are found B. japonicum.As a result, a recombinase system is the most ideal candidate when looking for an information storing executor.Thus, the response regulator, FixJ, is dephosphorylated and deprived of the ability to drive FixK2-promotor-regulated gene expression [3].Since that there is an endogenous expression level of red-light system in E. coli, a bacterial knock-out technique is introduce to avoid a potentially confusing result [4].To be more specific, a light sensor is made up of two modules: an actual light sensor and an effector which possesses both kinase and phosphatase activity.As a result, RR cannot recognize its downstream target sequence and cannot activate the expression of the reporter gene.As is indicated by its nomenclature, this system is switchable \u0096 it has two interchangeable states when stimulated by different light conditions.With the advancement of gene editing technology, today CRISPR/Cas9 system has been exploited to carry out a myriad of functions, such as knock-out and knock-down of a certain gene, single molecule imaging, etc.It turns out that the inducible ccdB system works perfectly well, so it is competent to be used to screen the optimal distance between sgRNA pairs and an appropriate linker choice.Cas9, an endonuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes, can target and cleave specific DNA sequences that are next to the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) when provided with a guide RNA.Different light systems generally do not interfere with each other, and therefore can be stimulated and silenced in parallel [2].Here, however, the light sensor module is designated as Cyb, along with its histidine kinase, constituting the light sensor component CcaS.The light sensor is made up of a red-light-sensitive cyanobacterial phytochrome sensor module Phy derived from a protein called Cph1 from S. PCC 6803, and a histidine kinase domain from a protein called EnvZ from E. coli.Generally, two families of recombinase have been identified: the tyrosine recombinase and the serine recombinase [5].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].In this way, precise gene editing and information storing can be achieved by utilizing the light system to regulate the dCas9-recombinase hybrid.In addition, the inducible ccdB system has other potential future applications.That is to say, we still count on the specificity and accuracy of recombinase, but meanwhile we need the assistance from Cas9.We established a model of the inducible ccdB system indicating the relationship between iPTG addition and OD value after discussing parameters of iPTG, ccdB, relative concentration of bacteria, and OD value measured.After successfully constructing all the systems required and confirming its efficacy, we can bridge the light-switchable TCS and the dCas9-recombines system together.CRISPR-Cas9 system is a newly developed gene-editing tool that breaks the limit of specific recognition sites.Consequently it is regarded as a complementary DNA cutter that is not restricted to recognize unique sequences, but is versatile that can recognize any sequence within the genome guided by its sgRNA.This means that if current information storage capacity is not enough, we do not need to search for a new recombinase, instead changing the sgRNA pairs can solve the problem.Engineering Escherichia colito see light[J].Therefore, if we have to choose one form of signal as the input, the optical input is favored [1].A pair of sgRNAs targeting the sense and antisense strand of the DNA sequence guide the fusion protein to the location, and the recombinase part of the fusion protein carries out deletion or inversion of the DNA segment.The blue light system follows similar principles, containing two components as well.Of course, it is easy to understand why we then turn to Cas9 and see if it can overcome the specificity issue from recombinase issue [6].There are two commonly used gene-editing tools: site-specific recombinase and CRISPR-Cas9 system.Following the guidance of sgRNAs, Cas9 endonuclease can be used to modify any site of the genome conveniently.Along ccdB\u0092s sequence we designed 25 and 24 sgRNAs targeting each strand of the DNA.However, accurate deletion or inversion, a vital aspect to consider when devising an information storing platform, are hard to accomplish because of double-strand breaks introduced by Cas9 endonuclease.With this new tool we don\u0092t need to bother considering and introducing recognition sites of the recombinases anymore.Also, without causing double-strand breaks, gene editing can be safer and more accurate [6].In other words, a major drawback of this information-storing platform is that every time a new recombinase has to be used when increasing the storing capability.[1] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].The response regulator is derived from OmpR of which the recognition site is a promoter named OmpC.Site-specific recombinase is an endonuclease that is capable of inserting, deleting and inverting a DNA fragment within the recognition site.In our system, three mainstream light systems we took advantage of all follow this basic scheme.Second, easy access and low cost renders light system frequently used.Effects of different designs of linkers are also tested using this inducible ccdB system.We built an inducible ccdB screening system for it.Refactoring and optimization of light-switchable Escherichia coli two-component systems[J].The sensor and the effector interact closely in order to give a precise light-induced response.Recombinases were previously utilized to accomplish information storage in biological systems due to its specificity [7].Although the screening work wasn\u0092t finished, a linker choice and distance between two sgRNAs worked finely.Three types of TCS are now the most commonly investigated, including red, blue and green light system, named by at which wavelength the system is responsive.Addition of iPTG induces expression of ccdB and then bacteria get killed, but if ccdB gene is successfully disrupted by dCas9 recombinase, then the bacteria survive.[7] Yang L, Nielsen A A K, Fernandez-Rodriguez J, et al.", "human_practice": "In addition to our telling the story of iGEM and some previous interesting projects, we encouraged them to form several temporary teams, which enabled them to exchange their preliminary ideas relevant to feasible iGEM projects.The most impressive part came when the representative of every group shared the amazing thoughts of their discussion, and those brave students were awarded with small souvenirs.The public we targeted to were mainly consisted of three groups listed below: students from other iGEM teams, freshmen from the School of Life Science in Tsinghua this year and some high school students who showed great interest in our project and daily experiment.Freshmen major in Biology always look forward to their research life in the future with enormous passion every year.At last, we received many reflections and encouragements written on the leaflet from them, which made us feel even more hopeful when thinking about

communication between teams was realized while we got helpful advice at the same time.We decided to create a chance for high school students to experience experiments in the lab after we got to know their desire for practical attempt based on theoretical knowledge learned in class.Contacted successfully on May 18th, these senior three students from RDFZ visited the lab on May 24th for the first

GFP, will be expressed when bacteria carrying this plasmid are provided with blue light.Add gradients of 0.1% iPTG to bacteria suspension.In this experiment, we used a recombinase system to insert a Kanamycin gene into the genomic region where we want to target and then utilized other recombinase to remove the Kanamycin gene.For the red light system, we transformed a plasmid containing the entire red light system (Cph8, HO1 and PcyA), along with a promoter, a terminator and an OmpR regulated reporter.Therefore, when bacteria carrying this gene are provided with the red light, the reporter cannot be synthesized.The result supported this prediction because we can observe a distinctive expression pattern between the treated (provided with red light) and untreated (kept in dark) group.Eventually, we successfully fused two proteins with the seamless cloning, as is supported by the appearance of 4-5kb bands in nearly all lanes.In addition, we added a roughly 36bp linker between the two in order to increase its flexibility.As can be seen in Figure 3, roughly 1kb bands appear nearly in every lane, supporting that our knock-out system was effective.In this experiment, we planned to fuse two proteins, a recombinase and a Cas9, together.(c) Measure OD600 value of each dilution of the suspension, using liquid LB as blank.", "safety": "Before we started our project, all of our team members had received lab safety training, including standard experimental protocols, disposal of waste, information on hazardous chemicals and proper use of biosafety cabinets etc.The risks to team members were minimized by wearing appropriate PPEs in the lab all the time and following lab safety regulations of Tsinghua University.In order to avoid that problem, all members in the team were instructed of how to distribute and utilize this gene with specific orientation.Since that ccdB is an inhibitor of DNA gyrase and therefore interferes with normal bacterial activity, any improper disposal of ccdB protein and plasmids containing ccdB gene will pose serious results to the natural bacterial communities.In addition, since that ccdB is not harmful for human beings, it is trustworthy and safe to use this protein to kill the bacteria.In one of our experimental design, a lethal protein ccdB was used to screen for successful dCas9-recombinase hybrid design.Therefore, it\u0092s reasonable to conclude that our hardware is harmless.The E. coli we involved in the whole project was lab safe strain DH5?.", "keywords": "chromoprotein encouraged references respiration

2440  Prof. Ohad Medalia, Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich, Switzerland.", "background": "", "description": "bacteria that is able to respire its excess electrons through electrodes),  and since PET is a polymer that contains a large amount of energy in its carbon-carbon bonds,  excess energy released by our engineered P. putida from terephthalate degradation will be harnessed and utilized in a microbial fuel cell (MFC),  leading to an efficient and energy producing, rather than consuming, degradation of PET.In order to achieve symbiosis between our two chosen bacterial species we have separated them using a dialysis membrane so that the E. coli, secreting the LC-Cutinase and utilizing ethylene glycol is enclosed and separated from the P. putida which is utilizing the terephthalic acid that diffuses out of the dialysis bag.Their mutual dependence depends on the fact that terephthalate will be the sole carbon source for P. putida s growth, and cannot be generated in the absence of E. coli secreting LC-cutinase, while E. coli will not survive in elevated levels of terephthalate, that has to be degraded by P. putida, thus engineering a symbiotic dependence between the two bacterial species.Our goal is to genetically engineer P. putida so it will contain two plasmids which will encode for two essential components: a membrane transporter that will carry the terephthalate molecule into the cell and the necessary genes for its degradation.We plan to insert a degradation pathway for terephthalate into P. putida using genetic engineering, while the other monomer of PET, ethylene glycol, is utilized by E. coli that secretes our improved LC-Cutinase protein.The terephthalate degradation pathway, derived from a strain of Commamonas testosteroni , terminates in protocatechuate, a toxic molecule for most bacteria, however, P. putida, is able to utilize it as a carbon source for its growth (Jimenez et al 2002).LC-Cutinase is an enzyme discovered from an unknown organism in leaf-branch compost, and has been found to be one of the most efficient enzymes in breaking down PET polymers with relatively high crystallinity into degradable products, the monomers ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.This way, we hope to achieve a full degradation of the two PET products and with it to drive the PET biocatalysis reaction by LC-Cutinase forward.This energy can be utilized in a future device for the maintenance of growth conditions or the pretreatment of PET to render it easily degraded by the engineered bacteria.We have chosen to work with P. putida, which is a gram-negative bacterium, for its diverse metabolism, including the ability to degrade organic solvents, especially protocatechuate, a toxic substance for most bacteria, its similarity to E. coli in most laboratory protocols and its electrochemical properties which allow it to be used in our fuel cell.Based on the LC-Cutinase structure that was solved in 2014 (Sulaiman et al 2014), we have chosen to use a rational mutagenesis approach for its improvement.We decided to achieve this by genetic engineering of metabolic pathways of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida (P. putida).The ethylene glycol degradation pathway, present in our chosen E. coli strain, BL-21, supplies a carbon source for its growth while degrading PET to its respective monomers with LC-Cutinase.The two bacteria will metabolize the two PET degradation products - leading to the conversion of PET to CO2.In addition, current solutions for the disposal of PET, such as recycling and burying are also energy consuming as they require means such as transportation,  sorting and initial processing.Many ideas were considered in dealing with plastic waste such as burning plastic or burying it, but these solutions are considered damaging to the environment due to plastics toxicity.In addition, the pelB leader sequence was fused to the enzyme in its N terminus and was expressed and secreted to the growth media of E. coli.Next, we wanted to fully degrade the resulting monomers to CO2, this way no toxic molecules will remain as products of the degradation process.With the advancements made in the field of polymer chemistry during the 20th century,  many new polymers were introduced into industry and are known to us today as Polystyrene, Polyethylene and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET).Since the introduction of plastics, some microbial communities or species have evolved to successfully degrade plastics, however,  from an evolutionary point of view, probably due to the relatively short period of exposure to plastics,  they are yet to be efficient in plastic biodegradation.However, one of its best features was found to be one of its greatest drawbacks, the durability of plastic makes it virtually non-degradable.Using this approach, we made various mutations using an algorithm developed by Dr. Sarel Fleishman of the Weizmann Institute of Science (Goldenzweig et al.In order to offer a better alternative to the existing solutions we decided to explore options which would allow us to maintain a positive energy balance.Our goal as the Ben-Gurion University IGEM team of 2016 is to overcome this evolutionary hurdle by devising several approaches using synthetic biology tools for efficient plastic biodegradation.Genomic analysis of the aromatic catabolic pathways from Pseudomonas putida KT2440.", "design": "To provide us with a versatile vector, that will allow excision of a specific sequence from the designed insert if needed,  we added a restriction site between each element (gene or RBS).M259F - A \u0091hole\u0092 inside the protein core could be destabilizing to the protein structure.E. coli strain MG1655 was used for cloning of the LC-Cutinase genes into the pACYC vector backbone.Our chosen approach utilized a dialysis membrane with a cut-off of 12-14kDa, which is lower than LC-Cutinase s molecular mass, to enable the diffusion of the PET degradation products outside the bag for utilization by P. putida, while enabling a large concentration of LC-Cutinase inside the bag for efficient degradation of PET.Here are a few examples of mutations present in our mutated variants: A249P - Proline (shown in yellow) is added to increase the rigidity of the protein structure.Based on the structure of LC-Cutinase, we decided to use a rational mutagenesis approach, in which we introduce various mutations to the enzyme s sequence.In order to build a self-sustaining system in which part of the energy from PET could be utilized to make clean energy, we  We chose a bacterium that is proven to be electrochemically active (Timur et al 2007).The mutations were designed using the PROSS (Protein Repair One Stop Shop) algorithm, developed by the Fleishman Lab from the Weizmann Institute (Goldenzweig et al 2016).S257A - Polar side groups, such as a hydroxyl in Serine, with no hydrogen bonds, are destabilizing as the

leader sequence was obtained from the UC-Davis 2012 iGEM team (Part:BBa_K936013) and was amplified using primers containing restriction sites that match the pACYC backbone.Shredded PET was added to the dialysis bag and a magnetic stirrer was used to prevent precipitation.The algorithm uses the following steps in selecting the mutations: A sequence alignment was generated between the target wild-type sequence and other homologous sequences, from which several mutations were chosen.The restriction site had to be unique to avoid digestion of the genes or the vector backbone.Flanking each insert we designed and added homologous sequences to the desired target vector (224 or 434), for cloning with the NEBuilder\u00ae HiFi  DNA Assembly Cloning Kit.The flanking sequences also contained restriction sites for cloning into the multiple cloning site(MCS) of each vector.The mediator\u0092s formal potential should be adequate to the enzyme potential.We decided to use protocatechuic acid as it is part of the terephthalate metabolic pathway, which enables us to reduce the use of external reagents and to create a self-sustaining system.Containing 3 genes from C. testosteroni strain KF-1 for the transport of Terephthalic acid from the periplasmic  The genes involved in the Terephthalate degradation pathway and transporter were acquired from the Darmstadt iGEM team, 2012.Each mutant\u0092s structure was compared to the wild-type structure,  and the energy difference between them was calculated (??Gcalc).Containing 4 genes from the same strain of C. testosteroni for the degradation of Terephthalic acid to Protocatechuic acid \u0096 tphA1, tphA2, tphA3, tphB.At first, we examined the possibility of adding an electron carrier to the fuel cell,  as it was shown to be effective in enhancing the MFCs performance and was demonstrated using this species.We have chosen the pSEVA plasmids because they have been previously used in the P. putida KT2440 strain by the laboratory of Prof. D. Taufik at the Weizmann Institute.", "human_practice": "As an initial step to solve the plastic waste problem, we read the literature, learned what have already been done and met with several experts in different aspects of plastic waste:Prof. Alex Sivan, a scientist from the Ben-Gurion University who is an expert in microbial degradation of plastic waste.After learning about the LC-Cutinase, and making a comprehensive research about its properties we decided to focus on improving its PET degrading activity.Next, we consulted Dr. Sarel Fleishman, a scientist from Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, who is expert in computational protein design to improve enzyme activity.Finally, we aimed to learn about the current solutions for plastic waste.With the acquired knowledge, the magnitude of damage of plastic waste, and it became clear to us that we must find an effective and fast solution to deal with this problem.We also contacted Prof. Dan Tawfik and Dr. Halim Jubran from the Department of Bimolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, who provided the P. Putida KT 2440.In addition we met Prof. Amir Aharoni and Dr. Shimon Bershtein, two scientists from our university who are expert in protein engineering who study and improve complex biological processes.By visiting at Aviv recycling company, we saw and learned the process of plastic recycling \u0096 from the arrival of the plastic bottle to the plant to its reduction into raw plastic material made for the creation of other products.Finally, we discussed our plan and the project s design with our PIs concluding the valuable information to start wet lab work on our project.Furthermore, we done a comprehensive investigation of plastic s implications in order to learn and be able to raise awareness of the plastic hazard.Throughout the project, we met experts from the industry who utilize plastic in its raw state - Coca-Cola Company, Genome compiler and many more.We have learned about plastic s convenient properties such as flexibility, rigidity and lucidity that make plastic a popular raw material in the industry.Discovering that the current recycling process produces plastic waste that is not recyclable was eye opener, as it emphasizes the unmet need for biodegradation of plastic waste.One of the most interesting and important things we have learned is that 99% of the recycled raw plastic material is being used for products that cannot be recycled again.We consulted Prof. Sivan about our approach to a new solution for plastic degradation and learned that LC-Cutinase is an enzyme that is known for his ability to break PET bonds into two monomers: ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "The results show significant raising in the absorption but we didn\u0092t succeed to detect the TPA.The reasons why we

expressing LC-CutinaseCharacterizing E. coli growth inside a dialysis bag Characterization of the co-culturing of E. coli and P. putida - a controlled symbiotic approach Detection of TPA in plates containing PET and E. coli using fluorescence The bacterium Rhodococcus ruber R. ruber, known to utilize polyethylene (PE) as a carbon source, was grown in various liquid growth media with and without amino-acids and containing PE or PET pellets for a period of 30 days.Examining the utilization of PET by E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase In order to test the PET degradation ability of the LC-Cutinase enzyme variants, all variants were grown on M9 minimal medium plates with shredded PET pellets as a sole carbon source to test their ability to degrade PET.As seen from the results, our E. coli was able to grow with only PET as a sole carbon source, suggesting it utilized PET s degradation product, ethylene glycol, as a carbon source.(for detailed instructions on the preparation of the media see Protocols).Figure 28: E. coli expressing the codon-optimized(CO) LC-Cutinase grown on a M9 soft agar plate with shredded PET pellets as a sole carbon source.As seen from the images, the surface of the PET pellets is relatively smooth, there are some high crystallinity rod shaped structures but they are fairly covered.Figure 20: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days

from the image, both samples show growth, corresponding to P. putida s endogenic resistance and E. coli s plasmid acquired resistance to Chloramphenicol.Figure 42: Plate number 2 - samples grown on a

carbon sources for a period of 30 days.As seen in the images above, all LC-Cutinase variants were able to grow on the plates containing shredded PET, suggesting that the PET is degraded and E. coli is utilizing at least one of its products (we assume - ethylene glycol).The media containing plastic as the sole carbon source (PET, PE), reached higher O.D600 values from that of a medium with no carbon source (SM medium) but lower O.D600 than on glucose media or plastic enriched with AA media.Figure 32: E. coli expressing the R7 LC-Cutinase variant grown on a M9 soft agar plate with shredded PET

pellet in a X1000 magnification.Figure 6: A scanning electron microscope image of a PE pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X1000 magnification.For control, TPA presence was detected in plates containing E. coli transformed with an empty vector plasmid (the same vector used for expression of LC-Cutinase), and no bacteria at all.As proof of concept in the biofuel part of our project, Our test results may suggest that there is a potential in constructing a biofuel cell based on the electrochemical activity of P. putida KT 2440 with protocatechuic acid as an electron mediator.If our speculation was correct, the LC-Cutinase was supposed to be expressed from the E. coli, degrade the PET, and the bacterium could consume ethylene glycol from the degradation products.Here are the results of E. coli strain BL21 s growth with liquid M9 media containing ethylene glycol as a sole carbon source:Figure 27: E. coli strain BL21 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of EG for a period of 96 hours.That can be explained by the preferential degradation of the amorphous material exposing the better defined (higher crystallinity) material that goes through a slower degradation (Shah et al 2008).Figure 9: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.Figure 10: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.Figure 11: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.In order to assess the ability of our two chosen bacterial species - E. coli and P. putida to grow in symbiosis, a key element in our project s design, we cultivated both bacteria in a liquid LB medium, separated by a dialysis bag.Even though later tests with R. ruber show that the concentration of enzyme is an important part in efficiency of degradation,  we still decided to run these tests again, with equal enzyme concentrations on our 2 fastest variants - CO and F4:Figure 15: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of 3 LC-Cutinase variants - CO, F4 and the W.T., at a substrate concentration of 125?M.Looking at the entire design- our biofuel cell will consist of E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase that degrades the PET and consumes ethylene glycol (it includes the previous results in the E. coli ethylene glycol utilization results).In contrast, our results show no growth with TPA, which lead us to the conclusion that P. putida cannot utilize it as a sole carbon source.This experiment, although it cannot quantify the degradation efficiency, is another indication of the existence and activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme, and the ability of E. coli expressing our LC-Cutinase to utilize its degradation product- ethylene glycole.However, we have clearly shown that our bacteria can utilize PET as a carbon source using the LC-Cutinase protein, which is a proof-of-concept for one part of our project.Figure 44: PET plates (prepared as previously described in the PET Utilization experiment (Experiments Page), after colony growth, were exposed to UV light (as described in the Terephthalic acid detection assay (Experiments Page)), then tested in a fluorescence gel imager to detect TPA presence by excitation in 314nm end detecting emission at 426nm.We took samples from both PET and PE media (with pellets) and examined them with a Phase-contrast microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM):Figure 3: An image taken with a Phase-contrast microscope from SM media with PET after incubation with R. ruber.We can conclude from these results that our E. coli strain BL21, like other E. coli strains, can utilize EG as a sole carbon source, with an optimal concentration of 30mM.X1000 magnification.Figure 18: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days of incubation in a liquid LB broth with no bacteria.X1000 magnification.Figure 17: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days of incubation in a liquid LB broth with no bacteria.It should be mentioned that protocatechuic acid polymerizes in the presence of amine groups, a reaction that could interfere with the electron transfer, hence other more potent mediators will be explored including the operation of the biofuel cell without mediators, since P. putida are reported to produce their endogenous electron transfer mediators.We have demonstrated that creating a biofilm on a graphite anode can be easily done, making this part of our system applicable.As seen above, after incubation with the LC-Cutinase expressing bacteria, the surface of the PET is rougher than the control.X2500

Colony-PCR results used to the detect the presence of the aldA gene(1440bp) from E. coli shown on 1% agarose gel.Samples were left to incubate unopened for 3 months to test for the formation of biofilms.Figure 2: R. ruber biofilm formation on a PE pellet.In this experiment we grew E. coli strain BL-21 transformed with the pACYC vector containing the LC-Cutinase W.T.We have witnessed similar results with PET pellets, suggesting R. ruber can also utilize PET as a sole carbon source.As shown, plates containing E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase showed higher emission levels, which indicates of higher presence of TPA in the plates in question.Moreover, we see that E. coli remained viable throughout the experiment, verifying our hypothesis that it can grow inside a dialysis bag, and suggesting that our symbiotic design using a dialysis bag is plausible.We consider that result as an important step and a proof-of-concept of our final goal.gene grown in liquid M9 media with PET as a sole carbon source.Moreover, when comparing the bacteria expressing the LC-Cutinase gene and the bacteria transformed with an empty vector backbone, we see a clear difference in the texture of the PET.One method to assess the activity of our designed mutants was using the pNP-butyrate (pNP-B) degradation assay We ran the tests on all 5 variants of the LC-Cutinase protein with different concentrations of the substrate: Figure 12: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.It is important to note, that to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PET degradation by R. ruber is reported.We assume that this is the result of the PET degradation activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme.Those results are a consequence of a rupture in the dialysis membrane which occurred during the experiment.Reviewing these results leads us to the conclusion that the TPA degradation pathway must be cloned into the P. putida bacterium for efficient PET degradation.In order to test P. putida s ability to utilize TPA and PCA as a carbon source we measured O.D610 values for a period of ~100 hours with P. putida in liquid M9 media with either TPA or PCA as a carbon source.As seen from these results, all of our variants, including the codon-optimized Cutinase, have shown increased pNP-B degradation activity compared to the W.T.From these results we conclude that P. putida can utilize PCA as a sole carbon source, as previously reported.As seen from the results above, both bacteria maintained viability using our dialysis bag apparatus during the experiment.Samples taken from plates 1,3,6,7 and 10 were positive, suggesting they contained E. coli.Figure 41: Plate number 1 - samples taken from inside and outside the dialysis bag and grown over-night on a petri dish containing Chloramphenicol.As seen from the image, both samples show growth, suggesting that both samples contain P. putida, which has endogenic resistance to Ampicillin.It should be mentioned that it is not yet established that R. ruber is able to utilize PET as a carbon source.We have managed to show that out E. coli will be able to break down PET in conditions similar to those in our designed biofuel cell and to survive without any other carbon source.Controls are the same as with 50?M concentration.Figure 14: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.Contrary to our expectations, the untreated PET surface is smooth while the treated sample\u0092s surface seemed to have gone through degradation (fig.In the second day of measurements, there was a decline in power output probably due to cell death.As seen from the results, the Km values of our variants compared to the W.T.To prevent contamination, we used Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol (at 100?g/mL and 34.1?g/mL respectively) as selection markers.Figure 25: P. putida KT2440 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of PCA for a period of 96 hours.Please note, that when comparing the appearance of degraded PET between LC-Cutinase degraded PET and R. ruber degraded PET, they looked the  same, however, the difference was that it took a month to R. ruber to degrade PET to the observed picture (Fig.Moreover, our new LC-Cutinase genes consist of a PelB leader sequence that has been codon optimized to maximize expression levels in E. coli.5 and 10mM concentration were tested twice (\"a/b\").Figure 26: P. putida KT2440 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of TCA for a period of 136 hours.LC-Cutinase grown on a M9 agar plate no carbon source.Detection of TPA in plates containing PET and E. coli using fluorescenceAfter seeing bacterial growth on our PET plates, we wanted to combine our protocols of PET utilization and to detect the presence of TPA in our plates.Again, we can see that the CO and F4 variants have higher activity in regards to pNP-B degradation than the W.T.Figure 39: Colony-PCR results used to the detect the presence of the pcaD gene(792bp) from P. putida shown on 1% agarose gel.As part of our work with the P. putida KT2440 strain we wanted to test its antibiotic resistances, so we can select the appropriate cloning vectors.We cannot conclude which variant degrades the PET with the highest efficiency, as the PET in the plates is not evenly spread and the amount of PET degraded cannot be measured in this assay.Calculating the values from the CV measurements we found that the substance had a middle point Potential of E0 = 174 mV vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.Figure 43: Plate number 4 - samples taken from inside and outside the dialysis bag and grown over-night on a petri dish containing Kanamycin.For control we used E. coli strain BL-21 without any vector (\"BL-21\") with pACYC plasmid backbone only (\"pACYC\").Figure 13: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.That being said, more experiments are required in order to confirm our hypothesis and determine the proper concentrations of the protocatechuic acid and characterize the mechanisms with which it mediates P. putida s electron transfer.We also notice that the surface of the PET looks more porous and the rod shaped, high crystallinity PET, is more exposed than in the control.Which is an indication to the electroactivity of P. putida compared to control, with relatively high internal resistance.We can see a large increase in power output induced in the sample containing bacteria in the 250-500 mV range,  compared to the control.The internal resistance was measured in the first day with values of 60 ? for the cell containing bacteria and 1000 ? for the control.One control was PET pellets incubated for 2 days in LB liquid media with no bacteria.We speculated that in this case the EPS is used for the absorption of the PET micro particles and allows the accumulation of secreted enzymes.Moreover, when comparing the Kcat values of our variant to the W.T.Finally, we can see that the catalytic efficiency, portrayed by the Kcat/Km value, has been significantly improved in our variants, compared to the W.T.As seen from the image, no growth is visible in either sample.It can be explained by the ability of bacteria, i.e.", "safety": "\"Synthetic biology is a relatively new science with tremendous potential to change how we view and

regarding scientific research and progress.We thought that as we modify organisms in our lab enabling them to preform new functions,  we should learn our limitations and the complexities are involved in synthetic biology.(For example, at times, it was necessary to work with a chemical like Catechol, or to handle EthidiumSafe Project Design (Safety Risks to the General Public): Our final goal as

paper, \"Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View\u0094, Prof. Glick describes the Jewish approach towards scientific progress as well rounded and aware to the problems it presents: \"Judaism traditionally looks favorably on man as a co-creator with God and encourages research for the benefit of humankind.All of our project s lab members received safety training by our advisors, and had to partake in a lab safety online  course offered by the Ben Gurion University safety department.In order to ensure the safety of our product, we integrated into our design the self-destruct mechanism developed by the 2013 Ben Gurion University iGEM team.During the summer, we met several experts from the bioethics field, who gave us general new ethical insights that might be First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science.Thus, we learned that ethical issues need to be considered in many  Second, we learned that our designed product is encountered with a relativity new term called genetically modified organism  (GMO).In recent years, effective biosafety laws and regulations have been adapted by several countries to prevent terrorists and  other hostile powers from obtaining dangerous biological agents, technologies, or information that would allow them to  In 2008, the Israeli parliament (\"Kenesset\") decided to tighten biosecurity measures and legislated the regulation of  research into biological disease agents law, which provides a legislative framework to conduct research involved biological  disease agents.Furthermore, ethic  issues might arise during the research process.These principals are much alike some aspects  Familiarizing with the GMO concept, we discovered that there is a discrepancy between the way the public perceive bioethics and the way it is studied and practiced.But, in the Jewish tradition man is also charged with stewardship over nature and  is admonished to preserve and nurture, not just to exploit and destroy\".With this mechanism, not only the expression of our genes will be dependent on an IPTG inducer, but it will also force our E. coli to be fully dependent on an unnatural amino acid (UAA).In our project, we preformed multiple growth experiments using different intermediates in the PET degradation  pathway as carbon sources.Some of the chemicals have specific safety instructions according to their MSDS,  which were printed out and stored in the lab for all of the members to read and work according to.Synthetic biology promises significant advances in areas such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, agriculture, and medicine  Many concerns might stem from the field of synthetic biology.For instance, researchers confronts ethical questions regarding integrity, objectivity and authenticity during the research process.In the lab, we wear protective clothing and gloves at all times (unless working with fire).World-wide governments, including the federal regime in the USA, had a minor role in regulating and enforcing ethical  As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues.Many hold the view that  pollution is an insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care  for God s creation.Without supplying it to the bacteria medium, or in case of release to the environment (which will only happen by accident since we do not intend to release our bacteria), our E. coli bacteria will not survive.The Talmud which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, teaches  a basic ethical principle in Jewish law, the  Bal Tashchit  (\"do not destroy\") commend.Does a genetically modified organism can have a negatively effects on the environment or on human being?We found a quote from Rabi Moshe Ben Maimon (Maimonidas), a philosopher, scientist, polymath and one of the  most important adjudicators in the Jewish religion that lived in the Middle Ages :\"If men possessed wisdom, which stands  in the same relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye, they would not cause any injury to themselves or to others, for the knowledge of the truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual injuries\".The federal government in the USA and the European governments enforce all aspects regarding the research process, implementing rules and regulations.Third, we asked ourselves what is the potentially harmful consequences that may emerge when implementing new technology.We met with Prof. Shimon Glick from the  Faculty of Health Sciences (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be er-Sheva, Israel), an expert in the field of Jewish medical ethics.The law calls for the establishment of a council to regulate and monitor research on select infectious  disease agents.The federal government As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues.Our second bacterium, P. putida, which is design to consume TPA (one of the PET degradation products), would not be able to consume PET as it is dependent on LC-Cutinase (the enzyme which breaks the initial bond in the PET polymer into TPA and EG), since LC-Cutinase is expressed and secreted from E. coli.Such concerns  are also considered a biosafety matter as creating a GMO is accompanied with lots of uncertainties regarding its future effects on the environment.It also prescribes institutional committees with defined responsibilities and identifies means of control, Until the beginning of the 50 s there were no clear guide lines or standards for ethical behavior in conducting a research.Furthermore, GMOs is widely  We also learned that there are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, when a marked difference can be  found between the United states that favor for GMO products while Europe union is basically against.For example: Bacterium self - destruction switch mechanism that was developed by BGU iGEM Team 2013,  And allows to control the life time of the modified organism.Thus, the Jewish tradition would haves a positive attitude towards the current goals of synthetic biology.In the meeting Prof. Glick thought us about Jewish views of bioethics.In order to  enforce these regulations, government instructed the establishment of the Institutional Review Board (IRB).The lack of knowledge and the complexity of this field arise many  questions and concerns among the general public.(Prof. Bracha Rager-Zisman, Department of Microbiology  Immunology and Genetics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) .This way, the degradation process does not release any pollutants or toxins to the environment other than the  carbon dioxide and water bacteria produce in their own metabolic processes.The commend orders men not to waste or destroy our earth, the commend is invoked only for destruction that is deemed unnecessary.The Book of Genesis indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis emphasizes that

this is due to the difference in their degradation rates; while sok has a half life of 30 seconds, the half life of hok is much higher: of 30 minutes.Both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don\u0092t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.Additionally, both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don\u0092t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.In order for it not to be produced in higher concentrations than necessary, which can lead to the risk of it not being completely inhibited by sok, we have inserted only one hok sequence in this design.While the cells contain the DNA circuit and are inside the bioreactor, they will produce both the toxin and antitoxin, and will live.Therefore, the developed bacteria wouldn\u0092t be producing neither Lcp nor roxA, presenting no threats to usable rubber or to the environment.Although the simplified Hok-Sok kill switch mechanism proposed by our team allows, with low energy cost, the efficient and rapid death of the cells after leaving the bioreactor, it doesn\u0092t grant that cells inside the bioreactor which didn\u0092t inherit the developed DNA circuit die.As we use inducible promoters for producing the rubber degrading enzymes, if rhamnose isn\u0092t present on the environment, our genic circuit is off - presenting no threats.None of the used DNA parts in the main circuit has any direct relation with virulence and the organism presents low pathogenicity, besides being a commonly found bacteria.Besides the plasmid having an antibiotic resistance related part- on our first project design -, it is a known and common sequence, which can be easily obtained by DNA synthesis or acquiring the plasmid commercially, for example.If the bacteria is released from the bioreactor, it will be in an environment without rhamnose, and won t produce tetR - leading to the production of HokD, a protein that causes cell membrane depolarization, killing the microorganism.As the bacteria desired to survive will contain a plasmid with antibiotic resistance, it won\u0092t die - and all of the other bacteria will.This may be a problem to the process efficiency, as cells that aren\u0092t developing the desired processes will be competing for nutrients with the ones that contain the DNA circuit.A kill switch mechanism designed to be activated when the bacteria leaves the bioreactor was included in our DNA circuit.Brasil-USP team is very concerned about the project\u0092s biosafety, and considered it not only while working in the wet lab but also while designing our biological system.These acts as a physical containment for the developed bacteria and, therefore, minimize the risks of releasing it unexpectedly to the environment.Also, as these processes are being idealized to be performed in factories, only few people of the staff would have contact with the developed microorganism; and these would be specifically trained to minimize contamination - granting an even lower chance of the microorganism being released unexpectedly.The main molecule produced in this process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al), however there are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, it will be produced constantly while the cell is inside the bioreactor.The hok system promoter is changed to a constitutive one - so it will also be produced constantly.All the procedures applied in our team\u0092s project have been discussed with the members and no safety concerns were raised.Conditional suicide system for the containment of bacteria and plasmids.Our circuit uses inducible promoters (BBa_K91403; BBa_R0080; BBa_R0010), so if the trigger reactant isn\u0092t present our genic circuit is off, not producing the ODTD molecule, which might be toxic to the environment.This is how it works: the bacterial culture medium will contain rhamnose, activating the left part of our designed DNA circuit (Figure 1).In order to eliminate this issue, our team proposed inserting our circuit and the antibiotic resistance into the genome of the developed bacteria - avoiding horizontal gene transfer and the creation of potentially dangerous organisms.Therefore, no relevant risks to the environment were detected.On our first project design, however, we still depend on antibiotic resistance for maintenance of the desired plasmid.There are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, this strain is classificated in Risk group 1, and it meets the requirements of the US NIH.As the continuum use of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria and has been avoided by scientific community5, our team proposes a circuit that would be able to control these problems.The main molecule produced in this process is the 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD).Additionally, the E. coli BL21, contains several mutations silenced, and does not compete in the environment.It will not be constructed due to time issues, but it is idealized here (Figure 2).The circuits includes sok, a RNA antitoxin, under the rhamnose promoter; tetR is removed from the circuit.We are using a strain of E. coli that it s not supposed to survive greatly in the environment.In order to minimize the release of the developed bacteria to the environment, we were very careful in the disposal of biological material at the laboratory.For the proposed project, these contaminations will be controlled using antibiotics.All of the students involved in our project have received safety instructions for working at the laboratory.According to the DSMZ database, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are from the risk group 1, and does not offer any disease on healthy adult humans.For the Interlab study, we used E. Coli DH5-?.Unfortunately, physical containment alone isn\u0092t enough to ensure that the GMO\u0092s won\u0092t be released accidentally.If the kill switch fails, the bacteria will only survive in extreme conditions, which was a low probability to occur.O.

Coli without plasmid), confirmed by a Mann-Whitney U test.However, it is known that TatA is the most expressed gene of this pathway and it has 60% of homology with TatE, which can partially substitute TatA; TaTB can form a complex with TatC to prevent its degradation; there is evidence that TatC is the signal peptide binding protein and, finally, TatD produces no effect on protein translocation but has DNase activity.5 The secretion is composed by 12-16 different proteins, but none of these proteins have their specific roles elucidated.5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ompA mechanism is inserted in the type I secretion system which, in Gram negative bacteria, promotes the secretion of various proteins of different sizes and functions in one single step, without the necessity of a periplasmic intermediate.The proposed circuit provides the secretion of the proteins by the fusion with a specific signal sequence, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence, or its binding to the bacterial outer membrane by the fusion with a specific protein, OmpA fused with a linker (BBa_K1489002).We show in figures 2 and 3 our results.Figure 2 - Optical Density (OD) measurements over time, showing that all colonies were in their log phase.Figure 3 - Fluorescence per cell for each promoter, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.The first one aims to get the protein through the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and, for that, it can use three different pathways (the SecB-dependent pathway, the signal recognition particle (SRP), and the twin-arginine translocation (TAT)).Our results are in figure 4 and 5.Figure 4 - Fluorescence per cell for pLac, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.Unfortunately we weren\u0092t able to perform these tests, first due to our problems with promoter test and second because we are still in the circuit construction phase.We see that with IPTG, GFP activity incresases and RFP activity decreases, as it should happen.Figure 5 - Fluorescence per cell for each promoter, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.The second step is the protein translocation through the outer membrane, involving specific protein machinery known as the secreton.5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The TAT pathway, unlike the SecB or the SRP pathways, is capable of transporting folded proteins across the inner membrane independently of ATP using the transmembrane PMF (proton-motive force).5 This translocation system is composed mainly of five proteins (TatA, TatB, TatC, TatD and TatE) but their specific function have not been firmly established yet.Therefor we planned circuits with two exportation systems, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence and the fusion of the enzymes with the bacterial outer membrane, OmpA, to check which of these exportation systems were better for each of the enzymes.Not only the induced activity is lower than the activity without induction - for the first 3 concentrations of Rhamnose -, but also the RFP is also growing.BBa_K1819008 was submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts as a Brasil-USP team new part.Moreover, there are several large scale system established for E. coli use in industry and, since our project aim for industrial applications, we have chosen the E. coli system allied with the previously named secretion routes that might help increase enzymes  stability.Another possibility for our negative results is the wrong ligations between the parts, that again we just confirmed by agarose gel instead of sequencing.Figure 6 - Exportation test circuits (more information about the design of the circuits here).The protein being transported has a specific C-terminal signal sequence that usually has few to 50 glycine rich-repeats, that might be necessary for the protein function and, therefore, is not cleaved during the secretion6.These enzymes are fundamental for rubber degradation and have to be secreted or exposed in the exterior of the cell to be in direct contact with their substrate, the poly(cis-1,4 isoprene) - the main component of rubber.The exportation of RoxA ensures its passage through the bacterial periplasm which increases the chances of a correct folding of the protein.The designed circuits are shown in the figure below (Figure 6).The Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) system is classified as part of the type II bacterial secretion mechanism, which is composed of two steps.Figure 1 - Promoter test circuits (more information about the design of the circuits here).We intended to evaluate the exportations systems through GFP fluorescence, since this phenomenon depends on the correct folding of the protein, which in this case is linked with the folding of Lcp and RoxA.strain 35Y.1 However, most of these organisms show a slow growth when using rubber as a sole carbon source.2-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To improve microbial rubber degradation efficiency, our project aims to create a gene circuit which will, among other things, be responsible for coding and expressing two enzymes: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase A) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein).TAs mentioned earlier, our enzymes have to be secreted so they can be in contact with the substrate, moreover it\u0092s been seen that the heterologous expression of RoxA wasn\u0092t successful due to inclusion body formation.The secretion is driven by three proteins of the cell envelope6.The first one is located in the outer membrane, and is called OMP (Outer Membrane Protein); the other two are cytoplasmic membrane proteins, called ABC (ATP-Binding Cassette) and MFP (Membrane Fusion Protein).However, the choice of the promoter system is not as simple as the chassis .The Gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli is the most used chassis in Synthetic Biology.This signal sequence recognizes the ABC protein and triggers the assembly of the whole complex for the translocation process.Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed induction, i.e., induced fluorescence per cell was (statistically) significantly higher than our negative controls.Since we had no issues at all with any of our constitutive promoters (see for instance our Interlab Study, Pveg characterization in E. Coli, Linker-GFP part), our primary concern is that our protocols should be modified and optimized for induced promoters.Finally, no considerable changes were detected in the RFP measures.In the x-axis, the higher the concentration label, the higher the concentration, with zero means no induction at all.That being said, we designed circuits to test the viability of three different inducible promoters: Plac, Para and Prha (figure 1).", "safety": "If they leave the bioreactor, sok won\u0092t be produced, and the cell will die due to hok presence.For cells that didn\u0092t inherited the developed DNA circuit: these will contain Hok in their plasma, but not sok - this is due to the difference in their degradation rates;

BBa_R0080; BBa_R0010), so if the trigger reactant isn\u0092t present our genic circuit is off, not producing the ODTD molecule, which might be toxic to the environment.This is how it works: the bacterial culture medium will contain rhamnose, activating the left part of our designed DNA circuit (Figure 1).In order to eliminate this issue, our team proposed inserting our circuit and the antibiotic resistance into the genome of the developed bacteria - avoiding horizontal gene transfer and the creation of potentially dangerous organisms.Therefore, no relevant risks to the environment were detected.On our first project design, however, we still depend on antibiotic resistance for maintenance of the desired plasmid.There are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, this strain is classificated in Risk group 1, and it meets the requirements of the US NIH.As the continuum use of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria and has been avoided by scientific community5, our team proposes a circuit that would be able to control these problems.The main molecule produced in this process is the 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD).Additionally, the E. coli BL21, contains several mutations silenced, and does not compete in the environment.It will not be constructed due to time issues, but it is idealized here (Figure 2).The circuits includes sok, a RNA antitoxin, under the rhamnose promoter; tetR is removed from the circuit.We are using a strain of E. coli that it s not supposed to survive greatly in the environment.In order to minimize the release of the developed bacteria to the environment, we were very careful in the disposal of biological material at the laboratory.For the proposed project, these contaminations will be controlled using antibiotics.All of the students involved in our project have received safety instructions for working at the laboratory.According to the DSMZ database, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are from the risk group 1, and does not offer any disease on healthy adult humans.For the Interlab study, we used E. Coli DH5-?.Unfortunately, physical containment alone isn\u0092t enough to ensure that the GMO\u0092s won\u0092t be released accidentally.If the kill switch fails, the bacteria will only survive in extreme conditions, which was a low probability to occur.O. R. Faridani, A. Nikravesh, D. P. Pandey, L. Good, K. Gerdes Escherichia coli in the Environment: Implications for Water Quality and Human Health.All of the knowledge obtained in the course was applied on the project developed for iGEM.Graduated students have attended a course offered by S\u00e3o Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC/USP) about basic safety aspects, and then instructed undergraduate students about the precautions to be taken.The course included topics such as: the use of appropriated clothing and personal protective equipment; correct use of equipments such as autoclave, laminar hood flow, electrophoresis chamber and centrifuge; handling safety aspects and disposal of biological and chemical agents; specific danger of the main reagents used at the lab; and precautions about bioaerosol.The mechanism is expected to kill the cells almost immediately, with only a fraction of 1.4 x 10-4 the cells surviving after 90 minutes4.Therefore, the system is efficient for containing the microorganism spreading and its modified DNA

linker.In the experiment, we hypothesized that an elongated linker would enhance the function of the fusion protein for the original linker is too short for the proper folding of the two domains.However, we found no result in the previous history using this linker.So we went to the linker library in iGEM part registry website to search for a longer linker.Through the reference searching, we found that the previous research all used the three-alanine linker.(see Design & Device)This year, we have designed fusion proteins of spider toxin in conjunction with snowdrop lectin by the three-alanine linker.In the experiment(See the Link), the fusion protein with the elongated GS linker did show the enhanced repellent effect.Therefore, we modified the sequence and added three more amino acids into the linker in case it was still too short for proper protein folding.Observed from the phenomenon, we did prove the enhanced function of the fusion proteins, so we speculate that the fusion protein has a better secondary structure than the original ones.It is a revolutionary system that not only guarantees the safety of the farmers and customers worldwide but also safeguards the sustainability of the environment and ecosystem.", "design": "2001, 276, 40306\u009640312Elaine Fitches, Martin G.

[5]In nature, spiders inject venom into the haemolymph of insects\u0092 that causes the death of the prey.AnachnoServer is an online database that contains nearly 800 peptide toxin information from 78 spider species[1], and UniProt is a library of protein information.Also, snowdrop lectin is proved to be resistant to proteolytic activity in the insect gut.Another apprehension about nowadays insecticidal pesticide is that through bioaccumulation, the pesticide chemical residue will accumulate in the human body, and can\u0092t be degraded by us.The traditional pesticide will kill all the insects in the farmland no matter it is pest or not.The inspiration for Pantide originates from the food chain.The active site in the peptide that performs its toxicity are the amino acids located in loop regions.[6] Snowdrop Lectin recognizes the glycoproteins on the epithelial cell in the insect gut and facilitates the fusion protein to cross the epithelial cell by transcytosis.To tackle this problem, Pantide is species specific to several orders of pests, Hv1a targets Lepidopteran, Orthopteran, and Dipteran, Sf1a targets Lepidopteran, and Dipteran, OAIP targets Lepidopteran and Coleopteran.The devices in each area will collect the farmland conditions respectively, and the data will be transmitted to one host device in each area through Bluetooth, and then the host will upload the data of its area up to the cloud through WiFi.By using these three peptides alternately, the pest is hard to have resistance.For the practical application in the farmland, the farm will be divided into several areas, in each area, several sets of devices and sensors will be installed.Take Hv1a as an example for proving the stability of ICK; Hv1a is highly stable in the temperature range of -20\u00b0C to 75\u00b0C and pH values of 1 to 8.Sf1a is a toxic peptide derived from Segestria florentina (Tube-web spider).In this case, we chose snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) lectin as a carrier of toxin peptides to create a fusion protein.Spiders are one of the most successful terrestrial venomous creatures on earth.Hv1a is lethal to several insect orders but is not toxic to mice.; Christie, M.J.; King, G.F. \u0093Discovery and structure of a potent and highly specific blocker of insect calcium channels,\u0094 J.

protein works performs its toxicity better.In the two-hour test, we can see that most of the tobacco cutworms move to eat the negative control group, which proves the repellent effect of Pantide.After the three experiments, we have three conclusions.Pantide performs its toxicity as a repellent in vivo.The remained leaves area decreased as the concentration of PANTIDE decreased, which shows the dose response of Pantide.In comparison with the two other design, we could find out that the remained leaves area with improved Hv1a-lectin were all more than that of the original Hv1a-lectin and Hv1a.(a)

in an easy way, the testee selection, and experiment design would be briefly described.(Table 1)After amplification with PCR, the PCE products of Hv1a, Sf1a, and OAIP have a length of around 500bp? and Hv1a-Lectin, Sf1a-Lectin, and OAIP-Lectin has a length of 750bp~1000bp? and Hv1a-Lectin with GS linker has a length of 893bp.It shows in figure5.To use the p-value as an indicator of statistical significance, we compared Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin with the negative control; it shows that the remained leaf disk area of Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin are significantly different from negative control, shown in figure6.To sum up, the Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin work well in vivo.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification analysis of electrophoresis of seven PCR products with Marker labeled length on the left

have a length of 17kDa~19kDa.The T-test analysis in different dose of GS-linker improvement test.To know how the length of the linker affect the function of the fusion protein, we constructed Hv1a-lectin with the original three-alanine linker and a longer GS linker.The T-test analysis in different dose of OAIP/OAIP-lectin.In this experiment, we compared the toxicity effect of the three toxin designs including Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin/Hv1a-lectin with GS linker to test the toxicity effect.To know the qualitative toxicity effect of Pantide, we prepared the samples with the sonicated LB solution lysate containing Pantide-expressed E. coli Rosetta-Gami strain and diluted it with the three concentration.SDS-PAGE result of the seven purified Pantide products compared with the unpurified one, and with Marker labeled length on the left hand.In the following experiments, we used E. coli BL21 Rosetta-Gami strain to produce Pantide.The T-test analysis in different dose of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin.Figure4 shows the pictures of the remained leaf disks after twelve hours of feeding assays.The tobacco cutworms have a preference on the leave disks without applying Pantide.Although Pantide does not act as a biological pesticide as our hypothesis had mentioned, we may conclude that it is a biological insect repellent, which corresponds to our ideology of lowering the artificial impacts on the environment and simultaneously achieve effective pest control.Remained leaves in the GS-linker improvement test with the Hv1a, Hv1a-lectin, and Hv1a-lectin GS-linker improved.Figure14.All the experiments were to check the functions of Pantide for leaf protection, so the observation of the results would focus on the remained area of the leaf disks.The dose response is shown in figure5.Compared Hv1a with Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area in the Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a, which means the repellent efficiency of Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a.Figure11 shows the ratio of the remained area on the leaf disks.Figure5 shows the percentage of the remained area on the leaf disks.After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratios, we measured the area with the software imageJ.After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratio, we measured the area with the software

further purified Pantide to check whether it is well-expressed.The effect can be roughly ranked as:Hv1a-lectin > Hv1a > E. coli > Negative controlWe got the similar result in the Sf1a/Sf1a-lectin and OAIP/OAIP-lectin.Figure7.The p-value of the T-test can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other.In the test of Pantide toxicity, we chose tobacco cutworm as the testee for the insect appetite tests because all the Pantide targets lepidopterans.Remained leaf disks in the pre-test with the OAIP and OAIP-lectin.Figure11.Remained leaf disks in the pre-test with the Sf1a and Sf1a-lectin.Figure8.The observed phenomenon can be analyzed below.With the dilution of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area decreased, which indicates the dose response.SDS-PAGE result of the six Pantide-expressed sonicated products compared with the unexpressed sonicated one as a control and with Marker labeled length on the left hand.Afterward, we sonicated E. coli and then ran SDS-PAGE to make sure that Pantide fell into the correct ranges.The positive control in the experiment was to apply Bacillus thuringiensis on the leaf disks, which is nowadays the most widely-used bioinsecticide, and the negative control group in the test was DD water.This experiment is the pre-test that shows us whether the amount of Pantide is sufficient enough to perform the toxicity against the larvae.(Table 2)The gel of SDS-PAGE result is correct, and here is our result.Besides, there is also a Hv1a without the linker between the repellent peptide and the lectin served as a comparative sample.In the picture, it shows as a star.We hope that we can observe the difference of the three toxins in vivo.We applied the sample onto the leaf disks and put five cutworms into the separate cabinets for feeding assays.We preserved all the result of the remained leaves sealing with the glass paper and calculated the percentage of the remained area on the leaves.The results consist of three parts-feeding assay pre-test, the fusion protein improvement test, and preference test.The mechanism of the repellent effect is so far unknown.The toxicity efficacy of Pantide is equal to Bacillus thuringiensis.According to the mechanism of Pantide, Pantide is supposed to perform its toxicity in the nervous system of the larvae.(Figure 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g) As a result, the constructions of BioBrick were correct.Figure 3.With the elongation of the linker, the improved fusion protein has the best repellent effect.**Note: The word \u0093Pantide\u0094 in the following paragraph refers to the collection of all the toxin design in our project.Figure6 shows the p-value with the star attached to indicate P < 0.05 and two stars to indicate P < 0.01.B is the elution product of purification.", "safety": "To ensure that Pantide will degrade into amino acids when it is released into the environment, we have done an experiment to prove that Pantide does degrade in the ultraviolet light.Therefore, we should guarantee that Pantide is safe to humans and harmless to the environment.So, after we expressed Pantide with E. coli, the LB broth containing E.coli should be first sonicated by the sonicator to let Pantide be soluble in the LB broth.(See the experiment) Once we have known that Pantide will degrade in the ultraviolet light, we may conclude that Pantide will degrade in the natural light over time.One is the laboratory safety; the other is the safety of spraying Pantide into the environment.Before entering the laboratory, all the members in NCTU_Formosa must receive several training courses and evaluate exams offered by Environmental Protection and Safety Center.So it is harmless for the environment.With the degradation modeling simulation (See the Modelling), we may also apply the degradation rate into the automatic spraying device.For humans, Pantide will not have any negative effect on human health.As a result, we design a processing standard in the laboratory.When the customer gets the agricultural produce from the market, most of the Pantide is thought to have degraded into amino acids and even there is some residue of Pantide on the surface of the product.When it is washed into the soil or in water resources, Pantide is ineffective to the microbiomes and the vertebrate in the ecosystem.The content of the training courses consists of four parts.For the basic laboratory safety instruction, we learned the safety level of laboratories and personal protective equipment.For the laboratory emergency response, we learned of how to react to several emergency situations and certain procedure dealing with specific chemicals.For the toxic chemical operation and management, we learned the content of the material safety data sheet (MSDS).For biosafety, we learned biological hazard, including levels of biohazard and instructions of dealing with biological trash.The four training courses contain an evaluating exam.Instead, it can be as the fertilizer.The product we spray into the environment should not contain any genetically-modified organisms.SDS-PAGE gel and the concentrations of boiling test to native Hv1a-lectin (17.1 kDa).After taking the courses and passing the exam, we all get certificates for each training.In the future, we plan to spray Pantide onto the environment.", "keywords":

"Thus, the mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase that we design will be able to enzymatically distinguish the wild-type leucine from the protected leucine.Through research and experimentation, we determined that N-carbobenzyloxy-leucine (CBZ-leucine) fulfilled our criteria, and was also commercially available.The cleavage enzyme will remove the CBZ group from the CBZ-leucyl-tRNA, allowing for normal leucine to be incorporated normally into polypeptides.To accomplish this goal, we aimed to select a protecting group for leucine and a corresponding cleavage enzyme to remove the protecting group, and to replace the wild-type leucyl-tRNA synthetase with a mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase of our design.The biocontainment functionality of this system begins at metabolite uptake.In this way, the cell is incorporating normal leucine amino acids into proteins, while still being reliant on protected leucine.Our protecting group needs to bind to the N-terminus of leucine, as the C-terminus of the amino acid has to bind to tRNA.The amino-acyl-tRNA bond formation active site should be sterically altered to select for CBZ-leucine, and the editing site should also be changed so that it recognizes wild-type-leucyl-tRNA as an incorrect pairing.To implement this system completely, the genes for both the CBZ cleavage enzyme and for the mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase need to be readily transcribed and translated into functional proteins in the organism.Additionally, to ensure that leucine is not usable in the organism s metabolism, the wild-type leucyl-tRNA synthetase gene needs to be knocked out.Once its protecting group is removed, the wild-type leucyl-tRNA can continue on to polypeptide formation.The non-natural modified leucine, after uptake, would then be charged with tRNA molecule to become a modified-leucine-tRNA molecule via a synthetase enzyme.In this way, we would guarantee that the organism cannot survive without supplementation of the CBZ leucine.In our project, we aim to replace the leucyl-tRNA synthetase with a mutated version that will charge tRNA with CBZ-leucine instead of wild-type leucine.The mutant synthetase has two requirements: it should preferentially bind CBZ-leucine with tRNA, and also hydrolyze any wild-type leucine-tRNA that forms.The mutant has two active sites, one which creates the amino acyl-tRNA bond, and one which edits these amino-acyl-tRNA bonds.tRNA synthetase enzymes serve an essential step in the polypeptide formation pathway: they join amino acids and tRNA molecules to form aminoacyl-tRNAs, which go on to the ribosome to form polypeptides.We set out to create a device that would confer biocontainment on the translational level by modifying the cell to need a modified metabolite for survival.The cell must be able to take up a non-natural metabolite that is not typically readily available in the environment.Without the necessary metabolite needed to fuel our modified system, the cell is prevented from continuing translation.However, this step requires a modified synthetase so that the modified leucine, rather than wild-type leucine, is preferentially charged with tRNA.We needed to select an essential

"human_practice": "Working with the head of the Open Bio Labs, we created a biosafety guidelines document, including provisions on biocontainment.Not only did we work to improve awareness of and dialogue about biocontainment in the general public, but we also considered the iGEM community as another target audience.In response to these discussions, our team generated a sample policy proposal for the testing, application, monitoring, and termination of biocontainment devices in a released GEO.In the development of our method, we conducted interviews not only with synthetic biology experts, but also with individuals working in various industries that use microbes or genetically engineered organisms (GEOs).Feedback on our proposed biocontainment method from synthetic biology experts allowed us to reassess our project design, our definition of success, and how we would demonstrate that success.The results of this survey and our conversations with scientific and ethical experts informed the creation of a biocontainment pamphlet for the use of future iGEM teams.Despite the rapid growth of the field, several applications face barriers to implementation, including the lack of an effective, cheap, and easy-to-use biocontainment method.In addition to educating other teams about biocontainment, these conversations allowed us to gauge the current knowledge and concerns of the iGEM community.With industry experts, we discussed the potential for application of our biocontainment method in their companies or industries.As the field of synthetic biology moves out of its infancy, molecular biologists, community biology laboratories, and iGEM teams around the globe are making revolutionary discoveries with more frequency and greater impact.In July, our team facilitated a forum discussion about biocontainment at the University of Maryland\u0092s Mini-Jamboree event.At this event, we designed our own module and accompanying video to teach children and their parents about the purpose of biocontainment.We also created a widget that teams can utilize to determine the best biocontainment method for their project, depending on their specific concerns and implementation goals.To further improve public awareness on synthetic biology and biocontainment, we created two videos on these topics.Oftentimes, individuals working in relevant industries were very knowledgeable about the biological concerns raised by our methods and offered insight on the design or testing of our method.Additionally, we spoke to the main regulatory agencies of GEOs in the US about their current policies.However, while speaking to these experts, it was clear that lack of an acceptable biocontainment method was not the only barrier preventing implementation.", "modeling": "The following is a visualization of our mutant synthetase with optimal structure.Upon initiation, MUT asks for four main inputs: the protein pdb file that will be analysed, the residues that the program will mutate, the coordinates of the binding pocket for docking simulations, and a ligand pdb file.To perform mutagenesis on leucyl-tRNA synthetase, an integrated software script was written in the Linux shell, with inputs including a protein to mutate, a ligand, a list of residues of interest, and binding pocket location.Using a variety of protein-ligand docking software like CSM-lig, Autodock Vina and iGEMDOCK, we were able to confirm that AMS (the adenylating agent found in the literature) and AMP yield similar binding affinities to the synthetase when bound with leucine.Lastly, we performed Michaelis-Menten modeling for the enzyme pepsin to gauge activity in nonspecific cleavage enzymes.The leucine tRNA Synthetase (LeuS) used in the following simulations was found using the RCSB Protein Data Bank.After mutagenesis is complete files undergo stability testing and docking to determine if the new mutant is stable and a better match for the ligand.To select a protecting group, the team used protein-ligand docking software to compare binding affinities of several protected leucine/synthetase complexes.Should the results look bad, mutants from a lower ranking can be selected or new residues can be picked.Virginia iGEM designed a Linux-based protein engineering tool called MUT.MUT first performs stability testing and docking to get baseline values for the future tests before it mutates the initial PDB file.However, the binding affinities for all the protecting group choices were very similar, so we chose based on a different set of criteria.Another 4 data runs were performed and can be found in the supplementary data section, but exhibit similar results.Several programs were used to asses the viability of the different protecting groups in our system.Biochemistry 46, 4466\u00964472.To find residues of interest in the catalytic pocket, we used a combination of docking data as simulated in iGEMDOCK and of structural data visualized in Ligplot to determine additional mutational focci.The following is a PyMol visualization of the protein that we compiled.As stated in its documentation, during the characterization of 4aq7, a leucyl-adenylate analogue was used to determine the crystal structure of the protein.Energistic relationships between molecules of 4aq7 are shown in detail in the 2D representation, and conformational analysis can be conducted on the 3D image.The following residues were picked for mutagenesis.Residues that returned large values in the protected leucine simulations were believed to have a high impact on the reduced viability of docking.Once an initial ranking has be completed, the user has the option to rerun docking on the selected mutants to confirm the simulation.The user inputs to MUT a protein\u0092s PDB file, residues of interest for mutation, a binding pocket, and a ligand.The editing site mutation, Thr 252, allows for the hydrolysis of Leu-tRNA, a crucial step in our overall project.22Reference:Mursinna, R.S., Lee, K.W., Briggs, J.M., and Martinis, S.A. (2004).This program was used to query for the optimal mutant structure for Cbz-Leu docking.Residues that protruded around the N terminus of leucine, the location the protecting group binds to, were thought to be possible sources of steric hindrance.Three programs are used to accomplish this task: PyRosetta conducts computational mutagenesis, FoldX tests protein stability, and AutoDock Vina performs protein-ligand docking.Of the four mutations, one is in the editing site while the other three are in miscellaneous locations around the protein.After the simulation runs, the program outputs a top ten list of mutant structures along with their files.In order to determine the relative efficiency of our enzyme, we modeled another BioBrick.These are detailed in the following figure.Pugh chart used to score and rank possible protecting groups.First, the residue had to have been shown to have a high energy during docking.Some of the criteria are practical like the cost of the protecting group and enzyme.After the reductionist approach is complete, all files are mutated to four mutants and re-scored.We modeled our system in silico to select a sterically feasible protecting group and to optimize a mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase for complementarity of its catalytic site to protected leucine, and of its editing site to leucine.MUT utilizes PyRosetta, Autodock Vina, and FoldX to mutate, test, and rank protein structures based on docking scores.MUT generates mutant structures, subjects the resultant proteins to stability testing, and ranks the results based on protein-ligand docking data.Ligplot is capable of creating a 2D image of the binding site as detailed in the crystolography file.Files that fail the tests go to the kennels.BBa_M1436 codes for

approach.Below is a flowchart that explains the algorithm of the program.The kennel system allows for two levels of simulation.The script runs mutagenesis, assesses mutant protein stability, then performs ligand docking.This method ensures that all possible combinations of mutations is tested, but is computationally intense.After a run is complete, all files are automatically ranked and ordered by binding values (more negative is better).Thus, 4aq7 represents an protein that can accurately model our system containing leucyl-AMP and LeuS.The above figure shows select data from CSM-lig

second approach would have the advantage that it takes into account the efficiency of the genetic devices, because our experiments have shown that aspects such as operator placement and translation efficiency have a great impact on the functionality of the biosensor and are difficult to predict.For the future, we envision that a model with optimized parameters could be used to predict a range of repressor concentrations for an optimal output signal and the desired sensitivity.Therefore, we investigated several crucial design aspects with our model.Simulated sfGFP production when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 8 nM repressor plasmid are used (blue lines) or when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 300 nM repressor dimer are present (green lines).A CFPS biosensor is an open system, which means that the components can be manipulated more easily than in a whole-cell biosensor.There are two fundamentally different operating modes with regard to the repressor: It can either be encoded on a plasmid and be co-expressed with the reporter, or the protein is already present in the reaction mixture.When the reporter:repressor ratio is too high, there is a strong background signal and the relative increase in the presence of an analyte is small and would be difficult to discern (orange lines in the figure).The same analyses could be performed in order to optimize a reaction with a purified repressor.Importance of the reporter:repressor plasmid ratio.As can be seen from the figure, there is a weak background signal when a repressor plasmid is used, because it takes some time until enough repressor has been expressed to suppress the expression of the reporter.According to the model, the fluorescence in the presence of the repressor plasmid should be significantly lower than in the presence of a \"neutral\" plasmid, which competes for resources but does not encode a repressor.In contrast, when the repressor protein is already present in a sufficient amount, there is no background signal and the signal in the induced state is twice as high.In view of these results, a pre-existing repressor protein is the better option for a CFPS biosensor.In contrast, when the ratio is too low, an induction is not possible because of the strong repression and because most resources are used for the expression of the repressor (blue).Moreover, the signal in the presence of an analyte is weaker due to the competition of reporter and repressor mRNA for resources.We then compared the results to a simulation in which the same amount of repressor dimer was present from the beginning.Otherwise, further tests and adjustments to the model parameters are necessary in advance.Using this procedure, it is also possible to generate test strips that include several spots that detect the same analyte, but give a signal at different analyte concentrations.This would allow for the amount of repressor to be precisely controlled.The results showed us that the ratio of the plasmid concentrations is very important for a functioning biosensor.Our model accurately describes the expression of sfGFP in our cell-free protein synthesis and is able to predict the effects of the competition of two plasmids for resources.We chose this operating mode for the characterization of our biosensors and used a cell extract that had been prepared from cells expressing the necessary repressor or activator.One crucial component is the repressor, because its amount is decisive for the sensitivity and background signal of the biosensor.Furthermore, when the intensity of the fluorescence is to be used for quantification, it is possible to obtain a larger linear range using several spots with different detection limits.Currently our model uses parameters for repression and induction which were determined for the lac operon.To analyze the differences, we modelled a CFPS reaction with equimolar amounts of reporter and repressor gene in the non-induced and fully induced state.Given the parameters of our model, a ratio of 1:1 yields the best compromise between low background and strong induced signal (green).We tested this prediction with a plasmid that encodes the arsenic repressor and a second plasmid that contains the arsenic operator in front of sfGFP (BBa_K1758300).For future applications it would therefore be desirable to determine the specific parameters of the repressor proteins we worked with.This is a convenient method, however, it would be an even better option to add a purified protein to the reaction.8 nM of each plasmid were used.The position of the arsenic operator relative to the T7 promoter in the PT7-arsO-UTR-sfGFP plasmid is not ideal, as the distance needs to be very small to efficiently block the T7 RNA polymerase (Karig et al.Plasmids encoding sfGFP, either with the arsenic operator (arsO) or without, were combined with plasmids encoding the arsenic repressor (arsR) or mRFP1.A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that in the absence of an analyte, the translation rate constants are most important for the output signal.Therefore, the model could significantly reduce the number of necessary experiments.Therefore, we looked more closely at the importance of the plasmid ratio.This is sufficient for making qualitative predictions about the behaviour of our biosensors, but it does not enable us to predict exact concentrations for the different biosensors we used.These concentrations could then be tested in the lab.Therefore, the amount of active ArsR was likely lower than predicted by the model.These results show that the model predictions are only valid for optimized genetic constructs and CFPS conditions.", "notebook": "Find out how we developed and optimized our own cell extract.See

approach had to be established and the processing of the output signal had to be taken care of.To detect the date rape drug ingredient ?-hydroxy butyrate (GHB), we had to adjust only two components of our setup: The repressor protein and the DNA sequence that the protein recognizes.By the way, you just have to spend 16 \u00a2 for each reaction At first, you have to combine all reagents that are necessary to conduct cell-free protein synthesis.We consider our cell-free biosensor an outstanding instrument for the detection of harmful substances in liquids.Our measurement prototype for easy and

"Considering biosafety aspects it has to be unequivocally proven that the purified protein extract and plasmid DNA preparation are cell-free.In his opinion, the risk that possibly released DNA from our system is incorporated by competent cells and that these cells proliferate and spread out is so low and unlikely that it is negligible.Regarding biosafety, it would be a clear advantage if reproduction would not be occurring in the CFPS environment.2013), DNA is a molecule that bacteria from the environment can coincidentally absorb (C\u00e9r\u00e9monie 2004) and that therefore can affect the environment.To conclude, we think that in future applications PRIA can be used outside of the lab under the condition that these concerns are addressed properly.For further assessments of PRIA s biosafety status we interviewed Dr. Mathias Keller from the district government in Detmold (\"Bezirksregierung Detmold\").He lists examples for the environment where a close contact between DNA and cells are likely to occur, like sewage treatment plants, our digestive tract and the soil.In conclusion, our expert assured us that cell-free systems are safer and better to use for the user than cell-based systems.We asked how the district government deals with the release of DNA from genetically-modified organisms into the environment.For the use of these systems one does not need to be a user of a genetic engineering facility.DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2013.00005 Nielsen, Kaare M.; Johnsen, P\u00e5l J.; Bensasson, Douda; Daffonchio, Daniele (2007): Release and persistence of extracellular DNA in the environment.We want to do a risk assessment to determine to which extent DNA is released in the environment when using PRIA.This is true no matter how the DNA is produced.Guan, Zheng-jun; Schmidt, Markus; Pei, Lei; Wei, Wei; Ma, Ke-ping (2013): Biosafety Considerations of Synthetic Biology in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition.According to Dr. Keller the release of pure DNA is not governed by the German Genetic Engineering Act.So to which extent is the biosafety affected?Moreover, the release of DNA happens permanently.Cell extract is generated by cell disruption, for example via sonification, followed by centrifugation steps in which the cell debris are separated from the molecular machinery needed for CPFS (see CFPS protocols).(2015) who \u0096 by creating an ebola sensor \u0096 showed how cell-free synthetic biology can be a medium to transfer the findings and ideas from the lab to the field.We contacted experts in the field of cell-free biology and asked them about this topic.Biologically/chemically he sees as advantages that the stability, durability and insensibility against external impacts in cell-free systems are considerably higher than in cellular systems.That points out the public awareness when it comes to microbiology and genetically modified organisms.However, none of these problems occur when the system is cell-free.(2013): Preparing synthetic biology for the world.It is also possible to modify the DNA that is used: For example it is conceivable that it includes a kill-switch or comparable safeguards (Moe-Behrens et al.We wondered if it was possible to create a biosensor based on cell extract that is completely cell-free.We consider this a great contribution to the iGEM community.According to Dr. Keller, the uptake of DNA depends on the uptake frequency, the encoded genes (e.g.Therefore, it is important that there are no GMOs in the product.One of those is for example the problem that GMOs are brought outside of the laboratory.PRIA is an in vitro method and can be compared to ELISA, an assay which is broadly used for example in hospitals (Lequin 2005), in terms of biosafety.conferring antibiotic resistance or encoding toxins) and the selection advantage for the transformed cells.Although the cell disruption is very efficient (we had a maximum of 8 colony forming units in 100 \u00b5L of final cell extract), there are still some cells left after this procedure.At first glance, our two approaches the PRIA and CFPS differ when it comes to biosafety concerns.Projects based on cell-free approaches will probably benefit to a great extent from our findings and results.The Act just deals with the handling of GMOs.Sun, PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology explains: \"[...] we have seen both cases where colony forming units come out of the extract and when they don t.\"Although plasmid DNA persists only to a minor degree in host cells (Moe-Behrens et

climate problem and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nowadays, the human civilization has achieved unprecedented prosperity.Our previous experience has shown that if we want to build a closed-living

developing the entire circulation system design from the bottom and making full use of the advanced functions among different species, avoiding weaknesses, ultimately achieving material circulation and life support efficiently without any pollution.\"[10] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1960s, several major advanced countries and organizations tried to build a enclosed environment by the Earth s biological regeneration of life support system to simulate material recycling process in space environment.Since 1989, the European Space Agency (ESA) has cooperated with several agencies to launch the MELiSSA, a microecological life support system research program.The ultimate goal is to include multiple compartments to achieve complete closure of the water and gas cycles.we can\u0092t just simply \"add or subtract\" biomass but search for the new ideas,develop the entire circulation system design from the bottom and make full use of the advanced functions among different species, avoid weaknesses, ultimately achieve material circulation and life support efficiently without any pollution.Even the most advanced life support system, the International Space Station (ISS), can only work as a partial closed-loop system, circulating oxygen and controlling pressure.Furthermore, scientists have been neglected the role of microbes in the overall simulation system until they found the important effects of microbes in the entire simulated closed ecosystemlater.Finally, the efficiency of energy utilization and material recycling in natural ecosystems is too low,which requires a large number of ecological space in order to satisfy the astronauts  living requirements (average 100 square meters per person).And the whole story of survival reflects the core idea of the astronauts life support system - recycling everything that can be recycled.Astronauts material consumption reaches 11 tons / year, while the spacecraft to transport 1kg of goods will cost $ 10,000.If Human wants to fly out of the earth like the interstellar travel in science fictions, the primary task is to maintain a reliable system of life support.To solve the complex problems of long-term space travels such as material cycling and life sustainment relying on the existing biological resources of the earth s ecology,we face the challenges including the cost,volume, flexibility and availability.[11] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1970s,the former Soviet Union successfully constructed BIOS-3 enclosed material circulation system, which could achieve 100% of the water cycle and gas circulation.The whole system was completely isolated from the outside air and water, but the system failed to achieve the basic material quality balance, and ultimately failed.For the past half a century of human exploring space, the entire system is basically non-renewable, So it is called Open Loop System.Astronauts can easily obtain a variety of supplies, including food, water and oxygen generators, and achieve the circulation of the waste.It is only performing short-term tasks or in orbit on the International Space Station.Because the biological platform has a self-replicating function and the flexibility biology, there has been a very marginal and mysterious branch, Space Synbio.Space biosynthetic biology will be a catalyst for the development of synthetic biology and the aerospace industry.In 1986, Edward Bass from the USA established a private laboratory, \"Biosphere 2\", to see whether it can create a completely closed life-support system, and all the lives in system live in harmony.Manned space flight only reached the moon from the time when the first human rocket was launched.At present, space exploration continues to expand, from near-Earth orbit to deep space exploration, from landing the moon to Mars survival which may come true in the future.However, due to the neglect of themicroorganisms,which isa very important loop in the system,the closed experiment only lasted for two weeks in such system.The platform of synthetic biology ensures that the search process is more reliable.[7] In this process, it is difficult to bring all the air, food and water needed.From 1968 the release of \"2001 space roaming\", so far, most of the ideas in the film have been realized, except for the space roaming.Artificial simulation is difficult to achieve.The second is that the stability of the natural ecosystem is based on the huge biomass,but the one of the small-scale simulation system is frail.Designing the travel plans to go to the moon and Mars or even further place is very different.He used human excrement, Mars soil and the water from rocket explosion to grow potatoes.University of California, Berkeley, Adam P. Arkin summed up six major challenges of the space The challenge can give people the power to innovate and inspire imagination.Over the past 20 years, we have cut down over 130 million hectares of forest, but only get 47.5 million hectares of arable lands [2].Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project[J].In the film, Mark lived in the desolate Mars, making the

became an unavoidable and insurmountable problem for scientists.", "description": "We hope to use E.coli to realize the re-use of carbon dioxide metabolized by astronauts, like green leaf, and to synthesize Glycogen which can be reused by astronauts,using formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.This is the part that connects the front and the back of the entire Blue Leaf project, and also determines whether the entire device can be used to synthesize starch with a carbon compound as the sole carbon source.The route cannot synthesize Glycogen with only one carbon compound as the sole carbon source, and is not suitable for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.In the first part, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.The device,which can maintain the carbon cycle in the

validation of this pathway and the efficient expression as well as the catalysis of both enzymes.Figue4, Part II, New Synthesis of D-xylulose by Formaldehyde Assimilation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third part, Glycogen Metabolism can be used to synthsize D-xylulose into Glycogen.The use of mature carbon dioxide fixation technology turns the carbon dioxide in the air into formic acid[3], and then gets formaldehyde which is the sole carbon source by specific enzyme.[5] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, in order to enhance the efficiency of the combined catalysis, we used synthetic protein scaffolds technology[6].The second part is the new formaldehyde condensation pathway which can achieve the efficient synthesis of D-xylulose from formaldehyde.[1] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last year, the iGEM team AACHEN2015 used E.coli to design a pathway for Glycogen by methanol.However, the five carbon compound needs to be obtained by E. coli from other glycolytic pathways.Though they aimed at using methanol to form glycogen, in fact,they overlooked one of the most important aspects![4]Figue3, Part I, Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide.[2]They used electric conversion to get methanol,which is the raw material.From the 1960s, the former Soviet Union, the United States, the European Union and other space organizations have tried to construct bio-regenerating life-support system under earth  s closed environment in order to simulate the material recycling process in space environment.The former can turn formaldehyde condensation into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and hydroxyacetaldehyde.The latter condenses two intermediate products into a five carbon sugars Compounds: D-xylulose.This year, we have designed a new carbon cycle system.In other words, E. coli must consume at least one molecule of six carbon sugar to synthesize a glycogen hexose sugar monomer.\"Rapid Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by an Iridium Pincer Catalyst Immobilized on Carbon Nanotube Electrodes.\"We have optimized the protein scaffold sequence and performed functional validation on the basis of the iGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team.For a closed system such as a spacecraft, how to maximize the recycling efficiency of material and energy in order to maintain the astronauts\u0092 long-term space activities has become an inescapable but difficult problem for scientists to overcome.", "design": "But this idea about utilizing the Methanol Condensation Cycle and Glycogen Metabolism into the synthesis of glycogen has stimulated us greatly.To synthesize Glycogen in the presence of one-carbon compound as the sole carbon source, we need to find or even design a new pathway for the synthesis of five carbon saccharide from formaldehyde.A simple and effective method for the complex reaction involved with so many enzymes should be found to enhance the interaction and cooperation within each enzyme and improve the efficiency of the overall reaction.The toxicity of the formaldehyde is high and unstable, especially for the cells.The synthesis of glycogen was achieved by using the synthetic route of formaldehyde to D-xylulose, the partial methanol assimilation pathway and glycogen metabolic pathway.Figue 6, Formic acid to formaldehyde conversion pathway.[4] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We improved the scaffold protein on the basis of the IGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team[5] and used it in our designed pathway-from formaldehyde to D-xylulose.Thus, based on the ways to fix the carbon dioxide by electro-transformation, a one-carbon product with low toxicity and high electro-conversion efficiency should be found, and then we design the pathway of it to assimilate.Though this new approach, we have achieved the synthesis of D-xylulose by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.It is beneficial for the synthesis of carbohydrates to use formic acid as carbon source.However, in this synthetic pathway, an obvious defect lies on the additional requirement of a five-carbon sugar used together with methanol and then to form glycogen.This route aforementioned cannot be used to synthesize Glycogen only with one carbon compound as the carbon source, so as to be deficient for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.Besides, we applied this part in our scaffold protein(BBa_K2155012) with other cohesins, and proved it was functional.Figue 4, CO2 Reduction Thermodynamics & The Strategy of Hydrogenation of CO2 to Formic Acid.This part is \u0093Bearing before and after\u0094 part in Blue Leaf as well as the determined factor of whether the entire device can achieve the synthesis of starch by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.In order to improve the efficiency of the multi-enzyme reaction system, Self-assembly Protein Scaffold was used.It transforms methanol into formaldehyde that will be condensed into six-carbon sugar with five-carbon sugar produced in E. coli, and then goes to the subsequent glycogen polymerization.Since the photosynthesis efficiency of plant is only about 1%[1] , it is clearly not a practical way to use the green leaves to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft where the space is narrow while the demand for energy is huge.The scaffold protein consists of the following components:Figue 3, Synthetic protein scaffolds improve the efficiency of multi - enzyme reaction.Last year, the iGEM team from Aachen University of Technology in Germany[2] designed a synthetic pathway for Glycogen with the methanol from E.coli and finally won the Best manufacture prize.The system, in other words, will convert carbon dioxide into the sugar compounds offering heat supply, so as to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft and ensure the astronauts  long-term space travel or space presence.Based on a registered cohesin(BBa_K1830004) submitted byiGEM15_Concordia\u0092s, we isolated the cohesin module of this part from the linker, which makes following team could adjust linker\u0092s length according to their requirement when they use this cohesin.In the next route, we used Methanol Condensation Cycle.Design a system to achieve the re-use of carbon dioxide in the spacecraft.D-xylulose was phosphorylated to 5-phosphate-xylulose and then went into the methanol assimilation pathway.We found two enzymes with different condensation functions, BFD and TalB , the former could condense formaldehyde into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and Glycolaldehyde.In this way, the target protein could be anchored firmly to the scaffold.Therefore, the linker\u0092s length is a main influence of multi-enzyme system\u0092s reaction efficiency.Amazingly, the conversion efficiency could be more than 80%.Cohesins were expressed on the scaffold, while Dockerins co-expressed with the target enzyme to form a fusion protein.Microscopically, it could automatically assemble the fusion protein with the corresponding Dockerin, making different enzymes next to each other.We know that complex enzyme reaction often has a problem that the products of the last enzyme cannot be timely and competely transported to the next enzyme, making the overall reaction efficiency low due to the location of different enzymes in the space far apart.There are few pathways of formic acid assimilation in nature, and we have searched through the literature to find a path that has been validated.In the case of Blue Leaf, a system in which multiple enzymes catalyze the reaction, the efficiency of the coordinated reaction between the enzymes determines the efficiency of the overall catalytic reaction.Cohesins and Dockerins were the major components of protein scaffolds, each with a reactive group that recognizes each other and mosaics.They got the methanol,which is the raw material, through the electric conversion.[8] Moreover, the toxicity of formate is much lower than that of methanol.So our experiments also focused on the validation of this pathway and the efficient expression and the efficient catalysis of both enzymes.From the macroscopic point of view, it can improve the local enzyme concentration and substrate concentration, thereby enhancing the multi-enzyme reaction system.\u0093Computational Protein Design Enables a Novel One-Carbon Assimilation Pathway.\u0094 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 112(12): 3704\u00969.It is clear that formic acid is more suitable as a sustainable carbon source than methanol.[9]Figue 5, Investigator Peng Kang, from TIPC of CAS, designed a electrical device which can transform carbon dioxide into Formaldehyde.", "human_practice": "And we went to the laboratory to study the related mature theories and the first time

"modeling": "Since we have demonstrated the pathway to convert methanol to D-xylulose in vitro, herein, we would like to look at its possibility in vitro by using stoichiometric In a short word, a stoichiometric model is a combination of reactions related to target molecules which form a metabolic network that could offer bird view of For this work, we built up the model based on present model of E.coli from CellNetAnalyzer(Steffen and J 2007), and added our reactions into it.Besides, the production of D-xylulose was increased because of supplement of other reactions.Figure 1 The

Different stationary phase temperature: by reducing the temperature we might be able to reduce growth and obtain more Curdlan  Yeast cell walls are naturally made up of various layers which are represented in the following diagram.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 68: 163\u0096173  [2] R. Zhang and K. J. Edgar (2014) Properties, Chemistry, and Applications of the Bioactive Polysaccharide Curdlan.Curdlan belongs to the class of biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses.Plos one 93:525\u0096531 To sum it up, we would like to produce Curdlan in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then sulfate it before spraying it on grapevine leaves as a preventive treatment against Downy mildew infections.Therefore, the only alkali soluble components are a mix of (1?6)-?-glucans(1?3)-?-D-glucans.We therefore decided to over-express the Curdlan metabolic pathway by inserting into yeast (INVSC1 strain ) an inducible promoter (Gal1) for the ?-glucan synthase gene (Fks1) hoping that this would allow the cell to produce Curdlan in greater quantities.Annu Rev Immunol 20:197\u0096216 [13] Jagodzinski PP, Wiaderkiewicz R (1994) Mechanism of the inhibitory effect of curdlan sulphate on HIV-1 infection in vitro.We rapidly eliminated Bacillus subtilis from our possible hosts due to its lack of enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of (1?3)-?-glucans (Figure 5).In addition, curdlan gels have medical and pharmacological potential, for example in drug delivery through sustained and diffusion-controlled release of the active ingredient.The protective effects for the bacteria are due to the fact that Curdlan forms a capsule that completely surrounds the outer cell surface of bacteria.(aimanianda et al 2009) In order to separate the two compounds, we plan on using (1?6)-?-glucanases in order to obtain a solution of (1?3)-?-glucans and therefore our Curdlan molecule.All the other Curdlan clinical applications in cancer, diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia etc.\u00bb  \u00ab Because, as we explained on the problem page, Downy Mildew is a real problem for the Aquitaine region.This is demonstrated by the study of a double mutant of pmr4 which restore the susceptibility to mildew.Glucan molecules are polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers linked by glycosidic bonds and one of them is called Curdlan , a (1?3)-?-D-glucan.Also, activation of a Pathogenesis-Related protein called PR1 in grapevine is regulated by the salicylic acid signaling pathway .[16] To conclude, activation of natural defenses before the invasion of pathogens is a way to improve the plant resistance against infection and to reduce the use of chemicals products.Figure 2: Schematic representation of the (1?3)-?-glucan synthetic pathway [2]  Before starting the project, we took a few weeks to decide which host organism we would use and how they could be useful.We planned on amplifying our fragments by PCR and creating different biobricks with different assemblies of our genes and plasmids in order to find the effect of each gene on Curdlan production and to verify the efficiency of our promoter.The safety of Curdlan has been assessed in animal studies and in vitro tests [4,5] and it is approved for food use in Korea, Taiwan and Japan as an inert dietary fibre.Furthermore, non-sulfated Curdlan doesn t trigger the response through a mutant gene: pmr4.[10] Furthermore, Curdlan derivatives are members of a class of compounds known as biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses.This is the medium which is used for Curdlan production in Agrobacterium and is also interesting since it is a minimal medium which allows us to easily vary parameters and optimize production.Gal1 promoter and HIS3 was extract by PCR from pFA 6a-HIS3MX6-pGAL-3HA .On the other hand, we will integrate the FKS1 gene into the iGEM plasmid pSB1C3 to get our BioBrick that we ll send to Boston.However, we found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae naturally produces Curdlan in its cell wall, like Agrobacterium.This is not the case with E. coli in our project.First, we decided to produce Curdlan with Escherichia coli , because Agrobacterium tumefasciens because both of them are Gram negative bacteria and have a lot of membrane similarity.We therefore inserted the three genes which code for the ?-glucan synthase and metabolic transporters in Agrobacterium (crdASC) into E. coli .In: WHO (ed) 53rd Meeting of the joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives.For example, it can have antitumor, anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities (see other properties of Curdlan).Commonly, the yeast cell wall is made of 5-10% of (1?6)-?-glucans and 50-55% of a mix of (1?3)-?-glucans and (1?3)-?-glucans.So, sulfation of the glucan would counteract the negative feedback effect.In Agrobacterium , three genes (crdA, crdS and crdC) are required for Curdlan production.However, more research is needed for the further development of these useful properties, in particular by reducing the cost of production.CRC, Boca Raton, pp 269\u0096286 [5] Spicer EJF, Goldenthal EI, Ikeda T (1999) A toxicological assessment of curdlan.In order to have control over the different culture perameters we also decided to use M63 culture medium.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 68: 163\u0096173  [2] M. McIntosh (2012) Recent advances in curdlan biosynthesis, biotechnological production, and applications.[1] M. McIntosh (2005) Curdlan and other bacterial (1?3)-?-D-glucans mini review.The capsule formation is correlated with cell aggregation (floc formation) and it is suggested that the capsule and floc formation together function as protective structures in cases of Nitrogen-starvation of the post-stationary phase.We then tried to put a inductive promoter ahead of the relevant gene by homologous recombination.[1]  [1] M. McIntosh (2005) Curdlan and other bacterial (1?3)-?-D-glucans mini review.Indeed, Curdlan production in Agrobacterium requires Nitrogen Starvation and its growth parameters need to be relatively precise.All three genes were synthesized by IDT separately with the correct ends to allow integration in the iGEM plasmids and an easy creation of our biobricks.Since the layer of mannan and proteins as well as chitin is insoluble in alkali solutions, beta glucans are easily separated from the rest of the yeast cell wall.Trends Glycosci Glycotechnol 4:309\u0096317 [10] Kanke M, Tanabe E,(1995) Application of curdlan to controlled drug delivery.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 93:525\u0096531  [3] Adrien Gauthier (2014)The Sulfated Laminarin Triggers a Stress Transcriptome before Priming the SA- and ROS-Dependent Defenses during Grapevine\u0092s Induced Resistance against Plasmopara viticola.However, site-directed mutagenesis may be necessary when integrating the gene into the plasmid because there are restriction sites (EcoR1) that are unwanted within the HIS3 gene.The results indicate that the chemical modification of an elicitor, such as sulfated derivative of \u00df-glucans, could improve its resistance-inducer efficiency.However, since our gene sequences for crdA, crdS, and crdC originally come from Agrobacterium we decided to optimize our gene codons for E. coli with IDT codon optimization tool in order to make sure that our gene would correctly be expressed.konjac glucomannan, methylcellulose), the heating process alone produces different forms of curdlan gels with different textural qualities, physical stabilities and water-holding capacities.Manipulation of the conditions for self-assembly may allow the engineering of new materials.", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "", "notebook": "In our Notebook we provide a summary of our labwork and an overview over the used protocols.", "protocol": "", "result": "The primers used for PCR have floating tails allowing the integration of the cassette upstream FKS1 gene.Thanks to Derek Mc Cluster we tried to overexpress FKS1 gene by integrating GAL1 inducible promoter upstream of it by the homologous recombination method.The amplification product containing the selection gene and the promoter flanked by the homologous recombination of sequences is purified.For that, we designed PCR primers that flank the gene of interest taking into account the issues of specific primers to the target sequences, self-aliasing or primer annealing there between.To insert FKS1 gene into the chosen plasmid, it was necessary to amplify this gene by PCR on yeast genomic DNA.One of the first strategies to overexpress the FKS1 gene encoding a D-glucan synthase was to insert it into a plasmid compatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We designed a pair of primers specifically hybridizing upstream of the gene of interest and framing the location where construction must integrate.?

present in soluble form in healthy patients.In food industry, the additive E424 (Curdlan) is used as a thickener, stabilizer, gelling and firming agent.However, we also collaborated with the Oxford iGEM team to test the toxicity of this molecule on the bacteria that already live in nature.For the Environment Even if copper is essential for life at low doses, it is environmentally toxic at higher doses.Also, the copper-related risks are increased if added residues of this product from agricultural cultures, other food sources containing copper as tap water.This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer s disease.This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer s disease.For Humans Through the food chain, copper is an essential element for life at low doses.Indeed, when it is accumulated in the body in large quantities, it is supposed to affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain.If we want to directly use our synthetic organism on the plant, we must integrate death genes in their genomes to create organisms that are not be able to live in natural conditions.In our project, the cell can\u0092t evolve and in any manner alter the environment.After different doses were tested, an encouraging result emerged : the weekly fructose application of 100 g / ha had a similar effect than a treatment of 600 g / ha of copper.Indeed, when it accumulates in the body, it is in too large quantities, it would affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain.In 2013, the \u0093Savoy ADAbio\u0094 tested on vine plants the effect of very low doses of different sugars in order to replace the copper treatment in the fight against pests.This element has been used many times to treat mildew which has resulted in it\u0092s accumulation in the Aquitaine region.In the case of our project, we are not planning on directly applying our genetically engineered bacteria on the plant but only our purified molecule.The measure reduces the damage to the biosphere but isn\u0092t sufficient: copper sulfate is tolerated but not banished.This molecule already exists in nature, it is naturally present in the yeast\u0092s wall.Compared to copper sulfate which is a toxic compound, this molecule seems to be more environmentally friendly.In other words, we chose to spray on the vine only the cell product: Curdlan.We are not using the entire cell Another important theme is the spread of new organisms in nature.However, it is harmful if swallowed or inhaled, in cases of skin contact, eye contact (hence the compulsory wearing of gloves masks and glasses during our project) and is very toxic to aquatic organisms.In the lab, there is a specific solvent cabinet for liquid wastes.No bad impact on the environment has been identified.For now, we are still waiting for the results.The team who worked in the lab received instructions of lab safety with safety training.Most products used are classified as non-hazardous (even for the sulfation protocol).It accumulates on the soils and vineyards are polluted.It disrupts, for example, the development of mycorrhiza fungi that live in symbiosis with the plant\u0092s root to help the access to nutrients from the soil to the vegetal.To avoid confusion about the terms \"biosecurity\", \"biosafety\" and \"biohazard\", some people gave a definition of each of these terms.Since we worked with non-toxic organisms as Escherichia coli (BL21) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Invsc1), all waste that has been in contact with bacteria was put to bacterial waste in aseptic conditions but no specific security procedures needed to be put in place.This compound also modifies the biosphere since it is toxic for worms and microorganisms living in vineyard soils.We learned how to act in the case of an accident, where to find emergency showers, fire extinguishers and emergency doors.Not dangerous for Humans Our project aims to use a polysaccharide which is synthetically produced by our genetically modified organisms.It is also increasingly referred to as an \"environmental illness\".In humans, it is known that copper occurs naturally and in normal

enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and working for the UC Davis C-STEM Center.I am currently manager of the UC Davis Biomedical Engineering Molecular Prototyping and BioInnovation Lab.I joined iGEM for the experience of using biology to solve a real world problem.This summer I worked on several methods of quantifying the signal produced by our biosensor.This summer I produced an app that calculates

Genomics major at UC Davis.University of California Davis, Department of Computer Science and UC Davis Genome Center My lab\u0092s interests span a variety of topics related to evolutionary, synthetic and systems biology.Most recently I have worked on the redesign of naturally occurring enzymes for the degradation of immunogenic gluten proteins, to develop a novel CO2 fixation pathways, and design of a novel anthrax therapeutic.My name is Muntaha Samad and I am a third year at UC Davis studying Computer Science and Engineering.I decided to join iGEM, because I was interested in the engineering approach and view iGEM has towards biology.I contributed to the project mostly through outreach and wastewater collection.I have been an advisor to UC Davis iGEM teams for the past 5 years and have enjoyed every minute of it.I also assisted with hardware and hardware testing.University of California Davis, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and School of Medicine  My scientific efforts are focused on combining computational and experimental tools to develop a fundamental knowledge of enzyme catalysis, and applying those principles to design novel proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest.This summer I worked on the wet lab components of our project including experimental design and data analysis.Currently I am working with an international community on the development of Rosetta computational methodology for predicting and designing macromolecular structures, interactions, and functions.I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Biomedical Engineering and hope to one-day own my own biotechnology business.I am very interested in the engineering and design of power grids, as well as in transistor organization for processors and microprocessors.I also really enjoy robotics and am interested in pursuing a career working with smart prosthetics.I first found out about iGEM while i was at my junior college by my biology professor.I also contributed to the outreach of the project and sample collection.For this endeavor I worked closely with Gabe to first understand the biology behind our biosensor and then with various educators to figure out the most effective way to present this information.She told me about the competition after i had expressed interest in genetic manipulation and synthetic biology.My primary interest is to improve mentorship and educational opportunities for students interested in applications of systems and synthetic biology.I joined iGEM because I think there is a lot to learn from nature in designing more adaptive, resilient, and efficient systems.This summer I led our team\u0092s efforts in exploring our problem space and iteratively refining our project goals.My current focus is on the design of novel biofuel and commodity chemical biosynthetic pathways, the development of novel therapeutics, and the general understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function.I

wiki.", "background": "", "description": "They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme\u0092s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan\u0092s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan\u0092s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303.It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water\u0085Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samplesContinue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds\u0085 or 1 60-fold)Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallelWhen we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan.In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!Triclosan\u0092s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH.Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan.Cognizant of these two points, we developed an \u0093antimicrobial awareness app\u0094 to extend our solution more broadly.In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels).Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi!IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI.*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme.We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition dataTriclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3].Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28].As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI.We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water.However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and functionScience Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationshipsLearning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and functionIn regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:Providing a teacher\u0092s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.These include a teacher s guide, classroom powerpoint, and assessment questions -- all of which can be downloaded below: Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting.The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally: be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae).\"Kinetic and Structural Characteristics of the Inhibition of Enoyl (acyl Carrier Protein) Reductase by Triclosan.\"In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn\u0092t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our projectOf the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18].From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI\u0092s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19].Nature 485(7397): 185-194.Rodricks, Joseph V. \"Triclosan: A Critical Review of the Experimental Data and Development of

synthesis.Notwithstanding, NADPH is significantly more expensive than NADH[24], so instead of accommodating for S. aureus FabI, we decided to remove it from the FabI team.We were down to the \"Fab 5\".An alternative substrate was thus necessary for our biosensor to be used in a practical setting.To achieve our goal of developing a cost effective triclosan biosensor then, we were tasked with (a) discovering an enzyme that met all of our criteria and (b) identifying an alternative substrate that would enable practical use.(2001) 48 (1): 1-6. doi: 10.1093/jac/48.1.1[12] Mechanism and Inhibition

a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.The second obstacle Ms. Moriarty mentioned are the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum.pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA.(2000) \u0091Inhibition of InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by triclosan and isoniazid\u0092,Biochemistry, Vol.We realized early on that if we wanted to promote responsible chemical use, we had to go about the issue responsibly ourselves.We found all living organisms except for the Archaea, who synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it\u0092s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI\u0092s from different organisms[5].\"Structural basis for the variation in triclosan affinity to enoyl reductases.\"The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA\u0092s role as an acyl carrier.Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are \u0093good\u0094 or \u0093poor\u0094 distractors, answer choices designed to test common misconceptions, and common statistics like the \u0093facility factor\u0094 and \u0093discrimination factor\u0094 that test how easy or hard a particular question is and how well a question help to discriminate different skill levels in a class, respectively.1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry (Bba_K771303), 3 FabI proteins taken from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae.To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution.We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum.We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae.[11] Courtney Slater-Radosti, Glenn Van Aller, Rebecca Greenwood, Richard Nicholas, Paul M.

Antimicrob.This meant making a concerted effort to understand the complexities of the issue, learning from the past and present in developing a viable solution for the future, and assessing the implications of our proposed solution.After identifying public awareness as an effective catalyst for change, we researched civic engagement initiatives and identified that successful civic engagement measures fostered a sense of individual and collective responsibility and provided a sense of agency that s grounded in reality.Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.Mechanism and inhibition of the FabI enoyl-ACP reductase from Burkholderia pseudomallei.\"Common themes in redox chemistry emerge from the X-ray structure of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase.\"Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay.\"Enoyl-ACP Reductase (FabI) of Haemophilus influenzae: Steady-State Kinetic Mechanism and Inhibition by Triclosan and Hexachlorophene.\"Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al.(See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex.Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.In explaining the first iteration of the lesson plan, which involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement, Ms. Moriarty raised some valid concerns.\"Slow-tight-binding Inhibition of Enoyl-acyl Carrier Protein Reductase from Plasmodium Falciparum by Triclosan.\"Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices.Pagliarulo talked about how designing an educational activity is a process by which you identify objectives and criteria for success, come up with a prototype, test it, evaluate it based on criteria, and iteratively refine it.What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.We didn\u0092t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle.We later found out we didn\u0092t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent!This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g.aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12].As a result, we identified high school students as a potential audience and a lesson plan as a viable medium for promoting responsible chemical use.(May 2009)[6] RJ, Heath, Rubin JR, Holland DR, Zhang E, Snow ME, and Rock CO. \"Mechanism of Triclosan Inhibition of Bacterial Fatty Acid Synthesis.\"Validation of the survey instrument would require us to assess statistics known as \u0093validity\u0094 and \u0093reliability\u0094 [REF #.3].A good educational plan has a plan for assessing the quality of the assessments too.Dr.[18]In addition, the commercially available native substrate for FabI (crotonyl-CoA) is unstable and costly.Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, \u0093antimicrobial footprint app,\u0094 to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20].10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00284.x [19] Eriksson M, Johansson H, Fihlman V, Grehn A, Sanli K, Andersson MX, Blanck H, Arrhenius \u00c5, Sircar T, Backhaus T. (2014) Long-term effects of the antibacterial agent triclosan on marine periphyton communities.We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day.Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, we connected with CRS\u0092 network of teachers in our area -- just a portion of their network of 1,400 teachers.[21]In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run.Moriarty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being constraints imposed by lack of funding and needing to teach to a curriculum.In regards to budget constraints Mr. Moriarty talked about the difficulty in planning field trips due to lack of funding.We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme\u0092s activity on trans-2-pentenal.We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM.The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme\u0092s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme\u0092s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/B.One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction.To screen a representative subset of FabI\u0092s from all available domains of life, we mined the literature and found every characterized FabI with published inhibition data.Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan.To instill a sense of agency, we wanted to engage students in a hands on activity; however, current methods of detection are not well suited for a classroom environment.Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10].However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay: and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.This need motivated our wetlab effort in developing a reliable and cost effective triclosan biosensor that could be used in conjunction with our lesson plan to raise awareness and accountability around triclosan use.We then took a step back to assess the possible implications of our lesson plan.It was unclear however which of the thousands of FabI enzymes we should use for our biosensor since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a FabI gene.While we are excited to share our lesson with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope.A. Koenig, A. S. Beatty, Developing assessments for the next generation science standards (National Academies Press, 2014).Ref #.2 Russell, J.Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set.These require different assessment instruments.assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we\u0092re interested in assessing but rather the student\u0092s ability to decipher the questions.[22] Vick JE, Clomburg JM, Blankschien MD, Chou A, Kim S, Gonzalez R.Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) supports efficient operation of a functional reversal of ?-oxidation cycle.[18])We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI.\"Triclosan causes toxic effects to algae in marine biofilms, but does not inhibit the metabolic activity of marine biofilm bacteria.\"\"Antimicrobial Spectrum of Triclosan, a Broad-spectrum Antimicrobial Agent for Topical Application.Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use.We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens.He gave us some insight:crafting \u0093layered\u0094 questions that assess different levels on Bloom\u0092s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom\u0092s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom\u0092s questions might test a student\u0092s ability to apply the core lessons to new situationsdifferent objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.We couldn\u0092t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA.In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.Ms.To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout.We harkened back to Bruce Hammock\u0092s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum\u0092s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another.Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a \u0093pre post test\u0094.What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost.We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part.Percent inhibition was calculated by:The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme.Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute.Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents.100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADHWe are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen.To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid.This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.Dr.\"Triclosan Offers Protection against Blood Stages of Malaria by Inhibiting Enoyl-ACP Reductase of Plasmodium Falciparum.\"We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry!Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment?Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale.The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory.(2008) A pathogenic fungi diphenyl ether phytotoxin targets plant enoyl (acyl carrier protein) reductase.Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students.And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.We decided to use our device\u0092s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion.[32] Bornscheuer, U. T., G. W. Huisman, R. J. Kazlauskas, S. Lutz, J. C. Moore and K. Robins (2012).We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond.Human practice issues motivated our project and have informed its design every step of the way.This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences.To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.Ms.[28] Perozzo, R., M.

Zhang and Rock (2005).The insights gained from these numerous conversations informed the shape and development of our lesson plan at multiple levels, including the teaching resources that are required to use it in the classroom.", "design": "They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme\u0092s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan\u0092s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan\u0092s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303.It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water\u0085Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samplesContinue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds\u0085 or 1 60-fold)Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallelWhen we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan.In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!Triclosan\u0092s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH.Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan.Cognizant of these two points, we developed an \u0093antimicrobial awareness app\u0094 to extend our solution more broadly.In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels).Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi!IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI.*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme.We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition dataTriclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3].Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28].As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI.We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water.However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and functionScience Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationshipsLearning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and functionIn regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:Providing a teacher\u0092s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.These include a teacher s guide, classroom powerpoint, and assessment questions -- all of which can be downloaded below: Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting.The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally: be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae).\"Kinetic and Structural Characteristics of the Inhibition of Enoyl (acyl Carrier Protein) Reductase by Triclosan.\"In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn\u0092t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our projectOf the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18].From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI\u0092s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19].Nature 485(7397): 185-194.Rodricks, Joseph V. \"Triclosan: A Critical Review of the Experimental Data and Development of

5\".An alternative substrate was thus necessary for our biosensor to be used in a practical setting.To achieve our goal of developing a cost effective triclosan biosensor then, we were tasked with (a) discovering an enzyme that met all of our criteria and (b) identifying an alternative substrate that would enable practical use.(2001) 48 (1): 1-6. doi: 10.1093/jac/48.1.1[12] Mechanism and Inhibition

Antimicrob.This meant making a concerted effort to understand the complexities of the issue, learning from the past and present in developing a viable solution for the future, and assessing the implications of our proposed solution.After identifying public awareness as an effective catalyst for change, we researched civic engagement initiatives and identified that successful civic engagement measures fostered a sense of individual and collective responsibility and provided a sense of agency that s grounded in reality.Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.Mechanism and inhibition of the FabI enoyl-ACP reductase from Burkholderia pseudomallei.\"Common themes in redox chemistry emerge from the X-ray structure of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase.\"Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay.\"Enoyl-ACP Reductase (FabI) of Haemophilus influenzae: Steady-State Kinetic Mechanism and Inhibition by Triclosan and Hexachlorophene.\"Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al.(See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex.Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.In explaining the first iteration of the lesson plan, which involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement, Ms. Moriarty raised some valid concerns.\"Slow-tight-binding Inhibition of Enoyl-acyl Carrier Protein Reductase from Plasmodium Falciparum by Triclosan.\"Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices.Pagliarulo talked about how designing an educational activity is a process by which you identify objectives and criteria for success, come up with a prototype, test it, evaluate it based on criteria, and iteratively refine it.What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.We didn\u0092t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle.We later found out we didn\u0092t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent!This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g.aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12].As a result, we identified high school students as a potential audience and a lesson plan as a viable medium for promoting responsible chemical use.(May 2009)[6] RJ, Heath, Rubin JR, Holland DR, Zhang E, Snow ME, and Rock CO. \"Mechanism of Triclosan Inhibition of Bacterial Fatty Acid Synthesis.\"Validation of the survey instrument would require us to assess statistics known as \u0093validity\u0094 and \u0093reliability\u0094 [REF #.3].A good educational plan has a plan for assessing the quality of the assessments too.Dr.[18]In addition, the commercially available native substrate for FabI (crotonyl-CoA) is unstable and costly.Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, \u0093antimicrobial footprint app,\u0094 to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20].10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00284.x [19] Eriksson M, Johansson H, Fihlman V, Grehn A, Sanli K, Andersson MX, Blanck H, Arrhenius \u00c5, Sircar T, Backhaus T. (2014) Long-term effects of the antibacterial agent triclosan on marine periphyton communities.We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day.Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, we connected with CRS\u0092 network of teachers in our area -- just a portion of their network of 1,400 teachers.[21]In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run.Moriarty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being constraints imposed by lack of funding and needing to teach to a curriculum.In regards to budget constraints Mr. Moriarty talked about the difficulty in planning field trips due to lack of funding.We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme\u0092s activity on trans-2-pentenal.We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM.The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme\u0092s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme\u0092s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/B.One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction.To screen a representative subset of FabI\u0092s from all available domains of life, we mined the literature and found every characterized FabI with published inhibition data.Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan.To instill a sense of agency, we wanted to engage students in a hands on activity; however, current methods of detection are not well suited for a classroom environment.Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10].However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay: and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.This need motivated our wetlab effort in developing a reliable and cost effective triclosan biosensor that could be used in conjunction with our lesson plan to raise awareness and accountability around triclosan use.We then took a step back to assess the possible implications of our lesson plan.It was unclear however which of the thousands of FabI enzymes we should use for our biosensor since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a FabI gene.While we are excited to share our lesson with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope.A. Koenig, A. S. Beatty, Developing assessments for the next generation science standards (National Academies Press, 2014).Ref #.2 Russell, J.Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set.These require different assessment instruments.assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we\u0092re interested in assessing but rather the student\u0092s ability to decipher the questions.[22] Vick JE, Clomburg JM, Blankschien MD, Chou A, Kim S, Gonzalez R.Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) supports efficient operation of a functional reversal of ?-oxidation cycle.[18])We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI.\"Triclosan causes toxic effects to algae in marine biofilms, but does not inhibit the metabolic activity of marine biofilm bacteria.\"\"Antimicrobial Spectrum of Triclosan, a Broad-spectrum Antimicrobial Agent for Topical Application.Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use.We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens.He gave us some insight:crafting \u0093layered\u0094 questions that assess different levels on Bloom\u0092s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom\u0092s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom\u0092s questions might test a student\u0092s ability to apply the core lessons to new situationsdifferent objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.We couldn\u0092t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA.In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.Ms.To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout.We harkened back to Bruce Hammock\u0092s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum\u0092s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another.Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a \u0093pre post test\u0094.What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost.We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part.Percent inhibition was calculated by:The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme.Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute.Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents.100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADHWe are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen.To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid.This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.Dr.\"Triclosan Offers Protection against Blood Stages of Malaria by Inhibiting Enoyl-ACP Reductase of Plasmodium Falciparum.\"We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry!Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment?Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale.The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory.(2008) A pathogenic fungi diphenyl ether phytotoxin targets plant enoyl (acyl carrier protein) reductase.Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students.And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.We decided to use our device\u0092s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion.[32] Bornscheuer, U. T., G. W. Huisman, R. J. Kazlauskas, S. Lutz, J. C. Moore and K. Robins (2012).We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond.Human practice issues motivated our project and have informed its design every step of the way.This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences.To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.Ms.[28] Perozzo, R., M.

Sakaiensis originated at a recycling plant, we thought to contact labs that have discovered bacteria in wastewater treatment facilities.Because Seabin is still in development, we brainstormed possible future integrations of our sensor device with their platform.This encouraged us to try thinking of locations where we could find bacteria capable of metabolizing terephthalic acid.Thus, the energy produced by our MFC will help send a signal back to researchers to indicate the location of plastic in the ocean.We had up to this point wanted to use the electricity generated by our MFC to power a floating device like the Seabin.And, while the Seabin may be too large to suck in microplastics, our system would actually work better with microplastic because they are easier to break down.", "modeling": "Using the paper as a blueprint, our team constructed a model in Matlab (code available at the bottom of this page) that enables its users to enter values for adsorption, desorption, and catalysis constants and values for initial substrate and enzyme concentrations to immediately receive values for the Michaelis-Menten constant and the percentage of substrate that is bound to the enzyme at any point in time.The paper, \"Calculation of Protein Extinction Coefficients from Amino Acid Sequence Data\",5 guided us through the process of finding this crucial coefficient for a wavelength of 280 nm and allowed us to use the number of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine amino acids present in PETase to arrive at an extinction coefficient of 39170 M-1 cm-1.As our team and mentors investigated more sophisticated variations of Michaelis-Menten, we uncovered a highly relevant paper, \"Surface Enzyme Kinetics for Biopolymer Microarrays: a Combination of Langmuir and Michaelis-Menten Concepts\"4.Since our assessment of enzyme kinetics was purely comparative (that is, we judged the efficiency of surface kinetics by comparing them to kinetics in solution), we focused our investigation on the parameters that are unique to surfaces: adsorption and desorption.Supporting Future Experiments: Calculating Extinction CoefficientsDuring our wet lab work with PETase this summer, we managed to successfully isolate the enzyme.To understand conditions involving small pieces of plastic, our team relied on Michaelis-Menten, a widely-applied model for enzyme kinetics.Although we have the necessary tools to measure the optical density (OD) of a solution that contains PETase, OD measurements are not sufficient on their own to determine concentration because we do not know how much light the enzyme absorbs.This is where modelling comes into the picture.\"Surface Enzyme Kinetics for Biopolymer Microarrays: A Combination of Langmuir and Michaelis-Menten Concepts.\"Though PETase is the most efficient PET-degrading enzyme discovered to date,1 it by no means degrades plastic instantaneously.Below is the equation from the paper that enabled us to determine the extinction coefficient: Although this technically the coefficient for the denatured protein, the paper states explicitly that there is a \"relatively small difference\" between this coefficient and the coefficient of the native protein at 280 nm.However, we soon realized that the Michaelis-Menten model, with its references to substrate concentration, assumes that the substrate is in solution and would therefore be unsuitable for describing the kinetics associated with large solid substrates.An overview of Michaelis-Menten:3 The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) corresponds to the substrate concentration at which the speed of the reaction is half of the maximum possible velocity: Our team initially intended to compare the Michaelis-Menten constant associated with small plastics suspended in solutions to that of large pieces of plastics.It is valid at the beginning of reactions and is especially compatible with our reactor design considering that the products of the reaction are funneled to another chamber where none of the original substrate or enzyme are present.In future quantitative experiments involving PETase, it would be useful to have a means by which we could calculate the concentration of this enzyme in a given solution.In order to calculate the concentration of enzyme present, our team also needs to know PETase s extinction coefficient.The task required us to understand enzyme kinetics under two broad sets of circumstances: When the pieces of plastic were small enough in size so that they were effectively suspended in a solution.Another assumption is that the enzyme must be either free or bound to the substrate.Informing our Design: Modelling Michaelis-Menten KineticsAs we were refining the design of our plastic-sensing device, we were having a difficult time accounting for the lag between plastic uptake and plastic degradation.Prior to beginning our work, we ensured that the assumptions inherent in the model were reasonable for modelling PETase activity:2The model assumes that the product is not converted back into the substrate.The assumption also makes sense considering that our enzyme functions by breaking down polymers: after the reaction, the newly formed monomers no longer fit in the enzyme s active site.This would require us to apply models geared towards heterogeneous reactions that involve interactions between a solid substrate and an enzyme in solution.The extinction coefficient of an enzyme describes how much light the enzyme absorbs at a given wavelength.We realized that understanding degradation rates as determined by enzyme kinetics would allow us to adjust our reactor design to minimize the lag in signal.It states that it is reasonably accurate to calculate it \"directly... from amino acid

"protocol": "", "result": "Further, this is evidence that the induction system we designed has strong control over PETase-sfGFP expression because we see almost no absorbance when the cultures were uninduced, and strong absorbance otherwise.In conclusion, this validates that PETase is catalytically active with our sfGFP fusion.tsuruhatensis Metabolizing Terephthalic Acid (TPA)Now that we have catalytic PETase and have optimized pH for our engineered E. coli, we want to be able to produce a signal in the presence of our PET degradation byproduct, terephthalic acid (TPA).Plastiback can be easy to use with a fluorescent \u0093systems check\u0094 and also break down PET.Now that we have the PETase enzyme working, we want to optimize the pH to have the most enzyme activity and fastest growth rate of E. coli.Because our recombinant PETase protein is the only his-tagged protein in the cell, we would expect to see a signal only from the band which contains PETase.This demonstrates that D. tsuruhatensis and the exogenous mediator are successfully working together in the microbial fuel to produce electricity from terephthalic acid, and that we are able to read out a signal from the presence of terephthalic acid.Unexpectedly, we also see a PETase-sized band in lanes 2,3, and 4, which should only have a band at 70 kD for the PETase-sfGFP fusion.In the visualization experiment, we can also test whether our inducible system is working because we would expect uninduced cells not to fluoresce, or at least fluoresce at a low basal level.They also confirm that we have inducible control over our construct because the uninduced sample shows basal expression.Delftia tsuruhatensis TPA utilizes TPA as the sole carbon sourceSelecting Exogenous Mediator Type and ConcentrationBefore we could test our MFC with D. tsuruhatensis and TPA, we had to determine which exogenous mediator would be optimal for our MFC.If you are wondering what the dark band below the PETase band is, it is lysozyme that we used in our cell lysis protocol.Constructed BioBricks for PETase and confirmed presence of protein using sfGFPConstructed BioBricks with secretion systems for PETaseValidated PETase expression through SDS Page and Western blotValidated PETase enzymatic activity through pNPB substrate assayCharacterized growth of three bacteria species in TPA minimal mediaDemonstrated TPA signal can be detected by voltage increase in microbial fuel cellAfter constructing our system, we needed to prove that it functions the way we designed it to.Although we confirmed the presence of our protein with sfGFP visualization, an SDS Page will further confirm by showing that a protein of the correct weight is being expressed.Not willing to sacrifice this ease-of-use feature, we set out to show that PETase-sfGFP could still be catalytically active.We adapted an assay used by the UC Davis 2012 Team that could characterize PETase\u0092s esterase activity with a colorimetric readout.Additionally, we see a band at 70 kD in lanes 2 and 3, which is the expected size of PETase-sfGFP fusion.Yoshida et al (2016) A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate)As shown in the graph below, there is a big dropoff in growth between pH 8.5 and pH 9.0, therefore the happy medium between E. coli growth and PETase enzyme activity is around pH 8.5.In conclusion, this Western demonstrates that we have inducible control over PETase expression.After constructing our PETase-sfGFP fusion plasmids and demonstrating we had inducible control PETase expression via sfGFP visualization, SDS Page and Western Blot, we were ready to test whether the PETase-sfGFP construct catalytically active.At 30 kD, we see a band which corresponds to the approximate expected size of PETase (28.6 kD).After the voltage of D. tsuruhatensis in the presence of methylene blue and M9 plateaued, we injected terephthalic acid into the mix.From the original paper published on PETase1 we knew that the PETase could be catalytically active in our chassis organism E. coli, but we didn\u0092t know whether the upgrades we made to the system would interfere with the catalytic activity.To show that any change in absorption was due to PETase-sfGFP fluorescence rather than other artifacts of the cell lysate, an uninduced control was run with pNPB substrate.Cells were induced with 0.4M, 0.1M, or 0M IPTG for either 6 hours or overnight, at either 15 or 30 degrees C. After expression, cells were then lysed according to our ultrasonication protocol, and supernatant and pellet were collected for the SDS Page gel.While the SDS page can show a protein of the proper size is being expressed, a Western allows us to probe the identity of protein itself.Before performing the SDS Page we grew up T7 lysY Iq cells containing a plasmid with PETase under control of the T7 promoter.Our final step in showing that we can produce an electrical signal from TPA was to demonstrate a voltage surge in an actual microbial fuel cell using D. tsuruhatensis, methylene blue, and terephthalic acid.To this end, we reached out to Parley for the Oceans, an organization dedicated to tackling threats to our oceans.The background is absorbance is likely due to the sfGFP fusion, which typically emits most strongly at a different wavelength but would also absorb some at 405nm.Lysozyme was run as a control, which you can see has a dark band in the same location.Below are our results:Induced PETase-sfGFP fusion is catalytically active.PETase fused to GFP is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate over time.Cells were lysed, and triplicates of induced culture lysate were mixed with pNPB substrate or the same lysis buffer they were already in.Without inducer, otherwise identical cell lysate has low absorbance as it is not expressing PETase or the GFP tag (brown).This experiment again demonstrates our system\u0092s inducible control: the blue box shows there is no band in the absence of IPTG.Upon the addition of PNPB substrate, absorbance increases (pink trend) suggesting that PETase is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate.For the SDS Page protocol, please refer to our experiments page.Likewise, the substrate by itself has low absorbance (blue).Our results indicate that PETase-sfGFP has background absorbance without the pNPB substrate, but that with the pNPB substrate absorbance increases, showing that PETase-sfGFP is able to catalyze pNPB into 4-nitrophenol which will absorb at this wavelength.We put either methylene blue or neutral red into a plate reader with the E. Coli overnight to observe which condition would result in the largest reduction of methylene blue or neutral red.As shown in the graph below, D. tsuruhatensis with M9 (medium with no carbon source) didn\u0092t grow as well as D. tsuruhatensis with M9 and TPA.To control for the background absorption of pNPB, just the substrate was also run.To make PETase easily detectable via Western Blot, we designed our constructs to include a \u0093His tag\u0094 which is targeted by a commercially available antibody.We hypothesize this is because the PETase GFP fusion is being degraded by proteases because it is so large.PETase has a weight of 24 kDa, so the band is exactly where we would expect to see PETase.After contacting Parley, we were redirected to their Junior Project Manager, Lisa Gran, who sent us 10g of \u0093mixed raw plastic\u0094 from the organization\u0092s most recent beach cleanup.In the control that has not been induced (0M IPTG), we do not observe a band between 20 and 25 kDa.In our induced sample, we observed sfGFP fluorescence at a magnification of 100x.The image below shows that the best exogenous mediator type and concentration is methylene blue at 0.005.Delftia tsuruhatensis, Methylene Blue and TPA in Microbial Fuel Cell: Voltage over timeOur team achieved our objectives and successfully managed to demonstrate PETase enzymatic activity in a laboratory setting.Although you can still observe some baseline sfGFP fluorescence, the induced sample is much brighter and has many more cells fluorescing.It is also important that our inducible promoter is truly controlling protein expression and uninduced samples do not produce much PETase.The largest color change would indicate that the bacteria had efficiently reduced the exogenous mediator.We hypothesize the smear we see between 70 kD and 30kD in lane 2 is because of the same phenomenon, such that the PETase-GFP fusion is being chopped into varying length fragments, each which has a histag and therefore shows up on the blot.Future directions of our project would include characterizing degradation of the acquired mixed plastic to simulate a real-world situation and work towards optimizing our system.1Yoshida, Shosuke et al.In the future, our team envisions our enzyme degrading plastic collected directly from the ocean.This band is strongest in lane 1, which contains lysate from our PETase construct that is unfused to GFP and induced with IPTG.By simply shining a UV light on the cell culture, an ocean plastic researcher without synthetic biology experience can determine whether Plastiback is working or not based simply on fluorescence.For a more detailed description, please refer to the project experiments page.D.In particular, the sfGFP fusion we made to allow Plastiback to be easily serviced by ocean researchers might interfere with the enzyme\u0092s active site, for example.On the right is the uninduced sample, also at 100x.The assay, called the p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) substrate assay, demonstrates enzyme activity when the breaking of an ester bond in the substrate produces 4-Nitrophenol.The sfGFP tag produces some absorbance reading which is why the green trend line is not closer to zero.In order to produce an electrical signal from TPA in our MFC, we have to first demonstrate that our bacteria can metabolize TPA.Finally, we see no signal in lane 5, which was lysate from cells containing the same construct as lane 1, but uninduced.Because we wanted to test with a bacteria known to work with exogenous mediators, we ran this preliminary test with E. Coli.By running an SDS-PAGE as described above, we could separate all the proteins in the cell by size.Showing our protein is inducibly expressed: SDS Page and Western blotNext, we can validate protein expression further with SDS Page and Western blot visualization.Our graph below shows that after adding terephthalic acid, the voltage spikes from just below 90mV to around 120mV.The individual specks in the following photo on the left are cells.", "safety": "What opinions do these people have about your project?Our product is intended to be used as a plastic-mapping and plastic-degrading device for ocean researchers and others concerned with the distribution of plastic in the ocean.Future directions of our project are mechanical design solutions to the following important questions: How do we prevent small animals from getting trapped in the device?Will the device stay afloat and be easy to retrieve from the ocean?What happens when it s all used up?On a farm, in a factory, inside human bodies, in the ocean?Because our prototype is meant to be used in the ocean, we envision a bioreactor design that ensures the engineered microbes act as a closed system that is not released into the ocean environment.Lastly, because the Delftia bacteria in the microbial fuel cell is not genetically modified, its escape does not pose a significant risk.If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?Direct benefits of a successful and efficient plastic-sensing system, such as Plastiback, will be felt by researchers looking to map the distribution of plastics in the ocean, who have no alternative to physical sampling.At our current stage of research, we have determined that PETase production exerts a significant metabolic load on our expression cells, making them unlikely to be able to survive in the ocean environment.The influx of plastic will make that difficult, but future directions for research will include solidifying design to prevent engineered microbes from escaping into the ocean environment.Because the ocean surrounds us and touches each of our lives every day, this application will benefit the global community.As part of the prototype stage of our design, we are considering the environmental impact of the product in the oceans.Plastiback also has the added benefit of being able to collect plastic and degrade it, converting these fragments, especially microplastics which otherwise pollute the ocean and interfere with the lifecycles of marine organisms, into electricity.To prevent our engineered microbes from being released into the environment, we followed our host lab\u0092s guidelines for proper disposal of organic waste.Parley for the Oceans also sent us a typical sample of ocean plastic.Estimates of plastic in the ocean are currently derived from surveys by research crews hauling nets through the ocean and hand-counting pieces of plastic3.This included appropriate clothing, covered shoes, lab coats, goggles, and disposable gloves.When choosing bacteria to use in our microbial fuel cell for their special ability to degrade Terephthalic Acid(TPA), a by-product of PET plastic degradation, we were careful to select only BSL1 organisms.\u0093Bottles, Bags, Ropes and Toothbrushes: The Struggle to Track Ocean Plastics.\u0094 Nature 536.7616 (2016): 263\u0096265.When working with such chemicals, we were careful to only work under the fume hood.This being said, our future work includes testing bioengineered control mechanisms such as a kill switch or synthetic amino-acid dependency 2 to make the risk of escape and proliferation in the environment even smaller.Considering the implications of synthetic biology tools to the world beyond the lab, It is important to maintain safe and ethical use of engineered organisms.We transported materials between our lab and the Northeastern team\u0092s lab in sealed containment to prevent release.To prevent exposure, we wore basic personal protective equipment in the lab at all times.Plastiback\u0092s contribution to ocean plastic research will affect how well the effects of plastic pollution are

abilities and the fact that it is a new discovered protein inspired us to work with UnaG.As part of this iGEM project, research has been done on the newly discovered green fluorescent protein called UnaG.This is the first fluorescent protein to be found in a vertebrate species, giving it a range of biochemical properties that differs from proteins found in the original FP family - one of the most astounding ones being that fluorescence occurs only when a ligand binds non-covalently to the protein, namely bilirubin.Induction of fluorescence of UnaG by the addition of bilirubin.Instead of binding a fatty acid molecule, the ligand of UnaG is bilirubin, which binds non-covalently to the center of this \u00df barrel.During the summer we created three different UnaG biobricks; one with a hexahistidine tag suitable for affinity chromatography, one with the hexahistidine tag and a flexible linker of six amino acids suitable for fusing to other proteins, and lastly one biobrick with only the flexible linker attached to UnaG.This feature could make UnaG suitable as an inducible marker by the addition and removal of bilirubin to cells.In addition to the affinity tag, the original sequence was also modified to include C-terminal flexible linker (GSG)2 in case the protein would be part of a fusion construct.Secondly, it fluoresces only when a bilirubin molecule is bound non-covalently to the protein.The binding buffer for UnaG contains 10 mM imidazole, the washing buffer (to remove the excess protein from the column) contains 20 mM imidazole and the elution buffer contains 350 mM imidazole.This does not interfere with 3A assembly, but a variant of the BioBrick without the flexible linker also exists.IDT sequenced the entire pUCIDT-Amp vector including the ordered insert as part of their quality control workflow, so their results were used as a reference when doing modification to the plasmid.The IDT plasmid contains the lac-promoter so it is possible to do test expression directly with IPTG.UnaG has shown the ability of being fused to other proteins via a flexible linker both on the C terminus and the N terminus, making it suitable to use as a fusion marker.At each step of the experiments, sequencing was performed using the iGEM standard VF2 and VR verification primers to ensure CDS integrity and especially to avoid introduced frameshift mutations.In addition to mutagenesis experiments, small-scale expression tests were performed to verify that UnaG expresses under our laboratory conditions (Kumagai et.al (2013) purified and crystalized the protein from E.coli, so in theory it should be functional in prokaryotes).In the original paper (Kumagai et al., 2013) the authors obtained the UnaG sequence from a cDNA library of unagi eel muscle.The result of the degradation are two toxic compounds; carbon monoxide (CO) and the bilirubin, were as it is only the carbon monoxide that is possible for the body to excrete easily (Mugnoli et al.The pigment also has the ability to conjugate with three types of proteins that are involved in the transport and the metabolism of bilirubin in vivo (Bonnett et al.In addition, none of the fractions fluoresced when bilirubin was added.Since sequencing confirmed that there are no mutations, and we previously managed to obtain impure functioning UnaG during the small-scale experiments of UnaG, the conclusion was that the IPTG solution was faulty and did not manage to induce the T7 promoter driven UnaG expression.Moreover, unlike all other fluorescent proteins of today, UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, meaning that it can be used as a marker protein in research under hypoxic conditions.1976).Hyperbilirubinemia, also called Jaundice disease or icterus (www.mesh.kib.ki.se), occurs when either the formation of bilirubin glucuronides or the excretion of these does not work in the correct manner.After successfully obtaining UnaG assembled with a variety of promoters, mutagenesis was performed in order to create several variants of the BioBrick for future use.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0140972 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco) created by the enzymatic reaction of haemoglobin degradation.There is a slight blue shift in the fluorescence (UnaG is 498/527 nm ex/em and Chlopsid FPI and FPII 489/523 nm ex/em).These contains two glucuronic acids per bilirubin molecule and the compound seems to simply be an effect of bilirubin\u0092s three dimensional structure.One chain of glucuronic acid is enough to make the bilirubin excretable, but diglucoronides can also occur in the human bile.However due to the way the final product is created, the UnaG sequence had a 50% chance to be incorporated in reverse, which was the case.(I)Since UnaG was discovered fairly recently, no mutagenic variations of the protein have been developed with improved characteristics than those of wtUnaG.Consequently the concentration of bilirubin and glucuronic acid accumulates in the body (Buchan, 1826).After the column is equilibrated with ion binding buffer, the buffer it switched out with 0.3 M NiSO4 and a new equilibration step is made with 5 CV\u0092s of ion solution.According to Akiko Kumagai and his team, the quantum yield of holo-UnaG is 0.51 and it is stable in a pH ranging from 4 to 11 (I).UnaG does not seem to be present in any of the fractions 1-7.Afterwards 5 CV of wash buffer is pumped through to remove of all the excess protein still in the column.UnaG is a fluorescent protein that was recently discovered in eel muscle (Anguilla japonica).Since the glucoronic acid contains several COOH- and OH-groups the bilirubin conjugate becomes more hydrophilic than the bilirubin alone.The column is equilibrated with 5 CV of binding buffer, afterward 25 ml of the binding buffer is mixed with the UnaG lysate and loaded onto the column.The researchers suggest that this blue shift stems from the fact that the 57th amino acid in UnaG is asparagine, whereas Chlopsid FPI and FPII contain a histidine at this site.Bilirubin exists in all vertebrates and is a metabolite of the heme group in hemoglobin.Annotations: 2_3F - UnaG under a strong constitutive promoter BBa_K880005 + bilirubin1_5M - GFP under a medium constitutive promoter BBa_K608011 (control)RFP - pSB1C3

PBS - phosphate-buffered saline solution with lysozyme (control)bilirubin - 1mM bilirubin solution in DMSO (control)After observing the small-scale expression results, plans for large-scale purification were designed.All of the fractions were then tested for the target protein using SDS-PAGE.Common properties for these compounds, among which bilirubin is included, is that they can diffuse through biological membranes in the placenta, blood brain barrier and hepatocytes.After centrifugation at 4\u00b0C and 10 000 g for 1 hour, the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 \u00b5M pore filter and loaded to a Ni2+ affinity column, also called IMAC.Alignment of the DNA sequences of UnaG and the Chlopsid proteins show 54% homology.In fact, BR is the actual fluorophore of UnaG.This part has been designed for studying the properties of the protein in vivo, since the high positive charge of the affinity tag could interfere with its function or localization.Upstream of it lies a 6xHis affinity tag, separated by an additional Serine amino acid to increase flexibility between the tag and the protein.When BR binds to the cavity of the protein, it emits green light at 527 nm.Since the haemoglobin is located inside the red blood cells, the protein is hidden from the catabolism.Downstream of the part lies a short Glycine-rich flexible linker to minimize the effects of possible protein fusion.(2015) Adaptive Evolution of Eel Fluorescent Proteins from Fatty Acid Binding Proteins Produces Bright Fluorescence in the Marine Environment.This is part retains all the features, including the RFC25 prefix and suffix, but now the flexible linker is properly expressed and in case of fusing to another CDS would not cause premature termination.Finally, to avoid potential interference from the 6xHistidine affinity tag, BBa_K2003012 was created based on BBa_K2003011.After staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destaining, the band corresponding to UnaG\u0092s expected size (15.6 kDa) was not observed anywhere.The isolation and characterization of bilirubin diglucuronide, the major bilirubin conjugate in dog and human bile.These cool features, alongside the fact that it is always exciting to work with new discoveries, made us want to add this protein to the iGEM toolbox!The UnaG sequence itself was excised from the IDT plasmid using EcoRI and PstI and ligated into pSB1C3 backbone cut with the same set of enzymes.(I)UnaG is a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP).Thereby it becomes possible for the bilirubin to leave the liver and go along with the bile, through the kidneys and then finally get excreted with the urine.In this part, the six amino acids were removed (again through PCR), as well as the Serine linker in between.is almost never present (if so the molecule would have been directly polar and lipophilic) (Mugnoli et al.An exception is an NsiI site in the N-terminal 6xHis tag, but a BioBrick without it was also made.The human being\u00b4s survival is dependent on the monoglucuronides, but not on the diglucuronides (Gordon et al.This protein is interesting firstly because it is about half the size of other fluorescent proteins that are being used today, making it suitable as a fusion protein.In the registry it is annotated as BBa_K2003010.It is only when the exchange into new red blood cells takes its place that the haemoglobin becomes exposed and decomposed by either fagocytosis or haemolysis.1985).Bilirubin is naturally excreted in the liver by, with the help of enzymes, conjugating with the sugar glucoronic acid to create glucuronides.The structure of bilirubin.Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.The molecule has a tendency to form several derivate of bilirubin such as biliproteins, several conjugates and glucuronides etc (Harris, Kellermeyer, 1970).The results verify that UnaG does not fluoresce in absence of bilirubin.Afterwards the column had to be charged with Ni2+ this is done with a ion binding buffer (50 mM Na+CH3COO-, 300 mM NaCl, pH4).This discovery suggests possibilities of changing the emission wavelength of these proteins by mutagenesis comparableto what has been done on GFP for the past 40 years.They contribute to the transport of lipophilic compounds, often fatty acids.To avoid unspecific fluorescence, cell debris were pelleted before the experiment and small aliquots of the supernatant were added to 200 \u00b5L thin-walled PCR tubes.Figure 1.No other fluorescent protein has a ligand that binds non-covalently to it.Therefore suites of different BioBrick promoters were extracted from the 2016 distribution to test for expression.No indications that the diglucuronides are more biological efficient have been noticed so far.It originates from the muscle fibers of the Japanese Unagi eel Anguilla japonica.Even at the pH-values where the COOH-group is in an ionic state the formation of Figure 1C is predominant.In these forms the pigment creates several hydrogen bonds between the NH/O-groups and OH/-groups, which in turn makes the hydrophilic COOH- and NH-groups not available for polar interaction with their environment.The bilirubin molecules have a tendency to create different complexes with other proteins as well, such as serum albumin.Bilirubin does not exist naturally in lower classes of organisms such as bacteria and yeast, so it would have to be added exogenously when research is being done on these types of cells.Bilirubin can only bind to UnaG in its unconjugated (4Z,15Z) form, meaning that wild-type UnaG shows high specificity to this particular molecule.Comparison in different species of biliary bilirubin-IX? conjugates with the activities of hepatic and renal bilirubin-IX?-uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases.The Effect of pH on Green Fluorescent Protein: a Breef Review.The bilirubin is difficult to excrete since it is a non-polar compound and therefor not soluble in water (Fevery, J et al.High levels of bilirubin are toxic and it can result in neurologic harm that causes deafness, delayed development and cerebral pares (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco).UnaG is a \u00df barrel structure containing eleven \u00df strands - a typical quality for FABPs.Consequently the bilirubin becomes insoluble in water and methanol, but easy to dissolve in chloroform (Mugnoli et al.Chlopsid FPI and FPII are also bilirubin inducible.Note that this part is designed with RFC25 (Freiburg Standard) prefix and suffix in mind, hence it contains additional restriction sites, that do not affect normal 3A assembly but enable in-frame protein fusion without creating stop codons.is present when bilirubin is in liquid and solid constellations (Le Bas, Allegret, et al.Structure of bilirubin IX? (isopropylammonium salt) chloroform solvate, C33H34N4O62?.2C3H10N+.2CHCl3.Acta Crystallographica Section C Crystal Structure Communications,39(9), 1287-1291. doi:10.1107/S0108270183008252Karolinska institutet, https://mesh.kib.ki.se/term/D007567/jaundice-neonatal, Retreived 2016-08-11.Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco.Bilirubin is not very soluble in water, so the stock 1mM solution was prepared in DMSO instead.Breaking open the cells was performed using Qsonica Q700 titanium-tip sonicator since lysozyme has nearly the same size as UnaG and would make purification more difficult, as well as just slower and less efficient compared to sonication.Kumagai, A., Ando, R., Miyatake, H., Greimel, P., Kobayashi, T., Hirabayashi, Y., Shimogori, T., and Miyawaki, A.UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, making it suitable for research executed under anaerobic conditions where FPs are not functional.(III)(I) Kumagai, A. Ando, R. Miyatake, H. Greimel, P. Kobayashi, T. Hirabayashi, Y. Shimogori, T. Miyawaki, A.Those include a medium constitutive promoter (BBa_K608006), a strong constitutive promoter (BBa_K880005), IPTG inducible promoter (BBa_J04500), and a T7 promoter (BBa_K525998).", "design": "The feature area is where channels can be placed and is the part of the design which will actually be translated into a PDMS chip.The total running length of the heat shock channel is 2.276 cm and the part of the heating channel which runs parallel with the heat shock channel is 1.41 cm.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the electroporation chip.However there were still some problems with warping (about one out of four turned out to be good), so we went back to the drawing board to create our finalized design.The basic design is a box which is 2.2x3.3x2.5 cm.The heat shock channel itself is 300 \u00b5m wide at its thin part and 800 \u00b5m wide at the broader parts, it is 500 \u00b5m high in all parts.Early in the summer it was decided that we would primarily work toward creating a functional chip for heat shock, and if there was time to make a electroporation chip and design an incubation feature/chip.The running channels in the electroporation chip are 200 \u00b5m across and 100 \u00b5m high, while the \u0093channels\u0094 where the electrodes are supposed to be placed are 200x200 \u00b5m.The electroporation chip was designed, printed and assembled but there was not enough time to test the transformation capabilities of the design, mainly due to difficulties in getting the electroporation electrodes firmly and correctly attached to the chip.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the heat shock chip.A schematic view of the heat shock chip can be seen in Figure 2.The feature area is 1.6x3.0 cm on the finalized designs.The inlet channel for the cell suspension is 500 \u00b5m wide and 100 \u00b5m high.Size-wise, these were about 2/3rds of the chip in Fig.This design paradigm was quickly scrapped mainly due to the moulds (and therefore the chips) easily becoming warped during the curing process.The chip in Figure 1 is about 7x3 cm (slightly larger than a microscrope slide).Figure 1: Early design: Easily made and easily warped.Smaller, thicker rectangles.We went over several iterations of designs until we settled on the box designs.The resistor which we added is theorized to produce longer and larger droplets, since these scale with the length of the outlet channel.The total distance that the liquid travels inside the resistor is 103.4 mm or about 10 cm.", "human_practice": "To make an example this manual is made specifically for heat shock transformation, but the design of the chip can be altered to fit any other purpose.When we wrote the manual we wanted it to fit the needs of smaller laboratories that might lack all the necessary equipment and prior knowledge.As a part of Human Practices we decided to develop a manual for manufacturing a microfluidic chip for heat shock transformation.After a short discussion concerning intellegent property and the writing of a contract, our files containing the design of the chip, as well as the manual while it was under progress we re sent to them.The Biohackers at Makerspace are going to test our manual in practice in the near future and we look forward to see the results from our manual and manufacturing method being used.The manual covers the full manufacturing process for a microfluidic chip based on a 3D-printed mold.The collaboration with Makerspace gave us important feedback and lead to an overall improvement of the manual.", "modeling": "The flow rate of the inlets was set to a laminar inflow with average velocity of 10 cm/s and the outlets was set to open.The initial temperature of the whole chip was set 25\u00b0C and the initial value of the velocity field was set to 0 everywhere in the channels.Fig3: Simulation progress after 0.02, 3, 5 and 10 sThe results of modelling the heat shock system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.We decided to model our design for the electroporation chip so that we could test out different designs of the chip and view the effects of changing parameters such as flow rate and channels size.Modeling the heat distribution over time in the heat transformation chip circumventedthe technical problems of measuring the temperature inside the channel which proved to be very complicated due to the small dimensions of the channels and a lack of equipment.The main goal of the model was to determine if the structure we designed would be able to generate droplets with our intended values for the flow rate of a dispersible phase, an oil phase, and a continuous phase, cell solution.In our case, we were not able to measure the exact temperature of the cell channel inside our heat shock chip.To set up the simulation we choose time dependent study and the conjugated heat transfer interface which is used to simulate the coupling between heat transfer and fluid flow.That is, your actual values may not be exactly like those shown in the model but the model can give you a good picture of what is going on inside the chip.For the electroporation model we decided to focus on a liquid/liquid interface system as these are generally easier to model and drew the T-junction in COMSOL and assigned correct materials, PDMS, oil and water.The mesh is necessary because COMSOL uses the finite element method, a numerical approach where the problem is divided into smaller parts, \u0093elements\u0094, to calculate difficult partial differential equation systems.After generating the mesh the initial values and the boundary conditions of the problem was set.This means that higher flow rates require a finer mesh and smaller time step in order for the solver to converge.The results of modeling the electroporation system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.This is a good approximation for viscous fluids.The boundary of the chip to the surrounding was set to a constant temperature of 25\u00b0C andthe boundary condition of the two inlets was set to a constant temperature of 65\u00b0C to simulate a constant inflow of 65\u00b0C water.With the help of a COMSOL simulation, we could see the heat spreading in PDMS.A mesh was generated of the drawn chip using the inbuilt mesh generating feature with the parameters set to physics-controlled mesh and element size finer.For these reasons, models are a good method of acquiring knowledge about the details of your chip, especially the details that are difficult to measure.Finally an outlet was placed at the end of the main channel.One important aspect of designing the heat shock chip was to determine how heat dissipated in the chip.The initial flow rate for both phases was set to 0 as the two phases flow rate are defined under the inlet panel for each channel inlet.The heat equation of the fluid was coupled with the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow.The geometry of the model was built in COMSOL and the domains of the geometry was assigned material specific attributes from the library like heat capacity etc.We focused on modelling the T-junction where the continuous fluid acts on an orthogonal channel with incoming dispersible fluid, leading to droplet generation.In fig 4 the geometry of the t-junction is shown as seen in COMSOL with a blue line representing the initial liquid/liquid interface.Fig4: Geometry of t-junction with initial line liquid/liquid interfaceThe wetting conditions of the walls was set to no slip conditions.The boundary conditions was set to laminar inflow and the average velocity for the continuous phase: 100 nl/min and dispersible phase: 100 nl/min.Droplet formation is thought to occur as a combination of shear stress on the dispersible fluid and a pressure drop when the dispersible fluid droplet has almost filled the entire cross section of the channel.Lastly a \u0093coarser\u0094 mesh was generated with corner refinement around the edges where the orthogonal channel(dispersible phase channel) meets the main channel (continuous phase channel).This was important in order to know if the cells are actually being heat shocked, and at what temperature.By testing a virtual chip system we get both fast and detailed information that is helpful when deciding on the actual parameters of the physical chip.The entrance length can be calculated from the formula 4A/P were A is the cross sectional area of the channel and P the circumference.This method is accurate but also has a high computational cost making it ideal for microfluidics applications where the number of droplets needed to be tracked are few.Generally interface tracking uses a fixed mesh to calculate how the interface changes between two phases.Therefore depending on the interface type, gas/liquid or liquid/liquid, the final model had to be changed to meet the requirement for each type.This structure is critical as the size of the droplets and their flow rate after formation will determine how well the cells is being transformed.It uses the regular heat equation for the heat transfer in solids and the heat equation for fluids that accounts for energy transport due to flow, heat from pressure work and viscous effects that produce fluid heating.The properties for the surface tension was defined by a liquid/liquid system and the library value for the olive oil/water surface tension coefficient was used.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "As a proof of concept we did 2 rounds of experiments on our heat shock chip, one where we compared its transformation efficiency to that of regular heat shock transformation done off-chip and one where we compared transformation efficiency on the chip at different temperatures.During the summer we made over 30 chips and numerous successful heat shock transformations using only 8.4 ng of DNA and 5.9 ?L of competent cells.This waslikely due to the primitive and direct way cells were fed into and out of the chip (usinga syringe to push in/out cells and eye-measuring to see whether cells have entered thechip makes for inaccurate timing and a lot of back and forth).For each transformation at a set temperature the amount of formed colonies can be viewed in figure 3.The average (avg) number of colonies at each temperature drops slightly when going from 55 ?C, 65 ?C to 75 ?C since the latter two contain replicates with zero number of colonies.The avg value for the number of colonies at each temperature was used to determine the average transformation efficiency, represented by the cfu/\u00b5g value and is presented in Table 3.We found that the transformation efficiency was much higher in the conventional heat shock than on our chip.There was also very high variation in the transformation efficiency among the experiments done on on the chip(which were done using similar/identical reagents).Figure 3 shows the data points for the triplicates at each temperature having a large spread of the amount of formed colonies.That is, two transformations carried out on the chip in the same manner could yield a varying number of colonies.The cleanliness of our chip was good as little to no colonies grew on the plates with only SOB run through the chip nor on the plates with only cells (negative control).The plates with bacteria transformed on the chip showed many colonies, considering the small amount of cells and DNA that were plated.On a per plate basis the highest efficiency we had was123 000 and the lowest was 0 (8 out of 50 plates had 0 colonies), with the averageseveral potential causes which could cause this large variation of results.Variation could be due to human error.Here the raw data of every transformation is presented alongside the comparison transformations we did.According to the results presented in Table 1 and Table 2 the heat shock chipdid not reach higher efficiency than conventional methods, at least with the comparison metrics used.The crosses represent each replicate, the circle is a contamination check, and the rhombs are the average amount of colonies at each temperature.The highest average value for formed colonies was at 55 ?C for the heating fluid, giving 30 colonies whilst heat shocking at 65 ?C and 75 ?C yielded 21 and 14.7 colonies.In other words, the transformation worked on our chip and it greatly reduced the amount of reagents needed since colony growth was observed on plates were only 6mL of cell/DNA suspension was heat shocked.The setupof the chip involved running heated water from a beaker through the chip and thismeans that there can be a chance that there is higher or lower thermal leakage thanexpected, leading to the transformation efficiency being affected.55 ?C showed formed colonies for each of the three replicates.Figure 3.Mean transformation efficiencies of the different chips (1-3) and conventional transformations (0).Number of colonies formed after transformation at each temperature.Calculations of colony forming units per microliter DNA were made and the mean for each chip is shown in Figure 1.", "safety": "Besides following standard laboratory safety procedures (gloves, glasses, laboratory coat) we also did the majority of our work in a fume hood or in a \u0093clean corner\u0094.Still we maintained good lab etiquette and treated it with similar safety precaution as we did with E. coli.Acrylamide - The gel used for SDS-PAGE is made from an acrylamide solution.Cured PDMS is also non-toxic and does not have any specific flammability.Chloroform - Chloroform was used for cleaning PDMS, glass/plexiglass slides and the chip molds, especially directly after receiving the molds or directly after a curing of a new chip.To keep bottles of growth media sterile, we used gas burners on the bench.Since chloroform can melt vinyl gloves to the skin we used nitrile gloves when handling it.Whenever liquid nitrogen was used, we made sure to use safety goggles, insulating gloves and worked in a well ventilated area.Nickel Sepharose Fast Flow - Resin used for IMAC loaded with Ni2+ ions is flammable.During work with liquid PDMS we always worked in a fume hood, except when we put the mold inside the laboratory oven.Furthermore we always left all chemicals related to the creating and curing of the chips inside the fume hood, to prevent any gas leaks to the rest of the laboratory.CRISPR systems as Cas9 and CPF1 have the ability to digest DNA, making them a possible mutagen.As a final safety precaution we blasted our guide RNAs against the human genome before we synthesised them, choosing only sequences that had low or no homology.The gas burners were also used to sterilize loops for streaking bacteria and to sterilize glassware at the bench.We used the E. coli strains DH5?, MG1655, BL21(DE3).Even if non-pathogenic organisms are used, some of the reagents can be harmful for humans and the environment.Chief among these were ethanol and 2-propanol, but we also used chloroform during some parts of the summer.Since liquid nitrogen expands a lot when it boils, a special thermos has to be used to ensure that gaseous nitrogen can escape.Before starting the work in the lab, the whole team attended a safety demonstration regarding the lab and lab work.Gloves should always be worn when working with SYBR safe.Liquid nitrogen - We used liquid nitrogen to snap freeze our freshly made competent cells before placing them in a -70? freezer.It should always be handled in a fume hood using nitrile gloves.SYBR Safe - This compound is used to stain the DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis.It is however very unlikely to affect humans (or any eukaryote) as the protein would have to get into the nucleus.The booklet \u0093Common sense for laboratory work\u0094 by IBG, Uppsala University was available in the lab for quick referencing.However protective glasses, gloves and lab coat should always be worn since PDMS is very sticky and can easily stick to clothes or skin, where it is hard to remove and poses a moderate eye hazard.If CPF1 would end up in the cytoplasma, it would then have to be transported into the nuclei for it to be able to cut in the genome.That way, even if CPF1 was imported into our cells and then into the nucleus, it would have no nuclease activity.When possible we forwent the use of chloroform in favor of using 2-propanol or ethanol.During work with microfluidics we used some chemicals for cleaning PDMS, mold, plexiglass and glass slides prior to usage.A lab technician was available during the weeks for further support and questions.The protein would have to be transported over the cell membrane.Working in a lab involves many safety concerns.When handling the organisms, we wore lab coats and gloves when needed.While it is much less toxic and a less potent mutagen than Ethylium bromide, it is by no means completely safe to work with.Since not all team members had previously worked with bacteria or other microorganisms, the more experienced team members taught the others proper sterile technique and how to handle biological samples.", "keywords": "TAT-Apoptin antibiotics mechanical encryption calcitonin LC-Cutinase fusicoccin tetracycline controlled polystyrene", "track": "Hardware", "part_favorite": "",
