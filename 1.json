"Secondly, we knew more supportive policies on the new environmental technology, and to know that the application of the genetic engineering in the disposal of pollution will not contradict the related laws gives us more confidence about our project.Overall, the heavy metal pollution of Chinese offshore cannot be overlook when we use seawater as material.In normal desalination process, even normal resource water has to go through some sedimentation processes.As to the opinion on the treatment of industrial polluted water, most respondents are unsatisfied and concerned about it since lots of problems still exist.In this part, we investigated the knowledge of heavy metal contamination and the knowledge of biological approaches dealing with heavy metals.So there is no need or trend to have the heavy metal pollution in a more detailed or specific legislation.In the second aspect, we questioned the supportive policies on new environmental technologies from the national and local government.Firstly, we obtained more legal knowledge about the pollution of heavy metals and water pollution, and thus we have a much clearer concept of the current legal situation in China.Many factories utilized the microorganisms to extract and purify precious heavy metal from the tailings.During the interview, Dr. Tang also asked us about the state of the metal that we retrieve as well as the adaptability of our bacteria.Also, there is a sum of considerable fund specifically supporting the circular economy from the government which we can take advantage of.In the third aspect, we demonstrated our concerns about the disadvantage of biological methods when dealing with the environmental pollution.Companies are optimistic about new technologies because not only are they beneficial for the company itself, the government encourages the development of new technology as well.In the end, Dr. Tang said that our project was aiming at a practical problem in our society and that we should improve the accuracy of heavy metal adsorption.And it offers an optimistic background to the development of new environmental technologies.In view of the fact that our project\u0092s target is pollution control and recycling, Mr. Wu gave us more advice on how to use policies and funds to support our project.We also propagated our project among the pupils and their parents to know about different opinions.After the activity, we interviewed the organizer of the environmental group and learned a lot about the environmental groups and development of sewage disposal in China.This also means that the factories can\u0092t avoid to deal with different pollutions in costal seawater, including heavy metal pollution.No doubt that it could be a promotion both for our project and the application of synthetic biology on environmental issues.On 4th August, we visited the BRUMP recycling technology corporation in Hunan Province.He explained that the heavy metal pollution is a cross-field pollution, so it can be cataloged into atmosphere, water or soil pollution so as to have a hierarchical supervision.Respondents reflect that the information is extremely limited and wish to learn more about heavy metal pollution.In a word, from the statistics above, both the resource and the number of respondents ensure that our survey is of convincing credit.There is a lack of useful and convincing information about the treatment of pollution.Therefore the first problem that we meet with is related to the living conditions of our chassis.In this concept, seawater desalination combing heavy-metal recycling will be the key to build the heavy metal\u0092s balance.The origin of heavy metal comes from the river, therefore, it is hard to control from the origin.Last but not least, we are inspired by the idea to expand our project to the disposal of soil pollution.During the visit, we interviewed with Dr. Tang, the adviser of the company about our project as well as the development of the sewage disposal enterprises.The advantage of our idea is that we only need to make sure that our engineered B. subtilis can survive in sea water while the low efficiency problem is also inevitable.Thirdly, we got information about the policies\u0092 support to industrialize our project.Furthermore, we will be dedicated to spread the scientific and objective attitude towards the transgenic technology to the people around in the future, since the more rebuttal there is, the clearer the truth becomes.2.NGO ( Non-governmental organization ): Leader of an environmental group in NanjingThere are many environmental groups which are devoted to environmental protection in Nanjing.Because of the serious pollution caused by heavy metals in these years, it is hard to make more detailed and revised laws in a short time, but the judicial interpretation has been able to greatly strengthen the enforcement of the standard.On the second problem about the further legislation, the attitude of Mr. Wu is negative.Nanjing-China team will explain the details which needs to be discussed to make this working for real.First, we start with the features of seawater and the end purpose of the combination project.Therefore, on July 3rd, 2015, we interviewed with the expert Mr. Cigang Yu, the research assistant from the research center for nature conservation and biodiversity, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People\u0092s Republic of China (NIES).Furthermore, he inspired us to use the biological methods to cope with soil pollution.At the end of the interview, Mr. Wu highly complimented our project and our in-depth thought on the law and policy issues of the project.In fact, one of the safety concern of general seawater desalination is what do we do with those sediments.Secondly, companies also pay a lot attention to whether the technology can cause pollution to the environment.He mentioned that these two problems are pivotal for the further development of our project.We have also shown to him our iGEM project as well as the iGEM competition.Also, the offshore is relatively big water body which makes the pollution hard to increase as well as decrease.", "modeling": "Using matlab, we can solve technical computing problems much faster.Matlab has a wide range of applications, including signal and image processing, communications, control design, test and measurement, financial modeling and analysis, and computational biology.In our modeling, we use matlab to find out the influences imposed on protein expression by certain parameters, such as pH, ion concentration, etc.Our project uses Bacillus subtilis as the bioreactor to deal with heavy metals: Au, Pb and U.In the first part, we worked out growth curves of B. subtilis\u0091s vegetative state and spore state, using Logistic model.In the third part, we used GolB-Au as an example to shed light on the optimal concentration of metal ions and the time for binding proteins\u0092 saturation.Through modeling, we know B. subtilis better and find optimal experimental conditions.Therefore, optimal PH for growth is 7.0.Combining the experimental data with modelling, we found that sucrose is the best carbon resource for the high growth rate and maximum cell number.Combining the experimental data with modelling, we found that using corn flour as the nitrogen resource contributes to a high growth rate of bacillus subtilis, while yeast cream yields to the maximum in cell number.In the modeling part, we have built three models: Growth, Transcription-Translation and Bioabsorption.Besides, we can also find out whether our wet lab results conform to the modeling results.Considering the fact that proliferation is unhindered when resources are sufficient and minimal when resources have run out, our model couples growth (N) with resources (R).According to the results of modeling, you may predict what would happen under different conditions.Modeling also takes different forms, and the following is some examples of models:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This model is used widely.Modeling aims to build and use a model which provides a theoretical way to explain a phenomenon in a simpler fashion than the real situation.According to the previous research, PH and the resources play crucial roles on the growth of bacillus subtilis.In the second part, we compared the efficiency of three different promoters we use: Pveg, Ptas and Pcot and try to find which one has the highest efficiency.In spore state, bacillus subtilis is dormant and with strong resistance to the unfavorable conditions.[reference1] Referred to Logistic model, here are our equations.The experiment data shows that the number growth rate increases with PH increase when PH is lower than 7.0, but decreases with PH increase (>7.0).However, modeling plays an increasingly vital role in the research of synthetic biology.", "notebook": "As we have

modify a naturally occurring gene which synthesizes rhamnolipids to make it compatible with Assembly Standard 10 for rhamnosiltransferase 1 complex (rhlAB) gene expression in Escherichia coli for standardized rhamnolipid production.The cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill with rhamnolipids as biosurfactants was too expensive and complicated, therefore impractical for large-scale bioremediation.Rhamnolipids as biosurfactants are important in the remediation of oil spill areas.Standardization of the Rhamnosiltransferase 1 gene complex (rhlAB) into a Biobrick-friendly for rhamnolipid production in E. coli.", "design": "We expect that our new E. coli Rh1AB_BB strain produce more rhamnolipid quantity in less time and in a safer way than the P.aeruginosa bacteria, our control for these bioassay will be the E. coli k12 strain given by iGEM that is the same strain that we used to test our BioBrick platform but without the RhlAB gene sequence.In the end, we'll be able to ligate all the parts together to have one general section that contains the Promoter+RBS+ OUR GENE +Reporter+Terminator as a test plataform of our rhamnosyltransferase 1 BioBrick (Rh1AB_BB)expression in E. coli and EUREKA!Once we have this, we have to mutate the Rhamnosyltransferase 1 gene to eliminate the restriction site of PstI that clashes with the iGEM disposition for design and BioBrick construction that indicates that our gene cannot be cut in any way by the restriction enzymes of the Assembly Standard Protocol 10.We accomplish the construction of test plataform for our coding sequence project, but we have not test the plataform yet for the expression of our rhamnosyltransferase BioBrick (Rh1AB_BB) in E. coli.We design an alternative gene sequence using a multiple site mutagenesis and we also designed three different set of primers (we use the Quick Change Primer design tool from Agilent Technologies), because the base pairs that surround the PstI unwanted sequence were different.Also in the future we want to do biochemical and biological characterization of our experimental platform for rhamnolipid production.Also we isolate the rhlAB gene from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomic DNA, cloned this gene in a plasmid vector pGEMT Easy Vector for its further used in the mutagenesis protocol.In the meantime, we have to obtain our gene from the P. aeruginosa.We did this by identifying that the PstI restriction enzyme cut our gene sequence in three parts.The biological characterization will be performed by a comparative bioassay experiment between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and our new E. coli Rh1AB_BB strain.In the future experiments we will do different tests to ensure that the expected rhamnolipid is being produce.Part 3: Results \rWe were able to standardize the BioBrick extraction procedures and assembly of the parts once they were ready.Once each of the parts were obtained, we were able to ligate them together (promoter + RBS and reporter + terminator) and this was confirmed by performing several gel electrophoresis.Project Details\rThe Experiment \rThe purpose behind our project is to take a gene that produces the Rhamnosyltransferase 1 enzyme in a pathogenic bacteria known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and insert it into an efficient and not so pathogenic bacteria that is Escherichia coli.This will help biosynthezise a rhamnolipid that can aid in the more efficent degradation of hydrocarbons.In the natural rhlA is found an illegal site located at the 821 to 823 base pair corresponding to the codon TGC.In the natural rhlB is found two illegal sites, the first located at the 1843 to 1845 base pair corresponding to the codon CTG and the second illegal site located at the 1957 to 1959 base pair corresponding to the codon CTG.We follow the manufacturer guidelines for the primer design.This bacteria was a kind donation from Marcelino Gutierrez, Ph.D, who is a researcher from the Drug

conceptual framework to perform a interpretative translation into a more colloquial language directed to the whole civil society, and which allows the latter to acquire its own opinion and to make point of views and clearly defined decisions related to various bioethical and legal matters within Synthetic Biology field.Activities As a part of Human Practices Project, we develop the following activities: \rDevelopment of a Survey and interviews related to different subjects linked to the new field of Synthetic Biology in our country.Awarded\rThe poster was awarded with the laureate

Biology Human Practices Poster at APANAC \rSYNTHETIC BIOLOGY PROMOTION CAMPAIGN WITHIN SOCIETY\rTelevision documentaries about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition have been done as part of promotion of this knowledge to the widest sector of the population as possible.HUMAN PRACTICE \rSociety must understand the responsibilities and issues that arise with the development of new scientific and technological knowledge, especially when these are related to the biology and life sciences, as is currently happening in the Synthetic Biology field.Survey \rA survey was designed to adrdress issues related to the iGEM competition, with the aim of understanding the perception and levels of knowledge of our community (expert and non expert population) on the matters of Synthetic Biology.In these debates, the implications and significance of the present and future advances and develop on the matters of this new emerging field, Synthetic Biology, are extensively discussed.This project is focused on addressing the same issues and topics that are being addressed by The Presidential Commission chaired by Amy Gutmann for the Study of Bioethical Issues, established by the U.S. government president Barack Obama in November 24, 2009.This commission is addressing issues such as the announcement of the Venter Institute on the creation of the first bacteria with synthetic DNA in July of this year We must do and ask some reflections about our own conception of develop and relation with nature, to respond to these scientific advances.Human Practices Project Objective\rOur project goal is to establish in the Republic of Panama a communication bridge between the whole civil society (including experts and non expert) and Synthetic Biology (SB) developers?? vision.The extraordinary emerging possibilities on the developing of drugs and environmental and public health issues mitigation and remediation that Synthetic Biology can prominently offer, maintaining the premise of having an adequate control for expected results and a supervised legal framework.BIOETHICS:\rA fundamental task of the Human Practices projects has been to develop an extensive review of conceptions and definitions about Synthetic Biology.The poster and presentation exposed by iGEM Panama Team generated a great amount of interest among the concurrent public and the evaluating judges in several Synthetic Biology matters like ??What is Synthetic Biology???, ??Which are Synthetic Biology implications to society?Patent Genetic Material\rWithin iGEM Panama Team 2010, this question had a great opinion division with a 42% of member against the patentability of genetic material vs a 41% in favor (with 17% saying that is too much difficult to answer).How Biology and Engineering approaches get together on the Synthetic Biology Field?See Video of Promotion of iGEM & Synthetic Biology in Panama Public Television [2] \riGEM Panama Team on TVN (Channel 2) News (Spanish) [3] \rSee Fair Pamphlet (Spanish)[4] \rSee poster of APANAC [5] \rSee Newspaper Article [6] \rHUMAN PRACTICES TOPICS RESUME\rThese are the survey results related to our iGEM Panama Team members.Possible risk to human kind\rWithin our team all people answered that there is a true possibility about technological advances can get out of control, and can provoke danger to the environment or the human kind.This work and the results of the iGEM Panama Team application of the survey results were synthesized in one poster that was shown on the XIII National Scientific Congress from the Panamanian Association for Advancement of Science (APANAC), which is the most stable and recognized event in the scientific community in Panama.The principal issues among these can be listed as follows: \rThe unfinished debate about what life is, the conceptual description about natural and artificial, and the profound moral, religious and cultural implications that this kind of debate generates.So, for this reason, we want to end stating that the work operations performed until today were just the first step in the consecution of a new dimension of knowledge in SB, getting better each day to day.Therefore, a similar approach was intended to apply in our country, bringing into the public opinion different conceptions, scientific, philosophical and technical, about this nascent and exciting field of knowledge.The second, is related to the possibility of having an out-of-control incident, how to react to this situation, mitigation procedures and how to avoid these issues.After the revision of these matters, we set the goal of getting deep into the question: Which factual possibility of having an out?Cof?Ccontrol situation there exist within this technological development?Creating Artificial Life\rAbout this question, the majority of the members of the team answered that if we can create artificial life we must do it (46%).Also, we developed an advertising campaign during the National Fair of Scientific and Innovative Young People, a three day event.This survey was first given to the iGEM Panama Team; however, further samplings upon other Panamanian society sector have been taken periodically since that time.Note: In the development of this work the recent debates developed at the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues from the United States of America Government presided by Dra.Also, the cutting edge nature of this project and its potencial for the whole of Panamanian society was remarked and discussed.Translation and conceptual Issues in Spanish\rAs Latin-Americans, it is important to note that the conceptual differences between biosecurity and biosafety, cannot be translated into Spanish in a very accurate fashion, because both terms are commonly translated as 'bioseguridad' (without remarkable definition differences).We are planning to continue doing our job (Survey, interviews, forums, presentations, and so on) on the purpose of

magneticum AMB-1 which will be used as our final chassis.It is based in a glucocorticoid sensor that is able to discern between basal levels and stress levels of glucocorticoid hormones in a sample

cell.GRI: The amount of glucocorticoids inside the yeast cell depends on the degradation rate of the hormone, the complex formation and the import rate of the glucocorticoids inside the cell, which depends on the diffusion rate of the hormone in relation with the concentration of the hormone outside and inside the cell.R: The receptor's production in the cytoplasm is regulated by a constitutive promoter.Nickel removal system As in the Glucocorticoid Sensor project the differential equations were based on the circuit shown in the .Ni: The amount of nickel inside the bacteria depends on the rate at which it enters to the cell by diffusion and by the porines.Once the repressor binds to the nickel it is released and allows the production of the porine.As you can see there are many constants that define the system, so the next step in the mathematical model is to fin those After running the for deterministic model if the Nickel removal system and the parameters found in the literature the results showed that after 15 minutes approximately the system is stable and the bacteria introduced most of the nickel leaving the outside concentration of nickel under the maximum limit of nickel in water:The concentration of this signal will depend on the binding of the complex and the enhancer and its degradation rate.So its concentration on the cell depends on the basal production, the complex production and the degradation rate.Glucocorticoid Sensor Below it is shown differential equations for the glucocorticoid sensor based on the circuit shown in the .This protein binds to the glucocorticoid and forms a dimer.We also consider the degradation rate of the complex and its binding to the signal promoter enhancer.The change in concentration of theses ions only

the tretameric repressor is binded to the promoter.However, before describing the modeled system, it is necessary to know all the symbols that will be used in the documents and the simulation.Then

polluted by MC is in urgent need.After several days\u0092discussion and skipping of many references,we were glad to find that in nature there are several germs can degrade MC efficiently, such as Sphingomonas, P seudomonas and Burkholderia.In addition, MC is very stable and in some extent is very resistant to high temperature and pH change, so it brings the water purification into a very embarrassing situation.Further exploring these germs, we found that their ability to degrade MC is originated from several hydrolases(MlrA?MlrB and MlrC).And the microcystin is the most common one in

"description": "[7]In our project, we focus on degrading a class of PFCs, PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid).Due to strong binding energy of carbon-fluorine bond, these compounds are very difficult to be degraded in nature and they also accumulate in organism, causing harm to the environment and human.Since there\u0092s no regulation for banning PFCs usage and emission in most countries all over the world nowadays, environmental organizations, government and scientists have discovered liquid and volatile PFCs distribution in waters, in snow, in the air, and even in drinking water.Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), including PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooactanesulfonic acid), are hazardous man-made chemicals produced or used in industry and daily necessities.[3] PFOA, one of the most studied PFCs, has been detected in adults' bodies around the world.Mutation Research / Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis Genotoxic potential of the perfluorinated chemicals PFOA , PFOS , PFBS , PFNA and PFHxA in human HepG2 cells.Therefore, we hope to develop an efficient and eco-friendly method to keep the world from PFCs disaster.Our goal is to break carbon-fluorine bonds in PFOA.[7] Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident Cancers among Adults Living Near a Chemical Plant (author: Vaughn Barry, Andrea Winquist, and Kyle Steenland)[8] Ji-Quan Liu,

catfishes and carps in the Yangtze River were found with exceed concentration of PFCs in the liver.[2] In USA, Environmental Working Group (EWG) even showed statistics of PFCs pollution levels in every state.Hence, we assumed that fac-dex is the key to degrading PFOA.In the process breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released.Besides, tons of researches show that PFCs potentially cause diseases to animals and human.High concentration of PFCs have been detected in Pearl River and Yangtze River in China and some lakes in USA since 2007.We also insert a fluoride transporter gene, CRCB[9], to help our modified E.coli survive.There are two goals in our experiment: Degradation of PFOA and transportation of fluoride.What\u0092s worse, researches have suggested that PFOA is link to several disease.Groups of Scientists conducted researches on animals and found that animals which were fed with PFOA, end up with their thymus, spleens, and livers enlarged, possibly tumorous.FA1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens are able to degrade PFOA producing fluoride.[4] Because of its hydrophobicity, PFOA can stay in human body for a long time.", "design": "Meanwhile, escaping engineered bacteria will be killed for biosafety.As for PFOA bioremediation basin, we referred to the structure of current secondary treatment basin and set up a prototyping model.The best way to stop PFOA pollution caused by industrial wastewater is to remove PFOA in the wastewater before it is released into the environment.For the purpose of preventing PFOA from leaking to the enironment, we developed a bioreactor system.We designed a bioreactor and named it \u0093 PFOA bioremediation basin.\u0094 Following is a sketch of our reactor.To develop a more complete bioreactor system, we plan to integrate our own device, PFOA bioremediation basin, into the current industrial wastewater treatment process in the factory producing PFOA wastewater.First, wastewater passes through RO membrane, so that PFOA in the wastewater becomes more concentrated.Once the concentration of PFOA gets higher, the efficiency of our system can be lifted.Next, after some adjustments, such as PH value and temperature, to make the wastewater a proper environment for bacteria to grow, wastewater enters our device, PFOA bioremediation basin.After being processed in PFOA bioremediation basin, wastewater is added with calcium chloride solution of high concentration, so that fluoride, which is the predicted byproduct of PFOA degradation, can be precipitated.In addition, wastewater is set to stay in the basin for a period of time to undergo PFOA degradation performed by engineered bacteria.We apply computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to predict real situation of our project.", "human_practice": "Thanks to their help, we finally finished our provision before we made public at Asia conference in National Cheng Kung University.In the future, we will try to file a corresponding nonprovisional

"result": "Up to 80mM, the growth of E.coli is completely inhibited.First, we cultured the BL21 overnight, and then added IPTG to induce Crcb, Bpe, Fluc expression.Second, we added different concentration of sodium fluoride (NaF) and used ELISA to detect the value of OD 600.We think that if Fluoride transporter work, the bacteria will grow better.Result: Compared with no plasmid control, we found a significant-different with 0.08M and 0.1M [NaF].Based on fluoride-concentration-time graph from sample of modified E.coli (BL21 with Fac-dex) and PFOA of 500 ppm initially, we can tell that the concentration of fluoride increases in time due to the performance of PFOA degradation.With the technic of SDS-PAGE, we can test if our plasmid can be expressed properly in E.coli or not.We separately induced 8 different E.coli culture that had be transformed the Fac-dex gene.From the growth curves, we found that PFOA has little influence on the growth of E.coli.In our experiment, after we transformed our plasmid into E.coli, we induced the expression of Fac-dex gene.After Fac-dex breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released, leading to the increase of fluoride concentration in waterTherefore, by detecting the fluoride concentration with Fluorine Ion Selective Electrode in time, we can know the extent of PFOA degradation by Fac-dex.Then the induced E.coli was transferred into new tube containing LB with different concentration of PFOA (As below).We use same E.coli which hadn\u0092t been induced as the negative control in lane 1.In conclusion, there are extra protein being expressed in the E.coli culture of lane 4, 5, 6, 7.If the gene is able to be induced, there should be a large quantity of Fac-dex existed in E.coli.We used the induced E.coli culture as our samples.BL21 with Fluoride transporter, grew better than control.Conclusion: First, the four figures show that if the environmental fluoride concentration increases, the bacteria which express fluoride transporter can growth better.It manifests that Fac-dex can successfully degrade PFOA and release fluoride.We inoculate starter culture at a 1:100 dilution into LB containing NaF with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.The result is as below?From the growth curve, we know that under 20mM of sodium fluoride, E.coli is able to grow normally.We cultured E.coli in liquid medium (3 ml LB and 5 ml E.coli broth) containing PFOA with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.Under 60mM of sodium fluoride, the growth curve shifted slightly.Our maybe because the amount of our engineered bacteria added in wastewater isn't many enough to work in such amount of wastewater.We also added Mg+2 as the cofactor of Fac-dex.From the result above, the F- released by PFOA degradation is not detectable for PFOA concentration below 100(ppm), 0~12 hours.We induced E.coli culture that had be transformed the Fac-dex gene.So we can't test the fluoride concentrate solely and efficiently.So, we will use Crcb and Fluc to make our bacteria able to tolerate fluoride.We had the wastewater from the origin of factory.", "track":

pump-like systems [3],[4].In recent years many attempts have been made at using microorganisms to create usable mechanical force.", "description": "When the induction of flow was stopped, the bacteria kept the solution flowing with their flagella, in essence acting as a pump.In the article a pump was constructed by coating the inside of a tube with Serratia marcesens.This was done by washing a bacterial suspension through the tube at a speed, that allowed the cells to adhere to the surface.The flow also had the effect of aligning most of the bacteria so their flagella were facing downstream.", "design": "Phototaxis \rRegulation of the pump will be introduced through a synthetic photo-sensing protein that has recently been shown to integrate with the E. coli chemotaxis system [10].Although the cells will be held in place in our system, the part will in effect introduce a phototactic ability to free-moving E. coli.We will also do further characterization of the Cambridge part in new strains of E. coli and with different analytical methods.We also want to be able to regulate the flow that is generated with a light sensor, that integrates into the chemotaxis pathway, giving us very fast response times.Finally for the photosensor to function properly we will need to introduce retinal biosynthesis to the system.Beta-carotene biosynthesis will be supplied by a part made by the 2009 Cambrigde team .Since the chemotaxis system regulates flagellar behaviour, we hope to introduce control of the amount of flow generated with very fast response times since chemotaxis is controlled by phosphorylation cascades rather than transcriptional regulation.Hyperflagellation \rTo achieve hyperflagellation we have decided to focus mainly on increasing the expression of the flhD and flhC transcriptional regulators, also known as the master regulon of flagella synthesis [7].A generator for the enzyme that cleaves beta-carotene to retinal.Retinal biosynthesis \rFor the photoreceptor to work, we will need to supply it with enzymes for retinal biosynthesis.In this way we can avoid altering the buffer solution flowing through the system, this though result in trace amounts of waste products from the cells metabolism.In some hyperflagellated strains, mutations have been found upstream of the regulon that increase expression [9], making the cells hypermotile.Part K274210 was produced and charactarized by the Cambridge 2009 team.A photosensor, reacting to blue light, coupled to the chemotaxis pathway.The turbulence created by the bacteria's flagella will make both liquids move around randomly in the tube, thus causing them to mix.We have decided to take a down-and-dirty approach to increase flagella expression, overriding the regulation alltogether by putting the two genes on a constitutive promotor.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "The dragforce and thereby the force created by the flagellabundle of one E. coli is \r\rThe system we are trying to model consists of a lot of bacteria stuck to a wall, but the part we are interested in is the flagella and the forces they create.We therefore decided to create a model in which the flagella keep still, and one where they are affected by the flow and a potential.The best way to illustrate the result from this model is to see it in action, so below the time series of a system of 20 flagella (only the 4 flagella in the middel of the system is shown), where the elastic constant is zero, is shown: \r\r\r\rIt is clear that the flagella tends to lie down and stabilize in an almost flat position in this case.The above figure shows the average flow velocity as a function of the angle of the flagella.One thing we can do is to consider all the flagella of a bacterium to form one bundle, even though doing so for a bacterium stuck to a wall is questionable.To do this we decided to approximate a flagellum as a string of spheres and use dragforce calculations to figure out the force with which the flowfields of the other flagella would affect the spheres.In the end, this model showed us that in less than 100ns the velocity of the flagella would be the same as the velocity of the fluid when the flagella started with a velocity of zero, after which the two velocities never diverged far from each other.The basis for any model is an understanding of the physical system in question, therefore we will start with a short review of the hydrodynamic properties of flagella and the bacterial pumping system constructed by M. J. Kim and K. S. Breuer [1].Since the flagellum/flagellabundles take on a helical shape, the most accurate thing to do would be to model them as such, but doing this would become quite advanced for even one flagellum, not to mention an entire system.The first thing we had to figure out was how the flow created by all of the other flagella would affect one single flagellum.Figure 6: Shows the mean velocity in the z(perpendicular to the surface) and y(parallel to the surface) direction as a function of the flagella agle, pridicted by the static model.A flagella row on the other wall\rIn our model we settled for placing bacteria on one wall.Several studies [4-5] suggests that the flow created from a single flagellum is highly non-uniform, but to some degree circular symmetric at the end of the flagellum (see figure 2 A and B, below).Simply described, the Oseen-Blake tensor creates a mirror image of our force on the other side of the wall, thus cancelling the flow near the wall (This is not a completely accurate description, but rather an intuitive one).When several flagella rotates counterclockwise, the flagella tend to bundle together in a single helix structure, due to the hydrodynamic interactions [4].When the mean angle was zero corresponding to a vertical flagellum it was pretty much 50-50, but when the start angles were pushed a bit to one side it had a tendency to shift the entire system in that direction.When the flagella come together in a bundle, Floresa, H. et al.Figure 1: Image A shows a shematic picture of the molecular structure of a flagellum [7].[6] suggest that bacteria that are completely fixed to a surface will deviate from the bundle behavior, but it is unclear what happens if the fixation is only partial or if the bacteria are surrounded by a flow.The flowfield created by a pointforce in a fluid with no walls or other obstructions near it can be calculated using the corresponding Green's function known as the stokeslet: \r\rwhere the three indices on G represent the number of walls and their matrix-coordinates, h is the distance between the pointforce and the wall and r is the vector from the pointforce to where the flow is to be calculated.In the following figure we have made many of these runs, but with varying average start-angle \r \r\rFigure 5: Shows the mean end angle as a function of the mean start angle, predicted by the 2D model.In order to create an intermediate situation, we could constrain each flagellum with a harmonic potential, pulling it toward a favored angle (connected to the initial orientation of the fagella when it stick to the surface).It does however offer us the opportunity to investigate at which angle the flow in the tube is highest, which could be helpful when planning how to optimize the use of bacteria as a source of flow.Physical Modelling \rMotivation \rOne of the main ideas in the project is to control the flow induced by a bacterial coating inside a micro-tube.Once you have this vector and the vector corresponding to the force, the flow can be calculated using stokeslet or the Oseen-Blake tensor, depending on whether there is a wall nearby.This means that the tube is so narrow that the forces created by the flagella are not only close to the wall to which the bacteria are stuck, but also close to the opposite wall.All these results refer to flagella moving freely in aqueous solution, the question is now, whether the same is true for bacteria sticking to the surface of a narrow tube?To calculate how big the flow will be at a given point, a vector from the tip of the force-producing flagellum to the point where you wish to know the flow must be created.One way to do this is to create a physical model that describes the most essential features of the system.To know how a flagellum is affected by the flow, the flow at the tip of the flagellum must be calculated.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "Add all of the H2O used in the premix to the PCR tubes and place them

have tried to find a definition for synthetic biology and discussed ethical questions, based on our definition.Initially we need to ask, whether synthetic biology is a new field within the natural sciencesWe hold the opinion, that synthetic biology partly chases new targets, but it is based on many different already existing fields of the natural sciences.We came to the agreement, that synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary branch, which covers different methods as for example, the work with BioBricks.Should we ask ethical questions about our work?If we ask ourselves about the possibility of exploiting those methods and the consequences of exploitation for humanity and nature, it soon became clear, that we need to bother with ethical questions.Ethic is an important aspectAt the beginning of our project, we discussed to what extent our work has consequences for humanity, nature and the industry.The monitoring of the working conditions is an important aspect in this case.Furthermore, during our ethical meetings, we\u0092ve engaged in questions, which exceed our topic, but still have a connection to it.Is genetically modified food without side effects for the people?At first one must fiddle with the structure of the natural substance and the genetic modified substance.On the other hand it is important to enlighten the public about synthetic biology and to improve transparency of genetic engineering.An important question is, whether we destroy the basis of existence for the people, who grow stevia the traditional way, because we could find a procedure which leads to a higher outcome in less time.Due to the fact that the sweetener stevia has just become legalized in November/December 2011 by the European Union and Germany, the annual estimated consumption can\u0092t be determined.It could be possible, that they mix their genetic material with the natural ones, which could again create a new organism.We think, that all these branches constitute the field of synthetic biology, because methods and procedures were first used in those branches.If synthetic biology is just a composition of different already known branches, is it even something new?No, it\u0092s not only a composition.It\u0092s hard to find the beginning and the end of synthetic biology.It is important to show the advantages as well as the disadvantages, to give an understanding of our work.For example it is most dangerous if the work isn\u0092t done hygienic and careful (e.g.If we get the pieces of information, we would like to create an exact comparison next year.Following, the question about the working conditions for the farmers in South America comes up.A solution would be cooperation with Fair Trade organizations, which monitor the working conditions of the farmers in South America and offer their stevia at a fair price in Germany.We still lack the data concerning the quantity which is used here, the pollution done during the transport to Germany and the exact carbon dioxide emission during the microbiological production.To create an exact comparison between the production using yeast and the cultivation in Paraguay, we still would need more pieces of information.Other countries already have many well-known products, which are sweetened with stevia.Another important aspect leads us to the question about environmental consequences.New methods arising from synthetic biology are for example BioBricks, minimal cells, proto cells and customized metabolic pathways.So it is an entirely new branch within the natural sciences?As explained, it\u0092s not entirely new.If it is completely the same on the chemical level, could it really harm the consumer?Another risk factor could be caused by the transfer of eukaryotic genes in prokaryotes, as they have a different mechanism in the mRNA processing or another mRNA structure.A new product with new attributes would be created with an unknown effect on the human body.Another intellectual approach relates to the cultivation of genetic engineered plants.Independently, which way of transportation one uses, the pollution by carbon dioxide is quite high.During the procedure of production

to transform this plasmid into E.coli to get a higher amount of it.After some our we looked for it again and we could see very well the differences between the red and the white colonies.Therefore we made a blunt end ligation to transform the circular plasmid into E.coli.We transformed it into E.coli and made a plasmid preparation.So we now have to check if these BioBrick parts really have no insert.All four proteins show positive results.However we leave all BioBrick parts in the parts registry with the suitable sequences until we have checked our results

grows in M9TY medium for 24 hours at 42? have highest production of isobutanol (~0.75%).However, ethanol will corrode metallic surface of the engines lead to higher cost than fossil fuel usage.Greenhouse Effect and the limitation of the fossil fuels have always been a concern for people on Earth.Due to the pollution issues, this alternative energy should be environmental friendly.According to the previous studies, the low yield of isobutanol was caused by the toxicity of isobutanol which would kill the host E.coli .Up until now, ethanol is the most common biomass fuel because the final product is harmless water.(3)Temperature-controlled RBS was used to control the expression levels of a series of metabolic proteins at the precise times by culture temperature shifts.(2) Five E. coli strains were tested for isobutanol production rate.(4) The fusion protein of a target enzyme and a zinc finger protein was constructed to increase the specificity of chemical reaction.As what we want, to get clean energy, we chose isobutanol to be our project.", "design": "According to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, it would cause a frameshift mutation, which cause the condons code for incorrect amino acid.In order to assemble a production line in E.coli, we have to transform DNA program as well as our fusion protein genes in to E.coli.Besides, our cellulose test result has proven that in our project we are truly able to convert agricultural trash into the precious isobutanol.Overall, we\u0092ve completed our whole project of utilizing glucose to produce isobutanol and reached a production rate which is higher than recently published papers (0.8%=6.4g/L).The first circuit is the one encodes 37? ribosome binding site gene and the second circuit is the one that encodes kivD gene.Now, let us introduce how our system works.Figure 5.The system works in the 37? environment.When being in 37\u00b0C environment, the first circuit will be translated and produce TetR protein to inhibit Ptet promoter.\n)Figure 13.Comparing with the sequence form the part wiki page, there is a missing base (pair) in the zif268 biding site, to be specific a deletion of 25 G. Image: NCBI BLAST.So, we designed a complementary primer to insert the lost base pair.Then, pyruvate will be converted into isobutanol by the enzymes shown in Figure 2.Figure 1.Isobutanol synthesis pathway.Figure 2.We cloned four gene, ilvC, ilvD, AlsS, kivd.According to the previous study, we use four enzymes to catalyze pyruvate to produce isobutanol.The data tells us that kivD enzyme under 37? environment had the lower expression than under 30? and the 25? environment.According to Figure 8, our low temperature release system do truly work !Figure 8.Mark the second circuit with the fluorescent protein to test the expression of kivD enzyme.)Figure 6.The system works in the 30? environment.After having enough of 2-ketoisovalerate , we move E.coli into 30\u00b0C environment.By having this higher concentrated isobutanol, isobutanol purification will be much more favorable to be conducted.The main aim of our \u0093E.coline\u0094 project is to generate isobutanol, a promising eco-fuel, in a productive and efficient way.To produce isobutanol, at first we use four pyruvate catalytic enzyme genes: alsS, ilvC, ilvD, kivD all.Then, we culture the E.coli in 37\u00b0C environment for three hours which means that we put the tank in the warm bath to let E.coli produce the intermediate,2-ketoisovalerate.Besides, we encoded DNA program in the second circuit.Figure 10.The simple picture for zinc finger.Zinc finger proteins contain a DNA binding domain and a functional domain.Furthermore, in order to produce isobutanol more efficiently, we combined zinc fingers and our enzymes together and put the fusion proteins in catalytic pathway order, thus the isobutanol conversion process can be accelerated.To allow E.coli to produce isobutanol efficiently,we introduced the low temperature releasing system (Figure 3.)In the end , we can get the isobutanol efficiently.The design of our biobricks has the same order of zinc finger as 2010 Slovenia iGEM team, so we decided to use their DNA program (BBa_K323066) instead of synthesizing one.Point mutation for correcting DNA programAfter cloning, we sent it to Genomics BioSci & Tech Co., Ltd. for sequencing.Therefore the productivity of isobutanol will be higher.Figure 11.The intermediate and enzyme in the pathway.With this feature, we expected to build a production line to help us make isobutanol.If isobutanol could be transferred from the fermentation flask, we expected the production rate could extend tremendously and the following condensate collector will obtain higher concentration of isobutanol than the previous fermentation flask.As glucose can be catalyzed into pyruvate by glycolysis, we chose glucose as the starting point of our biosynthetic pathway.(3) preliminary distillationAfter incubating the \u0093E.coline\u0094 in 30\u00b0C environment for three days, the concentration of isobutanol is high enough to be collected.The data shows that the higher concentration of the isobutanol was in the medium, the lower OD600 value could be obtained.The accumulated non-toxic intermediate would be converted into the final product , isobutanol.Figure 9.This is the whole circuit in our projectFigure 9 shows the whole circuit of our project.With the zinc finger's 'hand', the enzyme could bind to the specific DNA program.After that, measure the OD600 every 4 hours.We did an experiment to prove the isobutanol is truly toxic to the E.coli.The low temperature system could allow E.coli to produce the optimum production of isobutanol before being poisoned by isobutyaldehyde.Therefore, the second circuit will be translated successfully.The following picture is our system.Figure 3.The idea of our low temperature release system.First, we incubated E.coli in 37\u00b0C environment.(1)37\u00b0CAt the first step, we transformed the plasmid we designed into the E.coli ,and inoculated it in M9 medium- which containing 36 g/L glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract,100 ug/ml ampicillin, 30 ug/ml kanamycin, and 1,000th dilution of Trace Metal Mix A5 (2.86 g H3BO3, 1.81 g MnCl2 ?4H2O, 0.222 g ZnSO4 ?7H2O, 0.39 g Na2MoO4?2H2O, 0.079 g CuSO4?5H2O, 49.4 mg Co(NO3)2?6H2O per liter water)-into the first tank.We pumped air to strip the isobutanol to the flask for product collection.We then designed a temperature control system to allow E.coli to produce optimum isobutanol before being poisoned by isobutyaldehyde.", "human_practice": "They also contributed some interesting ideas during the Q&A time.We answered students\u0092 questions anytime anywhere and helped them catch the main concepts of the synthetic biology.Overall, we first introduced the development of the synthetic biology,then the origin, the competition and where the iGEM competition is held.Then, we talked about some basic biobricks to yield our target proteins, and introduced the functions and properties of the enzymes that were usually used.In order to let students have more complete experimental structure, we designed a cyclic illustration to represent the relations of each step, and introduced each experiments contents and necessities by simple words.LinSix2012/7/108:30~12:00Q&A and group discussionTSAI,LU-AN?At the second day of the camp, we prepared a lecture for introducing the future development of synthetic biology; at this day we aimed to let the students know some basic knowledge as well as the competition methods of iGEM and how we did the experiments.We did our best to introduce many contents in easy way.On human practice aspect, on one hand, in order to promote the synthetic biology efficiently, the three teams think of ideas and shared the creative and effective ideas together hoping that we could broaden the scope of the human practice to make more people know synthetic biology as well as increase the visibility of iGEM; on the other hand, we could share things each team have been done to understand each other.We discussed the popularization and application of the synthetic biology in this platform.On the experimental aspect, just like a real and formal iGEM competition, each group presented their own topic in an extremely formal and extraordinary style, hoping that more information could be given to the audience in limited time; after each group finished their presentation, there would be a time for Q & A in which everyone could ask questions, in case they didn\u0092t understand.After the experiment began, we put our iGEM team members into each group so that they can avoid making mistakes during the experiment and help the students in understanding the experimental technique.The E.coli we prepared for them had been transplanted red fluorescent protein gene, and it is in beautiful red color at the beginning.Finally, we gave scores according to their creativity and feasibility of their answer, just like a real iGEM competition, so that the students could personally experience the presence of competition.We played this video in the student diner at lunch time, so people can relax and see this vedio like they\u0092re watching a movie.After watching the short video above, some students told us that they want to know more about iGEM.In order to allow students clearly understand the concepts and methods of the synthetic biology, we edited some basic introduction and easy examples into the handouts.On the fourth day of biotech-camp, we prepared special half-day experimental course for students experience to the experimental techniques which our team used frequently: bacteria culture, plasmid extraction, electrophoresis, etc.Then we explained the steps and principle of experiment by PowerPoint clearly to increase the familiarity of experimental operation, and prevent any accidents from happening.Department of Biological Science and Technology and Department of Communication and Technology cooperated to make a Brief introduction to synthetic biology.With the skill of CT and knowledge of DBT, we make a video with four simple Q&As.We hope this short interview can help the public understand the applications and techniques, as well as the influence of synthesis biology.By the way, we've created a Facebook Page for those interested in Synthetic Biology.At the end, they could totally get into the profound of the synthetic biology.3, we could see that the age between twenty and thirty contribute the most on 'accept' option, and the age between ten and twenty also choose the accept one as their answer.So, these ranges of people have the tendency to accept synthetic biology.Figure 4.We continued analyzing the people who have ever heard about synthetic biology, and from Fig.Therefore, we could see that this cutting edge science, synthetic biology, is taught in almost college students as well as senior students in Taiwan.These were all questions we wanted to test them, and we hoped that they could learn a lot from the courses.So they could understand the course easily as well as do exercises right away to test them whether they really understood what we had taught in the class.1 shows that one third of people have ever heard about the synthetic biology.As a result, we must do our best not only on popularizing the synthetic biology but also letting people know it completely.We hoped that those who received our folders could have a deep impression on NCTU iGEM team as well as our experimental topic ,E. coline, and our experimental purposes which is solving the problem of energy crisis and air pollution, life would be better by our project.Our designed ideas as follows:On the front side shows a blackboard sketched with our ideas of producing biosynthetis isobutanol to make a better life.In the last day of the camp, we held a competition to test the learning achievement and knowledge that each group member learned in previous days.The most important thing we have done on promoting synthetic biology is that we have made a synthetic biology guiding book featuring many experimental protocols and well-illustrated graphics which could help people know the purpose of experiment much easily.Genomics Research Center also generously provided us the opportunity to visit their lab and they explained how the equipment works in detail.2, we found that about one third of people accept the synthetic biology, and when Fig.The points between each team were very close, so every students tried hard to recall the lessons they learned, hoping to win for the team.We even tried to do Surveys from high school students, netizens around the world and professors from National Chiao Tung University and made L-shaped folders to preach our word to the world.So we made another video, sharing our experience on our experiments, trial-and-error learning, joining the iGEM final competition in MIT, and other feelings that can't be express by words.This significant color change phenomenon made the student surprise and gave rise to their curiosity on iGEM, finally, aroused their passion on the experiment.For the left part, we illustrated the pathway that indicates how cellulose is metabolized to isobutanol by constructing the enzymes, while for the right part shows two major method to increase the production rate of biosynthetic isobutanol , temperature control system and zinc finger utilization.We invited two professors to join us, and hoping that they could answer the questions pointed out by students.", "modeling": "But overall, despite the phenomenon described above, our modeling meet our expectation.In addition to the isobutanol tolerance, we also made a model to calculate the doubling time under different temperature(40\u00b0C, 42\u00b0C, 44\u00b0C).This phenomenon occurred in the doubling time of E.coli when it was cultured in 2% isobutanol concentrated medium.We observed that the isobutanol yield in E.coli is the most under 42\u00b0C , even though the amount of E.coli is not the most.According to the equation we utilized, the doubling time should be higher than that of 1.3% isobutanol concentrated medium.According to the following figures, we realize that the maximum concentration of isobutanol that seriously hinder E.coli growth is 1.3%.E.coli was incubated in 37\u00b0C until OD= 0.2, then transferred to three different temperature for 40 hours incubation.Figure 6.Simulation diagram and doubling time.We can realize that amount of E.coli is the most under 40\u00b0C and the least under 44\u00b0C.The figure gives us an important information to help us understand the growing condition of E.coli and to adjust the incubation time in our project.Figure 1.Figure 2.According to the equation of Thomas Robert Malthus, we can get the doubling time of E.coli in the following table.Figure 3.Figure 4.Theoretically, through calculation with the Thomas Robert Malthus equation, we supposed to have a higher doubling time in higher concentration.We pondered this phenomenon may be because in 2% isobutanol concentrated medium, the E.coli appeared to have a shorter lag phase than that of the other lower concentrated medium, therefore affecting the algebra of the function S(t).According to our previous data, the highest yield of isobutanol is under 42\u00b0C~44\u00b0C incubation.We tried to figure out the relationship between isobutanol production and the amount of bacterium?We supposed that the higher amount of E.coli, the higher production yield we got.It shows that there is no direct relationship between the isobutanol production and the amount of bacterium.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "track": "Food & Energy", "recommend":

uranium adsorption and recovery - we needed a protein polymer network which contains several functional modules.To address these drawbacks, the Peking iGEM team put forward the Uranyl Reaper project, which aimed to develop an innovative method to deal with uranium pollution.In order to achieve this goal, we designed an extraordinary biological adsorption polymer network which was produced by engineered bacteria and self-assembled completely autonomously.How to collect the protein polymer network together with the adsorbed uranyl from the environment?Impressively, in a trial where the concentration of uranyl was set at 10uM, the polymer network with the SUP module was able to sequester nearly 90% of total uranyl ions within just one minute.The fusion proteins could be brought to their working concentration by concentrating them directly in the culture supernatants, and the resulting crude concentrates could be used directly for the ultimate goal - the Uranium Reaper.Inspired by the autocatalytic formation of the isopeptide bond between a Lys and an Asp residue in the CnaB2 protein from S. pyogenes, researchers engineered a pair of complementary truncations of CnaB2, called SpyTag and SpyCatcher1.the results indicated that the crosslinking reaction between the Triple SpyCatcher and fusion proteins could be completed in 1 hour.Considering that uranium mainly exists as uranyl ion and its carbonate in aqueous solution, we applied the Super Uranyl Binding Protein (SUP), which was designed specifically to bind uranyl via structural calculation and functional modification.Finally, signal sequences derived from OmpA, LTIIb and PhoA were found to be efficient mediators for the secretion of our recombinant proteins.Whether in E. coli or B. subtilis, secretory proteins usually contain signal peptides that are essential for their export from the cytoplasm.Which signal peptide would best promote the secretion of our constructs was inscrutable, so a library was built in order to screen for the most suitable candidates.In view of existing as well as potential future uranium pollution, the current complicated, time-consuming, inefficient and expensive treatment methods seem woefully out-of-date.[1]Zakeri, B., et al., Peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein, through engineering a bacterial adhesin.A schematic graph of the whole project is shown in Fig.", "human_practice": "The Brochure designed for public education about the project, synthetic biology and iGEM.Additionally, we popularized iGEM among middle school students from the 2016 Peking University Alumni Children\u0092s Summer Camp (Fig.After learning about the public opinion on uranium, uranium pollution, and synthetic biology, we decided to design a popular science brochure (Fig.Uranyl concentrations in water from Weiming Lake and in coal-washing wastewater  In order to assess whether there are potential dangers in our immediate vicinity, we extracted freshwater samples from Weiming Lake on campus and coal-washing wastewater from Shan Xi province, and measured the uranyl concentrations of the water samples by ICP-MS.It could thus be demonstrated that we had no need to worry too much about the effects of uranium pollution in daily life because the amount of uranium around us was within the normal range even in an otherwise quite polluted environment, such as around coal-mining operations.Additionally, we also measured the intensity of radiation in the nuclear environmental chemistry laboratory where we did the experiments with uranyl-containing solutions.), with the aim of helping them to develop a passion for biology, life sciences and synthetic biology.During this summer camp, there was a team coming to visit our lab and they were quite interested in the routine work of the iGEM team (Fig.In addition to the questionnaire survey and interviews of front-end units and experts, we have done more work related to social practice.Interestingly, the radiation intensity value in the work area was close to that determined in the playground, which could be regarded as the background value.Both were well within the drinking-water standard of the EPA which states that the amount of uranium shall not exceed 30 ug/L, or about 126 nM1.", "modeling": "They made it a way to choose the monomers suitable for crosslinking reaction.The Peking iGEM Team has studied and expanded Paul J.

commercially activated carbon, which has a very high and restrictive cost associated with it; this makes it far from a globally attainable solution for copper removal (Bhatnagar & Sillanpaa, 2010).Although each of these methods is successful to a degree in removing copper from water, none exist without detrimental pitfalls (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).At least two-third of all First Nation communities in Canada have been under water advisory at some time in the last decade (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015).Although these methods are generally the most economical, and low in technology costs, they all involve plant growth, which render disadvantages due to dependence on growth conditions, requirement of large-scale agricultural equipment, and knowledge, long remediation timelines and potential environmental harm due to leaching of soluble contaminants (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).It is possible to bypass this problem by using the protein YiaT anchor system designed by Han and Lee to bind and sequester copper outside the cell (2014).Furthermore, the solubility of metal hydroxides poses the problem of precipitating one heavy metal out of solution, and another back in due to their individual maximum precipitation pH\u0092s (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).Han and Lee discovered that when truncated at the arginine residue 232 (R232), the Pseudomonas lipase could be fused to the new C-terminal end of YiaT to make a functional fusion protein (2014).Currently, the removal of copper from water is accomplished through a slew of methods ranging from large-scale and industrious technologies to small-scale household friendly products.The community of Trail, BC has battled pollution from Teck Metals since 1975 (Hume 2016).The community is afflicted with contaminated landfills, slag deposits that leach into waterways and a substantial plume that has spread beneath the city and the Columbia River (Hume 2016).Particularly, Alexis Creek First Nation, Nazko First Nation and Lake Babine, all in British Columbia, have water problems spanning 16 years (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015).Our team is investigating methods of copper binding in order to contribute to the promising advancement of this remediation method.Children from the community have also demonstrated elevated levels of lead in their blood (Hume 2016).This poses a problem when attempting to use E. coli to remove heavy metals from water.Remediation of heavy metals in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems: Processes and applications.B., & Muchie, M. (2010).Although many bacteria require low concentrations of heavy metals, high levels of copper and other heavy metals can be toxic to many bacteria including E. coli.Using this anchor system, it is theoretically possible to place a copper binding protein, or any other heavy metal binding protein, to the outside of E. coli.1.Hume, M.

malate, 8F shows stronger response, while McfR shows weaker response.AnalysisThe tendency of the chemotaxis towards chemical gradient may be influenced by two factors: pH and phosphorylation state of McpS.BBa_K515102 (8F) is a biobrick from 2011_Imperial_College_London, which responds to L(-)malic acid (HO2CCH2CH(OH)CO2H).Fig.3 Agar assay: The three plates shows the chemotaxis results of 8F towards three kinds of attractants, malate, citrate and succinate from left to right.So both of biobrick BBa_K515102 and our biobrick BBa_K1405004 have chemotaxis towards malate, and other McpS with the conserved sequence may response to the same ligand.But there were significant differences among 8F & 5A, and McfR & 5A: the number of cells of 5A are far less than 8F or McfR (p < 0.05), which demonstrated that 8F and McfR have chemotaxis towards succinate and the capacity of chemotaxis of 8F and McfR towards succinate are almost equal.The picture B is from Dr. John Illingworth's Lab - University of Leeds ( The website address Compared with the work of 2011_Imperial_College_London had done, we find that both of their biobrick BBa_K515102 and our biobrick BBa_K1405004 (originally found in P. aeruginosa and P. putida separately) have chemotaxis towards two kinds of TCA intermediates, malate and succinate (Fig.7 A).reported high-resolution structures of the ligand- binding region of the cluster II McpS chemotaxis receptor (McpS-LBR) of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 in complex with malate and succinate (Fig.7 B& C) .Fig.5 The pH of the concentration gradients of malate and succinate.Both of them remain pH 6.4 at low concentration(10-5, 10-7 and 0 M).On the other hand, the E. coli chemotaxis along gradients is influenced by reversible MCPs methylation and related proteins phosphorylation (Fig.If the attractant concentration increases, the MCPs tend to adopt the CCW signaling conformation, Che A and Che B thereby lose their activities, and methyl group removal becomes progressively less efficient.With the attractant concentrations increase, the McpS are progressively converted into the fully methylated state with a low affinity for the attractants.The picture A is from Parkinson Lab - University of Utah ( The website address [http://chemotaxis.biology.utah.edu/Parkinson_Lab/projects/ecolichemotaxis/ecolichemotaxis.html]).Therefore, the two hydrogen bonds that are established between the malate hydroxyl group, and the protein cannot be formed in the succinate structure.(B and C) View of the interaction of malate (B) and succinate (C) with the McpS-LBR.The remaining interactions of succinate with R60, R63, R254, and Q65 are analogous to the malate structure where they establish six hydrogen bonds.As the attractant concentration increased, the number of cells arose and reached the maximum at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and fell sharply with the minimum at attractant concentration of 10-1 M. The quantities of cells of 8F and McfR were almost equivalent and did not have significant difference.Properties of the modelFig.7 (A) The structure of malate and succinate, and the thermodynamic parameters for the 2 compounds that were found to bind.The tendency of curve of 8F was biphasic with maximums at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and 10-5 M, while the tendency of curve of McfR was biphasic with maximums at attractant concentration of about10-2 M and 10 -7 M. Both of them reached minimum at attractant concentration of about 10 -1 M, the number of cells decreased slowly with attractant concentration decreasing for 8F and McfR.In a sequence alignment of McpS-LBR homologs containing McpS-LBR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the amino acids involved in malate and succinate binding are conserved.Succinate: The tendencies of curves of 8F and McfR towards succinate are same.Such adaptation is achieved in E. coli by modulating the methylation state of the MCPs using two proteins, a constitutively active methyltransferase CheR and a methylesterase CheB (Fig.6 B), the activity of which is stimulated after phosphorylation by CheA-P.Malate binds to a cavity formed by ?1 and the C-terminal segment of ?6, and its coordination is achieved through interactions with R60, R63, R254, and T258 from one monomer and Q65 from the other monomer.B: At low attractant concentrations, or when a repellant is bound, most of the MCPs are in the CW signaling state.The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the malate and succinate cocrystal structure is only 0.2 \u00c5 indicating that differences in the nature of the ligand do not significantly alter the protein structure (Table 1).Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors FliM; phospho-CheB has high MCP methylesterase activity that helps to change the CW rotation to CCW rotation, and they will be inactive because of loss of phosphoryl group through spontaneous self-hydrolysis.The pH of malate is lower than succinate at high concentration (10-1 and 10-2 M), and is equal with succinate at lower concentration.The highest concentration of 0.1M is pH 1.0 of malate and 2.0 of succinate, which leads to weakest chemotaxis, for oxidative stress induces its protective responses more than chemotaixs genes expression; while the curves reach maximum at concentration of 0.01M because of the opposite reason.5A is a control which doesn\u0092t have chemotaxis towards malate or succinate.Malate: McfR showed the strongest respond.The plasmids are biobricks, BBa_K608003 and (they are from 5A and 8F wells in plate1), and the McfR plasmid was designed by us.Lisa M. Maurer and Elizabeth Yohannes proved that low pH (at pH 5.0) induced the expression of some flagellar and chemotaxis genes and proton export, while coinducing oxidative stress and heat shock regulons to maintain internal pH homeostasis and to prepare the cell to survive future exposure to more extreme pH conditions (below pH 5 or above pH 9 which is higher or lower than the cytoplasmic pH 7.6).So both of 8F and McfR have chemotaxis towards malate.Increased methylation of the MCPs dampens the response to ligand binding, whereas decreased methylation restores their high binding affinities for their attractants(Butler, S. M., & Camilli, A., et al.).In this state the McpS have high affinities for the attractants and are able to detect very low concentrations of these effectors.", "track": "Environment", "recommend":

"description": "Candidates for genetic rheostats must meet two basic criteria: firstly, they should possess a relatively plain dose-response curve, which would allow for precise translation strength modulation within a wide range of ligand concentration; secondly, ligands they recognize should be genetically and biochemically orthogonal to the host cells, in our case, E.coli cells, as much as possible.In order to fulfill the goal of establishing an extensible and versatile methodology for softcoding of genetic program, our team reached out to a great extent to search for available ligand-responsive riboswitches/ribozymes that meet our criteria and selected them as our genetic rheostats.The genetic rheostats are truly modular ligand-responsive riboswitches, while the RBS calculator is software for both translation of ligand concentration into quantified translation strength and automated design of synthetic ribosome binding sites (RBS) with customized strength.By altering the upstream promoter and downstream coding sequence of the genetic rheostats, we demonstrated that their performance was independent of sequence context, which proved that our genetic rheostats are modular.In our project, we are aiming at establishing an extensible and versatile methodology for the softcoding of genetic program in bacteria, composed of genetic rheostat and RBS calculator.To further extend the repertoire of our genetic rheostats, we created a ribozyme that functions with a different mechanism, which has an extreme low basal level.By coupling an adenine aptamer with hammerhead ribozyme and randomizing nucleotides in the linker domain, we evolved new genetic rheostat through dual selection, whose self-cleavage could be regulated by adenine.", "design": "Based on the principle of softcoding, this year our team established an extensible and versatile platform for softcoding of genetic program, which is composed of \u0093genetic rheostats\u0094 and an \u0093RBS calculator\u0094: genetic rheostats consist of interoperable and truly modular ligand-responsive riboswitches/ribozymes, while the RBS calculator is automated design of synthetic ribosomal binding sites (RBS) with customized relative translation strength.Based on their pioneering work, we developed an RBS calculator that correlated the performance of the RNA controllers under certain concentration of ligand to relative translation strength met by corresponding RBS sequence.Since the genetic rheostat tunes translation by decreasing or increasing the probability of RBS exposure, which is proportional to translation strength, we can achieve the mapping process merely by determining the translation strength of the fully exposed RBS.When combining them together, a quantitative correlation between the concentration of specific ligand and synthetic RBS\u0092 relative translation strength can be established.Combining this RBS calculator with our genetic rheostats, we can generate an RBS sequence through automated design once we achieved an ideal configuration of genetic programs through genetic rheostats.Therefore, when tuning genetic program, customized RBS\u0092 relative translation strength at multiple sites can be high-throughputly achieved without having to conduct laborious mutagenesis and characterization, followed by easily determining the configuration of RBS(s)\u0092 relative translation strength.The results demonstrate that, for given gene circuit, our genetic rheostat and RBS calculator combination can not only determine its function-translation strength map but also can precisely predict and implement any desired possible function.[6] used Gibbs energy (?G) of the \u0093docked\u0094 state of the mRNA-30S ribosomal subunit complex to predict the translation strength of RBS sequence.In our project, we selected riboswitches as the genetic rheostats.Conventionally, translation strength was calibrated with a library of RBS mutants.But this approach is not truly reliable, because the strength of RBS strongly depends on the surrounding sequence, for instance the coding sequence.Recently, RNA devices have emerged as powerful tools to regulate gene expression in vivo, and particularly, ligand-responsive riboswitches enable us to manipulate translation strength of specific genes upon different concentrations of ligands [5].To further extend the range of application of our genetic rheostats, we created a ribozyme that functions with a different mechanism, which has an extreme low level of backgrounds.", "human_practice": "In order to investigate the extent to which laboratories understand biosafety issues in regard to antibiotic use, we have carried out a survey involving about 150 participants (including researchers from laboratories in the College of Life sciences and College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering in Peking University, and employees at a few sequencing companies) who responded to a series of questions related with treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the laboratory.However, the abuse of antibiotics, combined with the widespread use of antibiotic resistance genes as selection markers, have lead to a worldwide hazard to public health - bacterial antibiotic resistance.According to the responses given by the number of participants who have responded, it may be concluded that, in general, laboratory researchers are aware of potential safety issues related with the use of antibiotic and resistance genes, but the level of awareness is far from sufficient for restricting laboratory work in a way that minimizes possible hazards as a consequence of microbes\u0092 antibiotic resistance.The first few questions look into the extent to which antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) are employed in laboratory research.Despite the lack of statistical data confirming the scale of antibiotic use, it is reasonable to estimate that the majority of antibiotics and related products are used in agriculture for their cheapness and safety to livestock.The challenge in confronting antibiotic resistance lies in the possibility that even if antibiotic use is reduced, resistant clones would remain persistent and cannot be rapidly outcompeted by their susceptible relatives[3].Antibiotic in agriculture  From scct.net\r \rIt is relatively more difficult for the public, however, to establish the correlation between antibiotic use on farm animals and potential hazards to public health.As the public does not strictly follow instructions at all times, bacterial antibiotic resistance is further aggravated.Researchers, being too familiar with antibiotic-resistant bacteria to treat them with caution, may also jeopardize public health even if they have undergone professional training in biosafety.Enterohemorrhagic E.coli  From HZI\rIt is widely believed that the abuse of antibiotics accounts for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Though antibiotics have been considered as the primary solution to most infectious diseases and have saved billions of lives since their discovery, more and more bacterium become resistant against them.Researchers, being too familiar with antibiotic-resistant bacteria to treat them with caution, may also negatively affect public safety even if they have indeed undergone professional training in biosafety.To make matters worse, in many countries, the public has access to antibiotics without prescriptions.CAUSE\r \r\rInappropriate use of antibiotics is a major cause of bacterial antibiotic resistance.For more information, please click SchoolVisit\r\rSince their discovery, antibiotics have been considered as the primary solution to most infectious diseases and have saved billions of lives.Antibiotic pills  From topnews.net.nz\r \r Inappropriate use of antibiotics is a major cause of bacterial antibiotic resistance.This further adds to the potential danger of pollution and transfer of antibiotic resistance to microbes in the environment.Therefore, there exists a large pool of antibiotic resistance that is foreseeable threats to the environment.For the purpose of informing young people the right way to use antibiotics, we take a school visit.Common treatments, such as pouring solutions or medium containing microbes into the sewer or throwing them into garbage cans, may expose antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the environment, increasing the risk of transferring antibiotic-resistant genes to wildtype microbes.Unfortunately, statistics revealed that over one third of the respondents reported that used ARB is never or only occasionally processed in safe and professional ways, and that a considerable portion of them has no special attention paid to the issue (Q5).However, the participation of researchers lacking systematic training in biosafety inevitably increases the risk of biohazards, including:\r\r\r1.Improper treatment of microbes and corresponding DNA fragments in the laboratory by researchers unaware of biosafety.Increasing reports regarding superbugs - bacteria that are resistant to most common antibiotics - is also raising public concern.The government should pay attention to the distribution and application of antibiotics.Consequentially, excessive amounts of antibiotics selects for

soluble in limonene (an environmentally friendly solvent), but ABS is not.Currently we have isolated organisms from environmentally exposed polystyrene, and are progressing in our aim of adapting the toluene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas species.Re-using - Consumer 3D printers are now a reality and use a variety of thermoplastics (PS and ABS, for example).This should yield DNA cheap enough to burn and when added to EPS make it flame retardant and environmentally friendly.We are adapting limonene biosynthesis biobricks developed in previous iGEM competitions to enable genetically engineered machine biological 'finishing' of 3D printed objects.Re-purposing (DNA!.)EPS insulation is required to be flame retardant, which is currently achieved by incorporating environmentally polluting halogenated hydrocarbons.- Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a great insulator, used by the construction industry to make our homes warmer, using less energy.Complex 3D printed shapes require removable support structures - one solution is to print the supports using PS and the object in ABS, with the PS being removed by limonene dissolution.", "design": "The isolated DNA was then cut with EcoRI and PstI and fragment sizes representative of the backbone and biobrick were visualized using gel electrophoresis.The limonene biobrick supplied had a Lac operon preceding the limonene synthase genes.We were able to demonstrate that a 50% solution of limonene in a 20ml solution dissolves an 8cm x 5cm x 2cm block of polystyrene in approximately 9 minutes (video below).limonene disolution from Quezia Toe on Vimeo.Our idea was to characterise the limonene biobrick (BBa_K118025) created by the Edinburgh 2008 iGEM team.Therefore we proceeded to carry out a fusion PCR on the tod F, X and B genes.These 3 tod genes were made into biobricks which were ligated to the iGEM supplied backbone (pSB1C3).Therefore non-parametric tests (Spearman correlation and Kendall tau tests)were used for statistical analysisThe non-parametric test used included; Spearman correlation and Kendall tau tests.Samples 1,2 & 3 = RFP platesSamples 4,5 & 6 = 10.2 platesSamples 7,8 & 9 = 5.1 platesCorrelation was made between each of the RFP plates and the limonene biobrick/pBS1C3 plates (there were 9 plates in total; 3 RFP and 6 limonene biobrick transformant plates) in the following order:a) Samples 1, 4 and 7b) Samples 2, 5 and 8c) Samples 3, 6 and 9After carrying out both tests (Spearman and Kendall) on groups a,b and c, p-values were < 0.05.The aim was to introduce the pSB1C3 backbone, is to separate the colonies that have incorporated the limonene biobrick, because those would be the ones present on a chloramphenicol plate.We digested the backbone and the biobrick with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes.Mechanical processes such as sonification and hydrodynamic shearing were used to make the DNA more spreadable.Initial combustion tests were carried out using DNA-coated paper-thin strips of polystyrene which were compared with water-coated polystyrene strips shown in the video below.iGEM combustion from Quezia Toe on VimeoIt is evident from the video that the addition of DNA aided the flammability of the polystyrene.Modelling carried out by the Leicester 2012 iGEM team using the programme Pymol, suggested that the gap in the active site of the TDO enzyme could be widen to fit polystyrene.This can be used as a starting point for future research albeit we propose that the cotton experiment should be replicated in order to confirm that DNA is able to give flame-retardancy property to materials.Unfortunately due to time constraint we were unable to run further testing to determinate the cause of the lack of limonene synthesis.Re-purposingExpanded polystyrene is widely used as insulation in the construction industry.Future Leicester iGEM team can continue to build biobricks of the other genes of the tod operon, especially todC1C2 genes that encodes the catalytic site of the TDO (toluene dioxygenase) enzyme, and proceed to characterise the biobricks created by this team.Re-usingThe second stream was centered on re-using polystyrene in consumer 3D printers.This suggests either a fault in the limonene biobrick or a disfunctional promoter.Modified Toluene 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme with a similar view to the image above.We aimed to induced the production of limonene by growing bacteria with the incorporated ligated DNA (transformants) on chloramphenicol and IPTG plates.To confirm this overnight broth was made from the colonies whose DNA was isolated using mini prep.Hence the correlation between the RFP (control plates) and the limonene biobrick plates.They modified amino acids present in the gap by reducing their side chains in order to widen the gap that could allow polystyrene into the active site.As shown below (Spearman and Kendall respectively);a) Between 1& 4 - p-value= 6.412e-10 and 2.53e-07Between 1 & 7- p-value = 9.82e-13 and 4.558e-08b) Between 2 & 5- p-value = 1.534e-09 and 3.1e-07Between 2 & 8- p-value = 3.579e-12 and 5.655e-08c) Between 3 & 6- p-value=8.359e-13 and 3.81e-08Between 3 & 9 - p-value=3.566e-12 and 7.004e-08Thus the null hypothesis (There is no correlation between the RFP plates and limonene biobrick/shipping vector) was rejected.In conclusion, it seems that the stats tests cannot detect limonene expression too!Hence the main objective was to modify the dioxygenase genes responsible for toluene degradation so that polystyrene can fit in the active site of the enzyme.The todC1C2BA genes encode the toluene dioxygenase (TDO) enzyme which is capable of oxidizing more than 100 substrates albeit the catalytic oxygenase is encoded only by todC1C2.Volatile organic compound (VOC) was carried out in order to detect the presence on limonene on the plates.Therefore the team decided to use the biobrick to try to produce limonene-expressing bacteria which would be a cheaper method of synthesizing the solvent.Limonene is a colourless hydrocarbon present in the rinds of most citrus fruits.It was later confirmed that the polystyrene sugar supplied to us was in fact incorporated in HBCD.Block Combustion from Quezia Toe on Vimeo.Unfortunately due to time constraint we were unable to aquire the non-HBCD incorporated polystyrene sugar to use for further tests.Colonies that were present on the chloramphenicol plates were successfully transformed with the ligated plasmid.(left) The polystyrene substrate has been omitted for clarity, but note the gap is much bigger now (modified from 3EN1).(right) The polystyrene is present here: note the very tight fit into the gapA side view of the modified enzyme.The data obtained from the test had a non-normal frequency distribution (positively skewed) which was confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test.The dioxygenase enzyme encoded by the tod operon degrades toluene which has a similar structure to the styrene monomer of polystyrene.Note that the terminal phenyl group is in the active siteThis view is just of the toluene 2,3-dioxygenase active site (blue), overlapped with the modified version (pink).From the graphs below, these 2 important peaks that would indicate the presence of limonene were absent, which suggested that limonene was not synthesized.This new video recording (below) brought to our attention the possibility that the polystyrene we were using might in fact be coated in HBCD.Previous studies have shown that limonene can be used to dissolve polystyrene and from the iGEM registry we know that a limonene biobrick exists.", "human_practice": "These consisted of \u0091shout outs\u0092 on our Facebook page, a papercraft R2D2, requests to do anything (walking backwards, wearing funny

PETase and MHETase.", "modeling": "Finally, we can get the unstable diffusion differential equation while the enzymes near the cells are secreted along direction r.$$ frac{{ partial E}}{{ partial t}} = D frac{1}{{{r^2}}} frac{ partial }{{ partial r}}({r^2} frac{{ partial E}}{{ partial r}}) + {r_E}$$Integrate the equation above then we can get the distribution equation of the enzyme concentration.If we use the diffusion rate equation, the rate of enzyme diffusion from cells to liquid phase body can be described as: [ frac{{d{E_x}}}{{dt}} = {k_c}{a_c}({E_c} - {E_x}) ]Mass transfer process of enzymes from liquid phase to the surface of PETSimilar to the process of diffusion from cells to liquid body, based on Fick\u0092s first law and mass conservation we can get the differential equation of the diffusion process.$$ frac{{ partial E}}{{ partial t}} = D( frac{{{ partial ^2}E}}{{ partial {x^2}}} +  frac{{{ partial ^2}E}}{{ partial {y^2}}} +  frac{{{ partial ^2}E}}{{ partial {z^2}}}) + {r_E}$$If we integrate the formula above, we can get the distributing equation of the enzyme concentration.Similarly with the diffusion rate equation, the equation of the rate of enzyme diffusion from liquid to PET surface can be obtained:$$ frac{{d{E_p}}}{{dt}} = {k_p}{a_p}({E_x} - {E_p})$$The total diffusion equation of the process can be described as:$$ frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = Ka({E_c} - {E_p} -  Delta E)$$The loss of driving force of mass transfer caused by the enzyme concentration accumulation in the liquid phase.Assuming that the diffusion process in liquid phase is a dynamic balancing process, which means the concentration variation in the liquid phase body is equal to the rate of enzyme production, it can be describe as:$$ frac{{d{E_c}}}{{dt}} - {r_E} =  frac{{d{E_P}}}{{dt}}$$ [ frac{{dE}}{{dt}} =  frac{{({E_c} - {E_x}) -  frac{{{r_E}}}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + ({E_x} - {E_p})}}{{ frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} +  frac{1}{{{k_p}{a_p}}}}} ]So the relationship between the parameters in total mass flux equation and those in interphase mass flux equation is:$$ frac{1}{{Ka}} =  frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} +  frac{1}{{{k_p}{a_p}}}$$As we can see, the total resistance for enzymes in liquid phase is the resistance from cell surface to liquid phase body plus that from liquid to PET surface.As a result, the most of the resistance for enzyme transfer in liquid phase is that from liquid to PET surface, which can be described as: [ frac{1}{{Ka}} =  frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} ; ; ; ; ;K  approx  frac{{{k_c}{a_c}}}{a} ]After secreted by cells, enzymes diffuse to the surface of PET through liquid phase.In the process of mass tranfer, enzyme concentration in liquid phase will be balanced with that on the surface of cells and that on the surface of PET.Thus some enzymes will remain in liquid phase body.And the mass transfer process will lead to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface.This can be expressed by the equation below:  [ int_t^{t + T} {Ka({E_c} - {E_P} -  Delta E)dt = {E_c} - {E_P}}  ] The equation above is an integral equation.Corresponding differential equation is: [Ka[ frac{{dT}}{{dt}} Delta E(t + T) -  Delta E(t)] =  frac{{ Delta E(t)}}{{dt}} ]Intergrate this equation and we get the relation between delay time T and time:The process of PETase adsorbing on PET surface and enzymes catalyzing PET degradationThe biodegradation of polymer by enzymes is a kind of heterogeneous enzymatic reactions.So the rate of degradation of polymer, the absorbed enzyme amount, the inactive combined enzyme mount, the density of ester bond on polymer surface and the superficial area have the following relation: [v = -  frac{{d{n_{ exp }}}}{{dt}} = A  cdot {k_2}  cdot { rho _{EB}}({q_E}A - {n_E}) ]Connecting with the absorption balance and the substrate restrain balance, we can get the total rate of degradation equation: [v = {k_2}{ rho _{EB}}( frac{{{K_A}[E]{q_{{E_{ max }}}}A}}{{1 + {K_A}[E]}} - {K_A}{K_B}{[E]^2}[P]  cdot V) ] [[E] =  frac{{[{E_P}]}}{{1 + {K_A} + {K_A}{K_B}[P]}} ]The concentration of enzymes on the plastic surfaceBecause the concentration of enzyme is low in the system and the producing rate of MHET is equal to the rate of PET degradation, we can get the following formula: [ , -  frac{{d{n_{ exp }}}}{{dt}} =  frac{{Vd[P]}}{{dt}} ]Considering that MHET in substrate restrain is easy to diffuse to liquid, which means the balance is small, we can get the final equation for plastic degradation: [v =  frac{{d[P]}}{{dt}} =  frac{{{k_2}{ rho _{EB}}}}{V}( frac{{{K_A}[EP]{q_{{E_{ max }}}}A}}{{1 + {K_A} + {K_A}{K_B}[P]}} -  frac{{{K_A}{K_B}{{[{E_P}]}^2}[P]}}{{{{(1 + {K_A})}^2}}}) ]The above equation is differential whose only variable is the concentrate of MHET.Connecting these two factor with the above total equation and substitute constants we can get: [v =  frac{{c[EP](t - T)}}{{d + e[P](t)}} - f{([EP](t - T))^2}[P](t) ]The concentration on PET surface is a function of time t-TSolve the above equation, then we get the curves of PET degradation rate in heterogeneous phase.From the figure above , the change of degradation rate can be divided into three stages no matter if there is liquid transmission.The mass transfer of enzymes in the liquid phase will cause some of them to stay in the liquid body and the delay of enzyme concentration changes on the PET surface.Based on the assumptions above and the description of PET degradation process in a heterogeneous system, we first establish the equation of measuring how much percent the PET degrades and how much the degrading rate is.We construct models for each step and finally deduce the rate curve of PET degradation by the enzymes secreted by bacteria in heterogeneous system.From this curve we can see that the degradation can be devided into 3 parts.In the first part, degradation rate is under the control of bacteria growth and enzyme secretion.In the second part, it is controlled by the mass transfer of enzyme in the liquid phase.In the third part, it is controlled by the catalytic ability of enzymes adsorbed on the PET surface .From the trend of the curve we can conclude that, in order to degrade PET with a higher rate or make the rate peak as soon as possible,what we first need to do is to promote the growth of bacteria.This will enhance the enzyme concentration.On the other hand, we can accelerate the diffusion of enzymes in the liquid phase.For example,shake cultivation or stirred culture,can eliminate the influence of time delay and make the degradation rate reach the peak fast.Our system assumes that PET degradation only takes place on the surface of PET.Although it's reasonable,as the degradation proceeds, small gaps will form on the plastics due to degradation.If they become so large that enzymes can diffuse into the interior of PET,degradation process will be accelerated to a huge extent.The next step of building models is to take the process and threshold value of internal diffusion into consideration.This will provide a more accurate model to describe the process of PET degradation in the heterogeneous system.Combining with the fraction of coverage we can get: [ theta =  frac{{{q_E}}}{{{q_{{E_{ max }}}}}} =  frac{{{K_A}[E]}}{{1 + {K_A}[E]}} ]Establishment of equation for rate of total degradation of PETAfter absorption to the surface, the combination and escape is a dynastic balancing process because of the competitive substrate.The enzymatic degradation is interfacial reaction before degradation in large scale.The whole process can be described in the following equation: [{r_x} =  frac{{d{c_x}}}{{dt}} = { mu _m}{c_x}(1 -  frac{{{c_x}}}{{{c_x}_m}}) ]Specific growth rate , namely the growth rate of a unit thalli concentrationWhen cells are in exponential phase, u is generally a constant,soUnder the condition when t=0, cx=cx0, we integrate the formula above: [{c_x} =  frac{{{c_x}_0{c_x}_m{e^{{ mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_x}_m - {c_x}_0(1 - {e^{{ mu _m}t}})}} ]Solve this equation and the growth curve can be obtained:The formation dynamics of expression product (PETase)The extreme diversity of metabolites produced by microbial fermentation and the complexity of biosynthesis routes in the cells cause the biosynthetic pathways and metabolic regulation mechanism of those metabolites to show diverse characterisitics.Then we use the general method of describing mass transfer process to establish mass transfer rate equation when enzymes diffuse from the cell surface to liquid phase body then from liquid phase body to the PET surface, and the distribution equation of enzyme concentration, respectively.When ??0 and ??0, the model is partial-growth coupling.Plug the cell growth rate into the equation to simplify: [{r_E} =  frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = {c_x}  cdot  left[ { alpha { mu _m}(1 -  frac{{{c_x}}}{{{c_{xm}}}}) +  beta }  right] ] [E =  alpha ( frac{{{c_{x0}}{c_m}{e^{{ mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_m} - {c_{x0}} + {c_{x0}}{e^{{ mu _m}t}}}} - {c_{x0}}) +  frac{{ beta {c_{xm}}}}{{{ mu _{xm}}}} ln  frac{{{c_{xm}} - {c_{x0}} + {c_{x0}}{e^{{ mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_{xm}}}} ]Solve this equation and the production curve of PETase can be obtained:Compared with the growth curve of bacteria, we can see intuitively that at the beginning, the correlation between the enzymes production and the concentration of bacteria is high.Based on the stationary approximate theory, we can get the total dynamics equation.[ theta =  frac{A}{{{A_0}}} =  frac{{{q_E}}}{{{q_{{E_{ max }}}}}} ]The fraction of coverage by enzyme on the polymer surfaceThe content of absorption for enzyme per area on polymerBecause enzymatic catalytic step is a rete controlling step, the absorption on polymer surface is a dynamic balancing process.Rate of absorption: [{r_1} = d[ES]/dt = {k_1}[E](1 -  theta ) ; ]Rate of desorption: [{r_2} = d[E]/dt = {k_{ - 1}} theta  ]From r1=r-1, we can get: k1[E] (1-?) = k-1?.Thus we choose the ester bond number as an index to evaluate this degradation process.The calculation formula for calculating the number of moles of ester bonds (namely the number of moles when polymers are completely degraded):$${n_{EB}} = {n_{EB/{M_{rep}}}}  cdot m/{M_{rep}} $$ The mole number of the broken ester bonds in theory(umol)The molar mass of the repeat units in the polymer(ug/umol)The percentage of degradation of ester bonds can be obtained through that ratio.Similarly, the degrading rate can also be described by a series of formulas shown below:The Equation for The Growth Rate of Enzyme ProteinsAccording to the characterisitics of microbial cell growth, Monod Equation is the most commonly used one.In our experiment we use engineered bacteria as machines to secrete PETase to degrade PET.At first the bacteria secrete PETase ,and then enzymes diffuse into liquid phase body from the cell surface ,from liquid to the surface of PET successively.PETase adsorbs on PET during which process the substrate binding sites of PETase contact with the surface.Finally PETase finds catalytic sites on plastics and combine them with its active center.Ester bonds are broken and chains in PET are ruptured,resulting in the degradation of PET.1.Marge constants: [v =  frac{{c[{E_P}]}}{{d + e[P]}} - f{[{E_P}]^2}[P] ]From the above figure, the rate of degradation without competitive restrain is pretty lower than it with competitive restrain.But the rate get down gradually with substrate restrain.Solution of PET Degradation Rate Considering The Whole SystemSolution of PET degradation rate considering the process of cells secrete proteinWe have got the rate of enzyme production by connecting with the growth process of cells before.Solve the above differential equation, we can get the curves of the rate of PET degradation as following:From the above figure, enzymes get to the absorption balance and get the biggest rate of degradation.We analyze and then make a conclusion that the mass transfer diffusion mainly leads to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface .Finally, taking that MHET, the product of PET degradation, will show competitive inhibition effect into consideration, based on the adsorption equilibrium of PETase on the PET surface, we use the steady state approximation theory and deduce the total kinetic equation of PETase degrading PET.Finally, PET degradation rate settle out because of both the two factor, mostly because the absorption gets its saturation.Rate of the whole process for cells to secrete and degrade in heterogeneous phaseWe just calculated the enzymatic degradation rate while ignored the transmission in the liquid.The universal model can be expressed by Leudeking-Piret Equation: [{r_E} =  frac{{dE}}{{dt}} =  alpha  frac{{d{c_x}}}{{dt}} +  beta {c_x} ]A product synthesis constant associated with bacteria growth(g\u0095g-1)A product synthesis constant irrelevant with bacteria growth(g\u0095g-1\u0095h-1)When ??0 and ?=0, the model is growth coupling.From those equations we can get the total mass transfer rate equation of the enzymes in a heterogeneous system.So there are two transfer processes before the enzymes adsorp on the PET surface.The mass transfer process of enzymes in the liquid phase bodyCells secrete enzymes to the outside.The rate of mass imported from the inner surface:$${r_{imp}}{ rm{ = }}{j_{{ rm{er}}}}  cdot 4 pi {r^2}$$The rate of mass output from the outside surface is:$${r_{ exp }}{ rm{ = }}{j_{{ rm{er}}}}  cdot 4 pi {r^2}{ rm{ + }} frac{{ partial ({j_{{ rm{er}}}}  cdot 4 pi {r^2})}}{{ partial r}}dr$$$${r_{acc}}{ rm{ = }} frac{{ partial E}}{{ partial t}}  cdot 4 pi {r^2}dr$$Rate of exported mass \u0096 rate of imported mass + rate of accumulation \u0096 producing rate = 0$$ frac{{ partial ({j_{er}}{r^2})}}{{ partial r}} +  frac{{ partial E}}{{ partial t}}{r^2} - {R_E} = 0$$$${j_{er}} = - D frac{{ partial E}}{{ partial r}}$$Substitute and sort this equation.Finally PET will desorb enzymes.Establishment of dynamics equation for PET enzymatic degradationAssuming that there is a bonding site and an active center in the enzyme, it combines with the substrate through its bonding site and then degrades the polymer with its active site.And with the time passing by the correlation becomes lower and finally disappears.The Transfer Process of Enzymes in The Liquid PhaseThe secretion of enzymes from cells will inevitably lead to the increase of enzyme concentration nearby.The resistance of enzymes\u0092 spread from liquid body to the surface of PET is much larger than that of from the cells\u0092 surroundings to liquid body.5.On the other hand, the enzymes in the liquid phase will reach the surface of PET along with the free diffusion of molecules.Enzymes will act with polymers through their bonding sites and combine with the substrate after their secretion and diffusion to the PET surface from cells.It takes several steps for the enzymes to complete the degradation of PET.The degradation of PET takes place on the surface of PET.7.Since the classical dynamics equation for enzymatic reaction, Michaelis-Menten equation, is based on homogeneous enzyme- substrate system, it\u0092s not suitable to describe the process of the degradation of polymers.", "notebook": "PETase enzyme after codon
