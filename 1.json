Large surfaces are used for the cultivation of energy cropsUsing biological waste can contribute to a suitable soluiton, but we have to be careful not to become deserted the arable land considering the amount of fertilizer we will have to use if we would harvest the whole plant and use it for biotechnological processes instead of just harvesting crops and returning the straw to the field.However, burning down primal forest seems not only insufficient to solve the world hunger, but it also contributes to climate change and destroys the environment.If we keep up with the current development, climate change and a lowering ground water will destroy more arable land than we can spare.If we hardly manage to feed the population, how can we guarantee the supply of biomass for other biotechnological products?Our living standard is mainly based on fossil resources.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) sees the bio-based products of the growing bioeconomy as a pillar for a sustainable future[3].Furthermore, many industrial products can t be synthesized from it and we will not be able to change all the existing biotechnological infrastructure to base on methanol.In fact, the conversion from methanol to glycogen upvalues a common industrial side product and provides the energetic potential of methanol to a broader field of industry.Today, starch from more than 480 million tonnes of cereals is used for industrial purposes[15].Hereby, the bioeconomy is one key component of a sustainable and independent future.The Search for an Alternative Carbon SourceThanks a lot to Wisam Zureik for recording and processing the video material!Someday, our children, and our children s children, will look us in the eye and they ll ask us, did we do all that we could when we had the chance to deal with this problem and leave them with a cleaner, safer, more stable world?Our world is facing serious global problems.70% of the electrical energy used contributes to the calorific value of the methanol produced)Recent technological achievments made it possible to convert CO2 into methanol with an incredible efficieny.The efficency of energy that is converted into chemical energy is about 80 times higher than the conversion of CO2 to biomass through plants and even 18 times higher than the maximal efficieny natural photosynthesis can reach[10].Of course these processes depend on high concentrations of CO2.Therefore, we can save primal forests, make a difference in the global CO2 concentrations and liberate cereals to be used as food.?

Scarlat N., et al.,The role of biomass and bioenergy in a future bioeconomy: Policies and facts.According to an official european public survey, the two most pressing ones are poverty and climate change[1]Many scientists work hard on both problems, but only together, we are able to find a solution.Therefore, we need to find a process to convert methanol into a complex carbon source, that can substitute for a currently important platform substance, starch.Plant starch is a storage molecule, consisting of ?-1,4-linked glucose monomers and ?-1,6-connected branches to form the predominant amylopectin.We need to find a way to use CO2 from air to form new products without taking up huge areas of arable landMethanol production has a potential energy efficency of around 70\u00a0% (i.e.This means that the agricultural land grew only around 0.9\u00a0%[6], which is partially caused by desertification and climate change.In the last 20 years, we deforested around 130 million ha, while getting only 47.5 million ha of agricultural area.for drug delivery systems.By upcycling methanol into glycogen, we provide a sustainable substrate for biotechnological processes and save millions of tonns of foodcrops that would have gone into industrial use.To get independent from fossil fuels, we have to developed new processes.Starch: From Food to Medicine, Scientific, Health and Social Aspects of the Food Industry, Dr. Benjamin Valdez (Ed.When we want to get independent, we will have to find other ways to get all of these products.For instance the food, textile and chemical sector

assimilation BioBricks will be valuable tools to further understand the regulation of these pathways.With our small-scale bioreactor technology, further metabolic engineering research towards a methanol-based bioeconomy will be accelerated.The energy price kept dropping and renewable energy became more efficient and available.Most of the fuels are sustainably produced by technical conversion to hydrocarbons, which are available in huge amounts.The biotechnology and starch based industry is based on a variety of substrates, mainly wastes and glycogen produced from renewable methanol.The arable land that was previously used to grow energy crops is now renatured or used for food crops.This way the interplay of protein expression and metabolic activity can be optimized.Our results indicate that HPLC might be very useful in the optimization of glycogen analytics as soon as a better purification method is developed.As the genetic tools get more advanced, other organisms can be considered.In our project, we were able to show that our engineered E.\u00a0coli strains are able to grow in the presence of high methanol concentrations and can also accumulate glycogen.The renaturing of area that was a former part of the bioeconomy, now binds a large amount of CO2 from the atmosphere which was essential to begin reversing global warming.With the left over arable land and improved agriculture, we can guarantee food security without an extensive use of fertilizers.", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "With reactions for the major-mode methanol condensation cycle (MCC) the maximal biomass reaction rate increases to 1.4.After we considered the number of genes that have to be introduced recombinantly and the presence of native formaldehyde degradation routes, we chose E.\u00a0coli as our host organism.In the iJO1366 model, the glycogen metabolism is modeled with two metabolites glycogen_c and bglycogen_c that represent unbranched and branched polysaccharide chains.In order to model glycogen formation, we introduced exchange reactions for glycogen_c and bglycogen_c and optimized the model with the glycogen_c exchange reaction as the objective function.When the glucose exchange reaction was set to a lower bound of 0 and methanol exchange to -10 (methanol as the only carbon source) and the model was optimized for the glycogen exchange reaction, a formation rate of 1.67 was observed.At the same time the ATP synthesis and consumption is fully balanced between five reactions: ATPS4rpp, PPKr, ATPM, PFK, GLGC.Conversion of Methanol to GlycogenThe iJO1366 model was constrained to a methanol uptake rate of -10 and no CO2 uptake.Using stoichiometric modeling we can make predictions for the conversion pathway and decide on a host organism.To model through which reactions molecules are converted within a biochemical network, all reactions have to be represented in a mathematical form.To construct the \"major mode\" configuration of the methanol condensation cycle (MCC) in E.\u00a0coli, the Mdh, Hps and Phi have to be expressed together with the phosphoketolase Xpk.To test if the introduction of the four reactions is sufficient to enable methanol assimilation, we added missing metabolites and reactions to the iJO1366 model.By addition of missing reactions from the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP), a maximal biomass reaction rate of 1.2 is possible.Reactions that were introduced to the model are named with a double underscore (__).Furthermore, the physiology of these strains is less understood.Wild type E.\u00a0coli is not able to utilize methanol as a carbon source.Escher [7] was used for visualization.The metabolic network is modeled under the steady-state assumption, i.e., all metabolite concentrations and reaction rates are constantAt the beginning, we searched for organisms that are worth considering for our purposes.By the heterologous expression of three enzymes, the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP) can be introduced to E.\u00a0coli [8].Reaction of the Methanol DehydrogenaseMethanol is oxidized and NADH is generated.Formation of the C6-body ba the hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (hps)Formaldehyde is assimilated with ribulose-5-hosphate to hexulose-6-phosphate.A disadvantage of the RuMP is the consumption of one ATP per assimilated formaldehyde molecule.Recently an ATP-neutral assimilation route was found in-silico [9].[1]We evaluated three candidate organisms for our conversion pathway using their genome-scale stoichiometric models:The models were loaded with COBRApy [5] and solved with GLPK [6].Due to the steady-state assumption, the model does not have exchange-reactions for glycogen.All reactions have lower- and upper-bounds that also determine if the reaction is reversible.In the steady-state of the biochemical network, the product of the matrix with the vector is the null vector.Gathering information to understand how the biochemical network operates works by setting constraints onto the reaction rates.Is it possible to go from the C1 molecule methanol to the C6 polysaccharide glycogen?In all test scenarios we introduced the metabolites D-arabino-hex-3-ulose\u00a06-phosphate and D-fructofuranose\u00a06-phosphate.Theoretical growth rate with different uptake pathwaysThe unmodified iJO1366 model is not able to grow methanol (EX_meoh_e=-10) as the sole carbon source.This is achieved by constructing a really big matrix that represents every reaction in the network and the stoichiometric coefficients of that reaction.EnvironmentalDevelopment(2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2015.03.006?

upper and lower bound will be set to less extreme values.The solution of this optimization process then gives information about the flux distribution within the biochemical network.The glycogen

chemicals, microorganism and waste in our laboratory, and how we think our organism and bioreactor will be used by other people.During the competition period we have collaborated and discussed about safety issues with many iGEM teams, but also with people from community labs and the industry.Our project falls into the category of metabolic engineering and our genetically modified cells are not intended for any use outside of an industrial facility.On the other hand, handling genetically modified organisms and methanol in a production facility does require several safety measures.Not only did we discuss biosafety throughout our project, but we were also very aware of working responsibly and safely with methanol in our growth experiments.As a result, the safety risks of using methanol are decreased remarkably while maintaining the high energy capacity of methanol.Even though biological laboratories in Germany are tightly regulated, biosafety is still a major concern to the public.One question that we wanted to answer was: Are touchscreens a good idea in the lab?To find out, we did a simple experiment: Sampling of microbes from keyboards and other surfaces in the lab.Although people have a higher suspicion towards community labs.We invited people from the Technik Garage[3], a community lab close to Hannover (Beckedorf), to Aachen and discussed via Skype call with the team Paris Saclay[4] about biosafety in general and about strategies against accidentially introduction of GMOs into the environment, which is by far the greatest concern of the public.To address that concern team Paris Saclay developed two containment strategies for GMOs, which could be usedby community labs as well.A high-quality solution of a problem is of no value if the damaged created exceeds the benefits of the solution.Like any other work, the work in laboratories has its own workplace health and safety regulations.Learn more about it on our safety form.Methanol is an important part of the chemical industry as it is used for plastics, paints, glues, and pharmaceuticals.Problematic situations especially occur when methanol gets out of a continuous, closed system or when it gets transported to a different facility.Consequently, there is the need to advance the methanol generating industry with a low proximity conversion system.We regard safety regulations as a necessity for our own well being and the environment.", "keywords": "flowthrough CRISPR-Cas expression transcription peristaltic nitrogenase Synechocystis temperature bioeconomy environments",

Dr. Lynn J. Rothschild, our team PI, evolutionary biologist and astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center, Adjunct Professor at Brown University (Molecular and Cellular Biology and Biochemistry) and at UC Santa Cruz (Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology); Dr. Jill Tarter, Bernard M. Oliver Chair for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Research at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California; and Dr. Alan Stern, former chief of all space and Earth science programs (2007-2008), current leader of NASA\u0092s New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, and current Chief Scientist at World View Enterprises, a company developing high-altitude balloons for commercial use in research and private space exploration.We tend to assume that we\u0092re working on an environmentally friendly technology, but would our method really be more environmentally friendly than growing latex in Southeast Asia?\u0094 We started reaching out to people who might be able to help us answer these questions.First, we met with Dr. Anne Schauer-Gimenez of Mango Materials, whose company produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable plastic, by a novel method.Professor Lepech, whom we met through Stanford connections, had surprisingly led us back to NASA.Our team ultimately integrated our research into the design of our project by reinvesting in the idea of developing space materials that might be repurposed in years to come.I (Amy) asked him if he could help me predict, based on gross assumptions about the scale-up process, what we would need to run an industrial-scale latex bio-manufacturing facility and what price we might expect to set for our latex.(A side note: We also met with Dr. Stephen Comello, Associate Director of the Sustainable Energy Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, who encouraged us to reach out to major rubber manufacturing companies and ask them how our technology might impact their operations and marketing strategies.These materials would need to be thoroughly purified and separated from live cells before balloon construction.We would need to come up with atmospheric sensing and UV protection mechanisms that could operate in vitro and attach to a balloon membrane.The problem of how one might operate a Mars onsite synthetic biology lab and sterilize the resulting materials remains an area for future research.We have organized the \u0093human practices\u0094 elements of our research this summer into two categories, which follow from the two spaces in which our technology might be applied: outer space and Earth.)Figure 1: Members of the Stanford-Brown Team with Dr. Alan Stern These researchers conveyed to us the inestimable value of origin of life research on other planets.And in our meetings with the Stanford Space Initiative and with Dr. Alan Stern of World View, we attempted to better understand existing needs in space exploration that might be met by biomaterials.Without going through this process ourselves, it would be difficult to realistically project price, yield, and environmental impact of our latex manufacturing method.Only about 13% of US electricity comes from renewable energy sources.4 Second, the production and distribution channels for traditional manufacturing materials have become so efficient that it is nearly impossible for biomaterials to compete on price alone.This meeting also reinforced the message to our team that we will not be able to influence manufacturing practices unless we can sustainably sell latex at or below prevailing market prices.We next met with Murthy Konda and Binod Neupane of the Joint Bioenergy Institute (JBEI) Techno-economic Analysis Team to get advice about how to predict and assess the feasibility and sustainability of our latex production.We then determined our project categories:We would need to produce materials in bacteria that could be used for a balloon membrane.Though our materials could be produced in living organisms, the final balloon mechanisms would need to work in vitro.After reviewing these documents, we quickly realized that if we wanted to develop a practical tool for interplanetary life research, that tool would need to be completely devoid of life.Genentech uses a huge amount of water: judging by their 2015 corporate sustainability letter, their water usage is equivalent to that for roughly 10% of households in San Francisco County.23 Of course, Genentech has a massive facility that produces large amounts of pharmaceuticals, and based on my conversation with Mr. Davis, the same processes that ensure the purity (and safety) of pharmaceuticals seem to be some of the most water-intensive.The Mango Materials PHB will need to be price competitive with polyactic acid (PLA) and polypropylene in order to achieve goal impact, Dr. Schauer-Gimenez explained, because 80% of consumers care only about cost efficiency.In theory, the Mango Materials plastic should create a closed-loop cycle: methane fuels plastic production, the plastic releases methane upon degeneration, and the same net methane is used to produce more plastic.Dr. Schauer-Gimenez laughed: \u0093Even our Berkeley friends who are environmentally conscious won\u0092t pay $3 a pound for plastic!\u0094 By the time our meeting was over, I had realized that investment in scale-up was not trivial.However, any potential benefit to this technology would be quickly negated if those tools were to contaminate the planet with Earth life.Developers of biotechnology for space research therefore need to go to great lengths to mitigate the risk of interplanetary contamination.Biological research tools (like our balloon) that could be developed onsite and thus eliminate transportation costs would, in theory, propel research forward.We spoke to several planetary scientists about the profound significance of responsible research on planets like Mars and Venus and on moons like Titan and Europa.In response, Professor Lepech pointed at my shirt: \u0093Only about a dime was probably spent on transport for that.\u0094) Because bio-manufacturing is so expensive and yields are so low, the market currently incentivizes bio-manufacturing of small, expensive products.They explained their strategy: the techno-economic analysis team sets a price point (or carbon emission) goal for an overall process, and then they develop a computational model to establish the thresholds that individual project teams must meet to achieve that goal.This research helps us better understand and appreciate our position in the universe.(Listen to the podcasts of our interviews with Dr. Rothschild, Professor Head and Dr. Tarter here.Pharmaceuticals are the perfect fit, as are expensive, complicated materials (like Bolt Threads\u0092 spider silk5).First, he emphasized that the environmental impact of a process is inextricably linked its energy source.Once developed for space, Professor Lepech suggested, these materials might make their way back to Earth.Any bio-manufacturing facility in the US is mostly running on fossil fuels.Even at this massive scale, it is unclear that our latex production would be environmentally friendly as compared to traditional farming.It could be, then, that space exploration will provide the necessary incentives to develop biomaterials, incentives that our Earth market economy lacks.It forces us to reconsider our definitions of life (if we found \u0093life\u0094 on another planet, would we recognize it?)and confront the precariousness of human existence (what were the conditions that allowed life to appear and evolve on Earth?).Like other biomaterials companies, Mango Materials depends on bacteria to produce their plastic; however, their bacterial ecosystem runs on methane gas.We contacted Michelin Tires to ask them about their new sustainable natural rubber policy.6 We saw this policy as indication that tire companies might be looking for more sustainable sources of rubber, since natural rubber plantations currently contribute to deforestation and are susceptible to blight.7 However, we have yet to hear back from Michelin.", "modeling": "Elementary flux mode analysis

balloon that can explore planetary atmospheres.We reduce the risk of allowing our E. coli to grow and reproduce outside of our experiments by wearing gloves, sterilising our biowaste before throwing it away, and spraying down surfaces with ethanol.How do we envision our project being used in the real world?We envision our project as a biologically-created weather balloon for exploration on Earth, Venus, Mars, Titan, or other planetary bodies.What risks might our project pose in the \"real world\"?coli is a relatively safe organism to work with, but we are still engineering genes into our E. coli that confer a number of dangerous properties, such as antibiotic resistance and the ability to create and secrete proteins that are not innate to E. coli.They are produced in E. coli, purified, concentrated, and then bound to cellulose sheets to create a temperature-sensitive colour gradient for sensing nearby temperatures during flight.How did we limit risk-taking actions during our project?E.Other risks that our project may pose is that the balloon may introduce (biodegradable but still foreign) waste onto non-Earth planets, and we can work in the future to increase the degradability of our project as well as develop safe recovery mechanisms for our balloon in space.Additionally, E. coli will be made to produce melanin that can be linked to our various membrane types using a binding domain by taking advantage of E. coli s tyrosinase pathway.Our human practices project focuses around the work that might need to be done in the future for responsibly introducing this production method into the greater community.An additional project is using the natural gas production cycle of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to produce hydrogen and oxygen gas for flight in various atmospheres.E. coli transfected with appropriate DNA will be made to produce these materials endogenously, then lysed so that the protein/polymers can be extracted and assembled into sheetlike structures.", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track": "Manufacturing", "part_favorite": "BBa_K2027000\nBBa_K2027039", "part_normal":

Mumberg, R. M\u00fcller and M. Funk, \"Yeast vectors for the controlled expression of heterologous proteins in different genetic backgrounds\", Gene, vol.By joining yeGFP to the mls with a non-polar chain we hope to observe targeted areas of fluorescence inside yeast cells that might be the yeast\u0092s mitochondria.The two vectors we chose to convert were originally known as p413-GPD and p416-GPD both were produced as part of a 32 expression vector series [9].To begin exploring these opportunities, we adapted two commonly used yeast expression vectors to the RFC 10 standard and used them to express yeGFP preceded by the mitochondrial localization signal from the mitoribosomal protein mRPS12.One of the ways that aerobic respiration can be controlled in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is by manipulating the translation of electron transport proteins.Electron transport china proteins are translated by the mitochondrial ribosome, thus we propose that by controlling the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins we can control aerobic respiration.[7] M. Woellhaf, K. Hansen, C. Garth and J. Herrmann, \"Import of ribosomal proteins into yeast mitochondria 1\", Biochemistry and Cell Biology, vol.Its ability to grow and replicate utilizing aerobic respiration or fermentation, and its ability to survive without functional mitochondria, provide opportunities to control or alter mitochondrial function to optimize production processes or develop novel cellular subsystems in the mitochondrial space.However, there are some other pathways where the protein goes through some processing in the intermembrane space.Figure 2 Individual steps of the import reaction of protein into mitochondrial matrix [6].As shown in Figure 2 above [6], Proteins that are imported to the mitochondrial matrix have a preprotein mitochondria localization signal or mls.yeGFP is a yeast codon optimized GFP protein, its excited by light in the wavelength of 395 to 485nm, and emits light at around 510 to 515 nanometers [7].To compete with fast metabolizing prokaryotes, the surviving strategy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is to quickly convert surrounding glucose into ethanol regardless of the presence of oxygen since yeasts are more tolerant to acid and ethanol [1].We decided to investigate using expression of mitochondria ribosomal protein S12 in yeast as a means of controlling aerobic respiration.When the gene encoding mRPS12 is knocked out in BY4741 yeast, the strains exhibit a petite phenotype and become unable to utilize non fermentable carbon sources like glycerol [5].Without mRPS12, yeast mitochondria lack a functioning ribosome and become unable to produce proteins necessary for aerobic respiration.[3] E.
