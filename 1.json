design specification using LFR and UCF files, and this page is integrated with the uShroom mapper tool to convert designs to a MINT elaboration.Fluigi takes in a MINT specification, and outputs design schematics in the form of SVG\u0092s for CNC mill fabrication, and EPS files for photolithography.We integrated the MINT file type, along with the Fluigi compiler into Neptune.Fluigi outputs the design in a series of visual formats: SVG files (which can be used to mill out the different layers of the microfluidic chip using a CNC mill), a JSON file (which can be used to visualize the microfluidic design with 3DuF), and EPS files (which can be used to build the chip using photolithography if the user so chooses).Netsynth has been modified for use in Neptune through a collaboration between Shane McCormack (BostonU_HW Team member) and Vaidyanathan to produce output formatted for interpretation in the context of microfluidic design.We decided to leverage the JSON visualization features which 3DuF has to offer in Neptune to display a visual of the user\u0092s chip for intuitive interaction with valves and dispensers on their microfluidic device in Neptune\u0092s Control user interface.Commands are sent to the arduino through the Neptune Control page in the form of an 8-digit code where the first 4 digits indicate the index of the pin on the arduino which the servo-syringe combination is connected to, and the last 4 digits indicate a PWM value which indicates the position which the servo should rotate to.Even Fluid Dispension-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf Integrated conversion of a set volume to dispense over time for dispensers in Neptune\u0092s microfluidic devices are integrated into Neptune\u0092s Software.To ease the usage and to help the user put all the pieces together, Neptune s Assembly Page takes the user through a step by step process where they can make and connect all the pieces required to control the microfluidic device.Through Neptune, the user is encouraged to use this fabrication infrastructure to make their chip so that they may rapidly prototype many chips inexpensively for any iterations of their experiment and easily control their microfluidic system through the Neptune interface.Each of BostonU Hardware Team s members played an integral part in the success of Neptune s development.Liquid Flow Relations & User Constraints File | Shane McCormack In order to increase accessibility of our tool (and microfluidics in general), a method for describing microfluidics in a few simple lines was formed!In order to ensure our design, build, and control workflow was functioning properly, we took designs through the Neptune workflow and tested them with mock experiments using colored water, or by collaborating with other iGEM teams to test biology inside our accessible microfluidic platform (checkout our collaborations page for more details on biology inside our systems!)This being said, MINT files are not the end of the pipeline, and this filetype must be converted to a microfluidic design schematic that can be used for fabrication.When used in the context of Neptune, 3DuF is leveraged to visualize the JSON output of Fluigi so that the user may control his or her microfluidic device intuitively through the Neptune interface.Neptune will then send commands specified by the user in the Control page to the arduino through UART.Firmware-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf The way in which Neptune communicates to the Arduino Mega which powers the control of the microfluidic chip is standardized throughout the Neptune UI-firmware interaction.3DuF\u0092s version upkeep within Neptune is designed to handle the primitive features which are used in chip design bu Fluigi (see mentor section below) outputs.Neptune-Arduino Integration | Johan Ospina & Becca Wolf Neptune can be used to operate the valves and dispensers of a microfluidic chip through an Arduino Mega.The electronic system is comprised of power inputs, stackable Arduino motor controller shields, an Arduino Mega, and various headers and capacitors to make the system respond appropriately.Mapping Mechanical Motion & Constant Flow Rate Equation | Zach Lasiuk In order to accurately control Neptune\u0092s hardware, the mechanical motion of the servo and syringe paring must be completely defined.Also, the Specify IDE has a user interface element for creating new microfluidic operators, making it very easy for designers to add new parts to their chip.Design schematics generated on the \u0093Design\u0094 page are immediately integrated with the build, assembly, and control sections of Neptune, allowing for clean navigation through the workflow.The few lines of LFR are the only things needed to run a chip through Neptune; a sample UCF is provided with Neptune that can be fine-tuned, but will not need to be written in its entirety.MuShroom mapper (a tool build by McCormack) uses this output alongside a variety of other inputs to produce a MINT file output in the Specify stage of Neptune.Neptune\u0092s microfluidic design and fabrication tool leverages projects such as Fluigi Place and Route, Mint description language, MakerFluidics, and 3DuF in order to provide the most intuitive and cohesive experience for users.The \u0093Design\u0094 page was created to encompass all the subtleties of elaborating a microfluidic chip using MINT files and configuration files.With the new facilitated design method of Liquid Flow Relations, a behind-the-scenes software tool was needed to interpret and translate the LFR and UCF into a functional MINT file.Aside from that, the Assembly page includes descriptions on how to create the infrastructure, mill out the microfluidic chip, connect the Arduino to the hardware, and set up the system for control.However, moving forward, both the Build and Assembly page would allow for the user to input their own servo and syringe combination into Neptune.3DuF will then output SVG files (for CNC milling layers of the microfluidic chip) and a JSON file for later visualization and editing purposes.Fluigi takes a MINT file as input and strategically routes the features specified in the MINT into an optimized microfluidic design.In addition to working seamlessly with Neptune\u0092s control page, there is another option to use the Arduino IDE should the need arise, retaining the ability to control both valves and dispensers.A microfluidic designer can also opt to skip specification at the LFR level, and they can go right into designing a MINT file.After the user has designed the microfluidic chip, they can then move on to select hardware components to match their needs.Neptune would then search through its database of servos and syringes to recommend hardware combinations to the user based on complex calculations involving torque, the range of pulse-width modulations, the bandwidth-delay product, and so on.In order to properly choose a system for Neptune, the overall goals of Neptune were called to mind: Low cost, easy to use, and modular.To this end, a file system had to be developed for Neptune that would allow for designers to store their designs locally on their computer, and to modify these designs through Neptune.With these design goals in mind, the piston rod system was ultimately chosen to ensure accuracy, modularity, and the ability to dispense very small to very large amounts of liquid with a feedback control active.3DuF can be used to manually draw a microfluidic design if the user wishes to bypass high-level specifications.Fluigi is a powerful algorithm that takes a MINT description of a microfluidic chip, and from this description it outputs a microfluidic chip design.After creating Neptune as a web-application, the hardware team thought of packaging the entire application into a desktop application that the biologist could download onto his local computer.A user will use an SVG file to mill out both the control and flow layers of a microfluidic chip.Neptune\u0092s \u0093Specify\u0094 page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through LFR.Fluigi-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormackAfter uShroom Mapper outputs a MINT specification of a microfluidic chip, designers can modify this file type to do fine-tuning and optimization of their design.A table of PWM and uL values at even intervals of fluid dispensing are generated and stored for each servo-syringe combination within Neptune to be used by the front end of the system to send dispense commands to the arduino.With the implementation of the LFR and UCF file types also came the development of uShroom Mapper, an algorithm that takes LFR and UCF file inputs and converts them into MINT file types.We would like to thank our mentors for all of the work they have done to allow us to bring Neptune to life.This standard consists of Liquid Flow Relations (or LFR), and the User Constraints File (or UCF).Users can compile their MINT files through Neptune, and Fluigi will in turn provide the designer feedback in a console.Explorations into the biological applications for Neptune\u0092s workflow are spearheaded by Ali Lashkaripour.Below is a detailed depiction of all of the components that are under Neptune s hood.The user can then map the hardware to the dispensers on the chip that they just designed.The ordering list would include the new hardware that the user has just selected, some predetermined items such as a roll of 3D printing support, and also some variable items like the number of 6-32 screws for instance.These would be calculated using the user s choices and the chip at hand.Currently implemented, this firmware has the capability to work with both digital and analog servos, up to 13 servo shields stacked on top of the Arduino Mega (enabling the control of over 200 servos at once), control valves with instant motion, and control dispensers with variable flow-rates.Neptune\u0092s board can use a multitude of materials and even a combination of materials, currently tested with HDPE plastic, ABS plastic, and wood.Created Parametric 3D Parts | Zach Lasiuk & Priya Kapadia To ensure Neptune meets the requirements of any microfluidic experiment with different requirements for flow-rate and max volume to be dispensed, Neptune has completely parametric 3D parts.The mapping allows Neptune to calibrate the dispensers for the experiment.This can be done by the user through the Control page in an intuitive, pictorial way.In order to be able to send commands to the arduino to be interpreted and acted upon by firmware, Neptune opens a serial communication connection with the port the arduino is connected to.Therefore we integrated the LFR and UCF file types into Neptune, and we integrated the uShroom Mapper algorithm into Neptune s backend libraries.Focusing in on the overall goals of Neptune\u0092s hardware (low cost, easy to use, and modular), the Arduino Mega was chosen to control Neptune\u0092s hardware.Design constraints of microfluidic design through Neptune\u0092s toolchain are also investigated by Lashkaripour.This is done quite simply by the user through the Control page and is as simple as selecting the port and pushing the \u0093Connect\u0094 button.The user is then provided with an ordering list consisting of all the parts that they need for the experiment.This task is fulfilled with muShroomMapper; muShroomMapper takes LFR and UCF as inputs, maps the LFR into a graph with the support of NetSynth, then informs that graph with the UCF.This problem was overcome by developing an algorithm to ensure a constant flow rate is always achieved with Neptune given the specific values of the active servo and syringe, involving two lookup tables and linear extrapolation.This parametrization unlocks great potential in the rapid prototyping of designs, where one number can be changed in the UCF, and all subsequent designs will have the updated component!All this to speak, we integrated uShroom Mapper with Neptune by sculpting a clean user interface that makes the design simple and efficient.A developer in this IDE has control over the sizing of each channel, port, valve and primitive in their design.The ability for the user to create custom 3D printing files are currently in development.This is done using an emerging standard in microfluidic hardware, the MEC board, developed by the GroverLab at University of California, Riverside.We eliminated all difficulty from Fluigi by integrating Neptune as a user interface for Fluigi.The final result is completely parametric 3D parts that adapt to a specific servo or syringe\u0092s dimensions, enabling a massive amount of freedom for synthetic biologists in using Neptune.Neptune was implemented like many other IDE\u0092s, where designers can select workspaces on their computer, and any modifications they make to their designs happen locally.To make these tools easy to use, we developed a sleek, simple and appealing user interface where LFR and UCF files can be edited and then sent to uShroom mapper for conversion to MINT.All in all, we integrated Fluigi with Neptune, providing a robust and easy to use UI for editing and compiling MINT files.In more detail, once a component is defined inside the UCF, all subsequent LFR files can utilize the symbol the component is linked to without redefining the details of the component.An inherent characteristic of the piston rod mechanical system is a non-linear response from the syringe pump being controlled.This language is used to describe the features of the specified microfluidic device in great detail including specification of feature shape, size and spacing.Neptunes \u0093Design\u0094 page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through

synthetic biology software toolswe offer our team as a point of contact to other iGEM teams that have created software solutions and would like to have these tools protected and stored on NONAAs we developed Neptune, we were faced with design choices that would have a large impact on how our workflow integrates with the synthetic biology community.In light of our Silver HP discoveries, we decided the most important design choice would be to make our workflow accessible to all: we want a workflow so easy to use that researchers in synthetic biology will be excited to make microfluidic chips.Having seen how inaccessible and prohibitively costly microfluidics are for researchers, and also having studied the virtues of open source tools for synthetic biology, we decided to integrate accessibility into our implementation of Neptune.We wanted a workflow whose hardware could be fabricated with a 3D printer, and whose software is open source so that the entire synthetic biology community can contribute to new features in Neptune.Moving forward with the development of Neptune, we decided that we would extend our silver medal HP theme of accessibility in synthetic biology.In this page, we cover 3 ways in which we expand on and integrate the theme of accessibility to our final product, Neptune.For Silver HP, we contributed a set of informational blog posts on the history of intellectual property, and IP in software and in synthetic biology today.While this is already an iGEM requirement, we are proud to say our source code for Neptune is licensed as open under a BSD-II license.We also added wiki into to the GitHub repositories for Neptune and our hardware, providing yet another resource for new users to try.These experiences drew our team to focus on accessibility in synthetic biology as a theme moving forward with our human practice contributions.This tutorial is a complete \u0093Hello World\u0094 walkthrough that will guide new researchers step-by-step through the microfluidic creation process.Indeed, the biggest setback to designing microfluidics before Neptune was the tedious, long, and difficult process of hand-specifying all features in the microfluidic device.Indeed, we were developing a complete, end-to-end microfluidic development workflow.We targeted this issue by creating a tutorial video for our software and hardware workflow.Further, we are very proud to say that Neptune is public on GitHub, and we encourage developers to fork the repo.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "From what was initially a GUI

who is responsible for their contribution, please visit the Attributions Page.Considerations for Replication | Neptune is built to be modular, accessible, parametric, and expandable.Neptune has the ability to guide a user through designing, building, and controlling a microfluidic system.In order to allow a more precise control over a microfluidic system through Neptune, we plan to incorporate sensor data collection into the GUI.Users can download any of these resources using the links below.When the user first enters Neptune, they could also go through a guided tour using the  Tour  button on the dashboard page.Neptune is capable of running up to 200 servo/syringe combinations at once, fulfilling the need for the most demanding microfluidic system.For example, if cells in a cell trap need to reach a certain level of fluorescence before a nutrient is washed over them, our future plans for Neptune provide an interface where a biologist can monitor this fluorescence using sensors (such as those manufactured by Atlas Scientific), and schedule his or her program to make intelligent decisions to dispense nutrients based on the current level of fluorescence of those cells.If the user decides to use a different servo/syringe setup than what is recommended by our system, he or she may still use our dispense conversion algorithm to control their system as it is also completely parametric.Our software is designed to convert a mL amount to be dispensed into a PWM command to be sent to the arduino such that an even dispense rate is achieved for fluid movement through the microfluidic device.If the user decides to use a different servo than that which Neptune recommends, he or she may simply enter a few measurements into the parameters listed at the top of the provided files and the designs will update automatically to reflect those changes.Further development on this functionality will incorporate the automation of controlling an experiment in a microfluidic chip through Neptune.The guided tour would step through the entire application to show the user what they need to do to make their first microfluidic chip from top to bottom.Neptune transforms the build area of a desktop CNC mill into that of an entire machine shop, and beyond.This number is calculated by finding the bottleneck in data transfer from the computer to Arduino, and the transfer rate from Arduino to motor controller shield.If an individual wishes to use, modify, or reinvent our software, firmware, or hardware, all of the material to do so is readily available to them to download at their convenience from our public GitHub repository.Otherwise, the user can visit our iGEM wiki page where they can view more documentation, tutorial videos, and so on.This conversion, however, is dependent on the specific servo/syringe combination the user has implemented.Including a safety margin of over 5x to ensure that all servo/syringe combinations can move 5x per second to ensure smooth motion all at once, Neptune\u0092s set maximum is 200 servo/syringe combinations.This will enable a scientist to run a completely automated experiment through Neptune\u0092s tool chain.", "safety":

were negative controls and demonstrate that no residual EtBr was present in the absence of DNA bonded to the glass.Figure 1 shows that EtBr localized in the regions where DNA was added to the slides.This indicates that there is at least some DNA present on these slides after the wash.It is possible to state that this is the the newly ligated oligonucleotide, a combination of both the 52mer and the 23mer.It is unclear whether or not the DNA washed off or just the EtBr.To recap, the RNA Ligation is an important step our system because it provides mean for PCR amplification of the newly assembled oligonucleotide.As a control, the second type of reaction is between a 52mer and a 43mer without any extra phosphate(This was done to also show that an extra phosphate was necessary for the ligation of both oligos).Figure 2 shows 4 different glass slides that underwent a wash step similar to the ones that would be done by the loomino device.Then, appropriate primers and PCR elements are added to the reaction chamber to amplify this newly formed sequence of DNA.The bottom two slides show slight orange fluorescence highlighted by the black boxes superimposed on the image.On each slide, the number of oranges circles corresponds to the number and location of the regions DNA was added to.Samples were sent out for sequencing to confirm that the proper sequences were present in the plasmids.At this point, we only need to purify the proteins from the Rosetta cells and test them on oligonucleotides to make sure they function properly.Sequences for the three different forms of TdT

platform and accessory modules are built from affordable off-the-shelf or 3D-printed parts, bringing the acquisition cost to a point where most laboratories can afford it.Re-inventing the lab: Development of a highly flexible, affordable and open source robotic automation platformAlmost everyone working or studying in biology have heard about liquid handlers and robots dedicated to biological sciences.1) The consumables used by these robots are expensive and can cost up to 10 times more than the usual consumables found in a laboratory, which is simply too pricey for most research groups to afford for day to day operations.Despite the fact that many know about them, and could potentially use them in their lab, very few scientists actually use automation.One of the main difficulties is getting access to one of these robots.5) Other problems like complicated not sufficiently flexible software tools (with costly updates) or the need to have dedicated personnel trained to run the robots discourage many potential users.Our team has developed an affordable, modular and open source robotic automation platform to address these problems.A second recombineering step could remove this cassette without any residual \u0093scar\u0094 sequence through a counterselection using the inducible toxin.To do so, a \u0093scarless\u0094 genome editing deletion system is being constructed using an inducible toxin and a double selectable marker (amilCP and KanR).3) Many lower throughput but still time-consuming and repetitive experiments cannot be performed by current robots because specific modules that support their automation are not available or too costly.", "design": "(Nature 2013)) were synthesized and joined to amilCP.The part was constructed using araC and PBAD

magnetic beads.Then, we used 1 \u00b5L of both PCR products to do a fusion PCR using kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-F1 and kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers).After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Although it is not tested, we are confident that the cassette should work at least as good as BBa_K1744000.To test the effect of the toxins on the cells containing the different kill swiches:2 ul of culture was used to inoculate 198 ul of LB-ampicillin-Glucose 5% or LB-ampicillin-arabinose 1%The OD[600] was measured at different intervals during 16-24 hours using a plate readerThe only medium used in this project was LB in broth and agar form.This is a problem on many levels: it\u0092s harder to get a clean PCR amplification, the recombineering efficiency and specificity is impaired with long cassette, there is some elements that can be changed or are unnecessary and ampicillin resistance is not a good positive selection marker since it allows satellite colonies to grow within an overnight time lapse due to antibiotic fast degradation.To build it, we used BBa_K1744000 as template in a PCR with the primers pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R1 to obtain a part of this plasmid that contains the kill switch without the resistance marker.Thus, the marker amilCP, with our promoter and RBS, can not be used as a positive marker in recombineering experiments, but it could serve us as a plasmidic marker to avoid plasmid background and only the gene aph3\u0092-I would serve us as a positive recombineering marker to help us select the good recombinants.To do so, we cannot use our newly constructed recombineering cassette because the toxin will not be able to counter select with a functional vcrx027(the anti-toxin) in the background.So, the pKD4 casette was amplified using vcrx028-KanR-del-F and vcrx028-KanR-del-R (see primer details in the design section).The cassette was then purified by SPRI with agencourt bead ratio 1:1 and digested with DpnI to get rid of plasmidic background.The primer used are lacZ-homology-ext-F and lacZ-homology-ext-R. Then, the cassette was integrated in the genome through recombineering using a pSIM6 containing BW25113 strain.The resulting cassette was then SPRIed using Agencourt beads and used in the recombineering experiment.The recombineering used again the same plasmid pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and arabinose at working concentration and incubated overnight.So, the method can be used, not only to purify DNA, but also to get rid of primers and non-specific bands that are often smaller than the band of interest.It turns out that if the good colonies are blue, or, if any blue colonies can be associated with a clear result (like plasmid background for example), it would be much easier to design an automated system in the BIOBOT to seek and pick only the right colonies for screening.This system will ultimately serve as the basics for automated recombineering using BIOBOT, even if we haven t had the time to actually do it with the robot because of the early deadlines.In order to test our BIOBOT platform (which could ultimately do automated MAGE experiment), a recombineering experiment has to be set-up.After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Firstly, by doing so, we will enable cyclic deletion using our cassette on pVCR94, which is the only plasmidic that we could do so beacause expresses the anti-toxin of vcrx028 which is vcrx027 and would resist to toxin induction.Those clones will be used for phenotypic test of each toxins.The different kill switches (pBAD30-[mosT;ccdB;mazF;vcrx028]) were tested (see here for the protocol) to investigate if they worked and to know which one was the best.The cells are heated up to denature it s proteins and lysate it so in the supernatant we get only the partially denatured DNA with denatured proteins.Mix 10 \u00b5L of dense culture (overnight is far more than sufficient) to 100 \u00b5L of Chelex (5%w/v in water)Incubate 10 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius (you can put your tube in the PCR to make a program that does both incubations for you)Transfers 50 \u00b5L of the supernatant in another microtube.The procedures are specified by the manufacturer, but here is how we do it:Design your primers to have at least 20 bp of homology on both sides for the adjacent part on your futur DNA construction.Using the part in that fashion, if the colonies would be blue, it would be plasmidic background and if they would be white, then they would be recombinants (since the expression of amilCP in single copy is not visible).This part contains a portion of BBa_K1744000 and the whole sequence of BBa_K1744001.Traditionally, the recombineering technique use an antibiotic resistance gene as a positive selection system.Basically, the DNA source of the transformation doesn\u0092t need to be pure for a chemical transformation and can be highly concentrated in salt.We decided to use Aph3\u0092-II, the resistance gene to kanamycin from pKD4, a commercially available plasmid that have the characteristic to have flanking FRT sequence at both sides of the Aph3\u0092-II gene.exo firstly degrades one of the two strands of a double stranded DNA fragment through its 5\u0092->3\u0092 exonuclease activity.We found that mosT and vcrx028 were the best counter-selectable markers (see here for the results)Our multi-copy plasmid results shown that mosT and vcrx028 were the best candidates for our system, but we needed to test them in single-integrated-copy for it to be more representative.Then the two purified products were used in a gibson assembly with the linearized pSB1C3 provided by the IGEM team to obtain the whole sequence of BBa_K1744002 in pSB1C3.To assess these concern, the cassette needs to be modified in order to be smaller, more efficient in PCR amplification and recombineering and easier to work with in screening assays.Even if adding this chromoprotein to the cassette makes it bigger it can still be worth it if the difference between negative and positive clones can become more visual.To build this part, we ordered a gBlock from IDT containing a P1U8 driven amilCP ORF.Secondly, the goal of this experiment is to test the recombineering in a relatable context.Therefore, we amplified cassettes containing all the needed elements of the kill switches from pBAD30-[mosT;vcrx028] (which are basically AraC with its promoter, inducible toxin with promoter and terminator and bla gene from pBAD30) with primers (killswitch_ins_LacZ_F and killswitch_ins_LacZ_R) adding homologies that allow lambda-red mediated recombination in the lacZ truncated gene of Escherichia coli BW25113.Again, one primer on two binded in the cassette and the other one binded in pVCR94.The primers (vcrx027-del-F and vcrx027-del-R) listed in  of the design section are used to amplify the cassette as described in the same section.You can see the result in vcrx027 clean deletion resultsOne major aspect not discussed in the previous sections about our cassette is that it is really big.The primer used for amplification of the cassette were pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-R.After the gibson, DNA was transformed using chemically competent cell into E. coli EC100 strain.To do so, primers described in the design sections were used on different template: pSXT, ptac-ccdb-cassette, gBlock_FG1, pVCR94.Then another PCR was done on BBa_K1744001 with the primers vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-F2 and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers) to get its whole sequence.The principle under this method is that chelex beads display chelator molecules that bind to the ions released by the cells that could inhibit PCR.The recipe for all PCR mix is as follow:The PCR mixes were all done on ice and we followed manufacturer\u0092s recommendation for denaturation and elongation temperature.For TFBI and TFBII composition, please refer to other reagents section.Dilute digestion samples 1:2 at least to get better DNA yield.Place your tube on a magnetic rack and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Once dry, resuspend the beads in molecular grade water in the volume needed for further experiments.Transfers your tube on the magnetic rack again and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Chelex DNA purification is a quick and cheap method for DNA purification.Unfortunately, we had problems amplifying the cassette in order to integrate it in the genome so we did not have the chance to test the cassette.See the results for the cassette insertion in pKD4 insertion result section.We can now test our cassette through vcrx027 deletion.The clones were confirmed by digestion and lyophilised for IGEM shipping.This part is the optimisation conclusion of the final deletion cassette.In each case, one of the two primer in internal to the pKD4 cassette and will only bind to pVCR94 if the pKD4 cassette was successfully integrated.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and glucose amounts.Since the kanamycin marker is no longer wanted in pVCR94 and is adjacent to the gene to delete, we will delete it as well.For schematique details on the resulting plasmid, please visit:The clones for each construction were screened by digestion (results not shown) and good clones for each constructions were obtained.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and arabinose amounts.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics amounts.The full protocol is available with the kit purchase.IMPORTANT NOTE: This technique can be affected by the buffer in which the DNA lies.Both come from BIOBASIC, their catalog numbers are SD7002(S518) and SD7003(S519).Here are the complete list of antibiotics used in this project with the working concentration for each:TFBI:30 mM KOAc, 100 mM RbCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MnCl2, 15 % glycerol, pH 5.8 (adjusted with acetic acid), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.TFBII:10 mM MOPS or PIPES, 75 mM CaCl2, 10 mM RbCl, 15 % glycerol, pH 6.5 (adjust with KOH), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.The polymerase used for all experiment was Veraseq from Enzymatics\u0099.They were used as described in the primer table in the design section.You can also see in the results that the colonies with BBa_K1744001 inserted in single copy in the genome were not really blue.All the tested clones for mosT shown that behavior, but only 1 of the 3 vcrx028 clones did.Those plasmid are thermosensible (the origin of replication do not work at 37 degrees Celsius) and the lambda red system is heat induced.See the protocol or See the resultsSince vcrx028 seems to work better than other toxins, we decide to use it in order to test a cyclic recombineering cassette using the as template.pVCR94 is a plasmid isolated during the 1994 cholerae outbreak in a Rwanda refugee camp.This part is basically just the previously described cassette, but transferred in pSB1C3 for IGEM shipping of the part.This comes from the fact that recombineering uses lambda red system.As the primer name says, the first pair screened the 5\u0092 end of the insertion and the second pair screened the 3\u0092 end section of the insertion.Furthermore, the longer the DNA molecule, the more affinity it will have for the beads because it carries more negative charge than smaller DNA fragments.After confirmation of the recombinants, they were tested and it shown that both killswitch were still working even in single copy.All of these primers are described in the primer table .The cassette basically contain an araC gene for repression, an arabinose inducible vcrx028 toxin and a resistance gene for ampicillin (bla), see the part description for full design information.As shown in the results, all the recombinants tested were good.We will firstly need to take out vcrx028 to take out vcrx027 with our cassette and make our cassette \u0093pop-out\u0094 with a fusion PCR of both adjacent regions.The first thing to do is to delete vcrx028 from pVCR94.That be said, we still have a working cassette with strong results to send to IGEM Headquarters as a part.Preliminary results will not be shown for they are not necessary to the comprehension of this section.To do so BBa_K1744001 was amplified using kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-F and kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-R. Then 1 \u00b5L of a 1/100 dilution of PCR product was used in a second round of PCR to enlarge the homologies to 80 bp approximately.All PCR except those specified in the text were made with 50 Celsius degrees as annealing temperature.The inserts and the vector were then mixed for Gibson experiment.It was designed to contain the advantages of both preceding parts : the working vcrx028 kill switch and the dual positive marker amilCP-aph.The results for the clean deletion was perfect.Than a polymerase will fill the sequence left empty by the exonuclease and a ligase will join both strands together.The DNA of those clones was then extracted using Chelex method and screened through PCR using 2 different pairs of primers.There is two major adds and changes to the protocol.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.It contains kanamycin resistance from pOK12 (a commercially available plasmid) which is a truncated, shorter version of Aph3\u0092-I and amilCP, a deep blue chromoprotein Biobrick standardised by a previous IGEM team from part BBa_K592009.In this section, we will detail the experiments leading to a fully working clean deletion system through recombineering.2015 for details, this version had the multiple resistance genes region deleted and replaced by Spectinomycin resistance).Those two fact explains the major changes in the protocol.The aspects of the colonies was indeed deep blue.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB ampicillin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.The plasmid used was still pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB ampicillin, streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and glucose at working concentration and incubated overnight.(2000) and uses three protein for the lambda phage: bet, gam, exo.It is now a well known technique that uses an exonuclease to degrade 5\u0092->3\u0092 one strand of DNA, permitting the homology regions to merge.The 3 \u0091 region was also amplified on the same distance with vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -R.Store at -80\u00b0C.When needed, cells can be thawed 15 minutes on ice before using them for transformationLet cells recuperate 1 hour at 37 degrees before plating them on the right selective plate.To execute this protocol, make sure you have access to an electroporator and be carefull handling the device, as its function is to give electric pulses.Furthermore, we know that recombineering works in pVCR94 since there are quite a few articles that have used this technique to modify its sequence (one of these is Carraro et al.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin and chloramphenicol.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx028-KanR-del-F with vcrx027-28-del-verif-R; and vcrx027-28-del-verif-F with vcrx028-KanR-del-R.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_R; and 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_R.You can use 1 \u00b5L for each PCR as template DNAThe DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx027-28-del-verif-F and vcrx027-28-del-verif-R.To do so, adjacent 5\u0092 region of vcrx027 was amplified on about 200 bp using vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -R.It uses Chelex beads (available commercially) and heat to extract poor quality DNA for PCR screening only.Our team is sorry about that, but since the cassette will be optimised, we have put more effort on actually improving the cassette than making it Biobrick proof.", "result": "For the right side of the gel, the same clones in the same order were screened for the 3\u0092 end of the insertion with a primer binding in the 5\u0092 of the inserted cassette.We kept clone # 3 for further experiments because it was the one with the lowest background of non-specific amplification.The above gel shows a representative success rate of BBa_K1744000.The result shown above demonstrate that the insertion had a 100% rate of success.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.The success rate of the method is, so far, of 100%.In order to assay the expression of amilCP in single copy, it was inserted through recombineering in lacZ gene in E. coli K-12 substr.The cells were photographed to show the difference between cells with the plasmidic form of amilCP gene and the inserted version of the gene:In this previous image, you can see the appearance of colonies on LB agar when they carry plasmidic or genomic amilCP-KanR cassette.But, with amilCP, the plasmidic background will be eliminated rapidly because the colonies will be deep blue instead of white therefore accelerating the screening and eliminating a good proportion of the background.You can see that only the control exhibits a different amplicon size, and that all clones have the sized band.The presence of a band in the red rectangle means the clone is good.We can see that after 10-12 hours, all the tested clones of mosT recombinants and 1 of the vcrx028 ones started growing even if arabinose was present.This was achieved through PCR screening as described in the experiment section.As it can be seen on the above gel, all of the clone exhibit the correct size band.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.In a recombineering experiment, the longest part if often the screening.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The only thing that is not good about this result is that there is non-specific amplification in all of the clones.The second primer pair (at right) produces a 1.7 kb band if kanR-amilCP was successfully inserted in the genome and a 1.2 kb band if it did not.Therefore, we conclude that vcrx028 is the most fitted counter-selectable marker for our clean deletion system.This section shows the results for pKD4\u0092s cassette insertion in pVCR94 and deletion of vcrx028.In the other hand, it would be unlikely that the predicted band could be non-specific because we screened with two primer pairs for confirmation.For the first series of amplification, the clones were tested for 5\u0092 end of the insertion, with a primer binding in the 3\u0092 of the cassette.It also shows that both mosT and vcrx028 are the most deadly among the tested toxins.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].As you can see, the expression of amilCP in single copy is not sufficient to make the colonies blue even faintly.As you can see, the success rate is really high.The clone order is the same on 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 screening.The first one (at left) produce a 875 bp amplicon if insertion of the part in the genome is successful but no bands if it failed.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].Therefore, no product should be visible if the cassette was not inserted at the right place.Thing is that we restarted the PCR verification multiple times but we could not get rid of the non-specific binding.", "safety": "Of course, like for mechanical tests, we had our glasses on, and, if required, when we were using a reflow-oven, using gloves to manipulate the PCB afterwards.All manipulations implying a living organism have been executed in a certified level 1 biosecurity laboratory.Here are some examples of the biggest safety concerns we had during our project.A standard procedure we followed when testing new mechanical assembly, for examples the platform motion system or the centrifuge plate spinning, we would always wear safety glasses.That way, risk to damage the equipment and ourselves were lower than to run a full speed test right away.When soldering our BananaBoard PCBs, to ensure our safety and proper assembly method, we always used suitable equipment located in a controlled environment.Also, to help detect problems and prevent it, we would start with a low speed test and doing faster tests as the previous was concluding.So, when testing new design for the first time, or trying new things with them, safety was a concern we needed to deal with.For our project, we design a lot of new electrical and mechanical systems.All

momentum.The biochemistry teaching lab technical staff were always there to help us when we (often) needed them.Verkade, Mitchell, and Mulhern helped supervise our lab work.After much deliberation we decided on the StarScaffold and we began to flesh it out.", "background": "", "description": "As a result of this function they\u0092ve been developed extensively for many protein splicing and immobilisation applications[8][9].We have used this property on the arms of our star-like peptide, allowing them to be seamlessly ligated to desired molecules such as enzymes.The arms are able to be ligated to various other molecules such as enzymes, therapeutic molecules, or even each other, and star-like peptides ligated to molecules in such a manner have demonstrated potential applications in areas such as drug delivery, improvement of enzyme kinetics, and novel material design[2][3].The 2014 Melbourne iGEM team designed a novel 4-armed star-like peptide which was intended to be produced and formed largely in vivo using the bacteria E. coli and designed the peptide to contain Magainin 1 antimicrobial peptides on each of the four arms.The overall synthesis mechanism is very similar to the original 2014 peptide, however, the addition of Leucine Zipper domains as well as amino acid sequence optimisation alleviates a key issue of the original peptide, which was the improbability of hairpin loop and disulphide formation[4][5].Our project, StarScaffold, features a new design with several improvements over the 2014 model, most significantly the incorporation of Split Intein motifs on the ends of each arm, as well as amino acid sequence optimisations and inclusion of new protein domains.The addition of Split Inteins importantly allows the formation of highly stable bonds in a specific and controlled manner, giving our molecule significantly improved utility.The StarScaffold is transcribed as a single linear peptide, with Split Inteins in the formation shown.Disulphide bond formation and protease cleavage will then be conducted in vitro under their respective reaction conditions.Inteins are a collection of natural protein splicing domains discovered in the late 20th century, which are able to undergo a self catalysed four step reaction that results in the removal of the intein domains from the host protein and the formation of a native peptide bond between their flanking sequences.The two structures of immediate interest to our team are proteinaceous, permanent hydrogels and enzyme scaffold molecules.The ability of StarScaffold molecules to ligate to each other via split intein interaction potentially allows them to form polymeric protein networks, and we intend to use this property to create a hydrogel composed of repeating subunits of StarScaffold molecules.The use of inteins also allows the star-like peptides to ligate to each other, potentially forming polymeric structures.The StarScaffold is a foundational method of rapid, specific covalent binding and immobilisation of proteins in a fixed or unfixed orientation.In similar but simpler systems rate increases of 77 fold have been seen[12], suggesting the StarScaffold s utility, especially for more complex chemical pathways that might be incompatible with other methods of co-localisation.1.Sulistio, A., Gurr, P. A., Blencowe, A., & Qiao, G. G. (2012).The protein splicing motifs added to each end of the StarScaffold have been chosen for their ability to rapidly and selectively ligate proteins in a high strength fashion.We have created multiple prototypes with varying usage of Leucine Zipper domains to determine optimal formation conditions.The formation of disulphide bonds in E. coli usually takes place within the oxidising environment of the periplasm[6] However, mutant E. coli strains exist which are capable of facilitating disulphide bond formation in the cytoplasm, circumventing this issue[7].Although the peptide was synthesised and extracted, results were ultimately inconclusive.The 2016 iGEM team recognises the enormous potential and applications of star-like peptides, and as a result we decided to continue the work of the 2014 team.The modular nature of our system would allow the physical and biochemical properties of our hydrogel to be easily adjusted by changing star arm length or amino acid composition, or adding specialised ligands, allowing it to avoid many of the aforementioned issues, as well as potentially integrating desirable traits such as biointegration, bioerosion, cargo stabilisation, substrate selectivity, tissue adhesion and intelligent reactivity.TEV protease will then cleave the protein in the middle of the loop, forming the mature star-like peptide.Our project, StarScaffold, deals with star-like peptides, a recently invented class of synthetic proteins [1].Many different Inteins exist, and most Split Inteins from different Inteins do not cross-react[10], allowing us to control which specific arm a given molecule will bind to.Through random movement, the peptide is expected to fold over itself into a hairpin loop.However, given the time constraints for our project, we are currently following a more simplified synthesis pathway where the peptide is expressed in standard E. coli vectors before being extracted in its immature, linear form.Chinese Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 29(8): 734-739.11.Dueber, J. E., Wu, G. C., Malmirchegini, R. G., Moon, T. S., Petzold, C. J., Ullal, A. V., Keasling, J. D.

such that in the parallel confirmation they will disrupt the formation of a hydrophobic core and when in the antiparallel conformation they will align and hydrogen bond each other, stabilising the

University of Melbourne team decided to spread the word of synthetic biology and iGEM to high school and university students, and the general public.We wanted to share our love of synthetic biology with the other science students, and tell them about iGEM and inspire them to join in the future.We wanted to inspire and educate people and encourage the current and future students to be a part of iGEM and secure Melbourne University s  future in the competition.We felt that it was important to target students in their final years of high school.We hoped that hearing about synthetic biology, and exciting extra curricular activities such as iGEM from current students would inspire them to consider a university education particularly in science.The presentations talked about the University experience, iGEM, synthetic biology, and some examples where synthetic biology has been successfully implemented to improve energy production, or health and medicine.It seemed that even at a University, many people were unfamiliar with synthetic biology, even members of our iGEM team admittedly hadn t heard about it prior to getting involved in iGEM.The 2016 team is very passionate about making sure that the University will continue to have an iGEM team in the years to come, and we felt that class presentations was a good way to spread the word.We did talks in the 2nd and 3rd year undergraduate Biochemistry classes, telling them about our project and the many other exciting projects that have been achieved as part of iGEM in the past.Our vision is that the blog will be maintained by future Melbourne University iGEM teams and be a place where teams can interact with the community (followers) and post surveys, videos, and general updates on their progress.The crowd-funding page featured a video describing our project and its applications and raised more than USD$2,000.We also set up a citizen sciences blog on Wordpress (melbourneigem.wordpress.com) to share synthetic biology, biotechnology, and iGEM related news.We wanted to inform the public about synthetic biology, and tell people about our project.", "modeling": "We can therefore define the time constant for Scenario B as:As we go from Scenario A to Scenario B, the reaction rate will increase by a factor of $frac{tau_A}{tau_B}$:frac{tau_A}{tau_B} &= frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-frac{1}{3}}}{v} \times frac{v}{1.633r}\\&= frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-frac{1}{3}}}{1.633r}\\We believe that a useful application for the star peptide is to increase the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway.This can be achieved with two star peptides joined together in conjunction with the enzymes attached to the ends of the arms as illustrated below.As part of our collaboration with NUS Singapore, we asked them to provide us with a diffusion simulator so that we could gain insight into the behaviour of molecules surrounding the star peptides.The raw MATLAB files provided can be downloaded here.The model was set up to mimic the two star peptides illustrated above.Assume:The concentrations of all enzymes and the star peptide are the same in both scenarios and are denoted by the constant $C$The substrates for the enzymes are floating around freely, and their concentration is a non-limiting factorFor a given enzyme concentration of $C$ molar, the mean square displacement (the average length between each enzyme) is:Therefore, define the time constant $\tau_A$ as the average time of an enzyme substrate to diffuse between two enzymes in Scenario A:$$\tau_A = frac{MSD}{v} = frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-frac{1}{3}}}{v}$$Here, $v$ represents the velocity via Brownian motion given by:Assume that the steric interactions between the peptide arms interact so that the average star peptide shape is tetrahedral.Therefore, assuming that all products from enzyme reactions continue flow towards the node where they are being consumed and don t interact with other star peptides, the length the substrates need to travel is $1.633r$.The mass action law multiplied by a factor of $frac{\tau_A}{\tau_B} = 7.23 \times 10^{-10}(frac{1}{rC^{frac{1}{3}}})$ was used in the mevalonate pathway that uses the star peptide.$N_{seg}$: The number of amino acids in a segment, where bonds between segments are random$r_i$: The length of arm i, defined as the Euclidean distance from the centre of the star peptide to the end of the final amino acid of arm $i$Self-avoiding means that once a point on the grid is occupied, it cannot be occupied again.The corresponding normal distribution curve is also plotted.The following is a visualisation of the star peptide s probabilistic diameter.In order to obtain a theoretical relationship between arm length and the number of amino acids on each arm, we shall attempt to analyse the energy of the system.Then, we will aim to compare the average diffusion time between star peptide arms with the average collision time of a normal solution and develop a relationship for the efficiency of the star peptide.This simulator will assist in gauging the behaviour of molecules surrounding the star peptides.In this section we aim to develop a probabilistic model of the length of each arm of the star peptide, based on the number of amino acids in each arm.Using this stochastic model, we can estimate the diffusion time constant between arms of the star peptide via Brownian motion.Our overall goal is to model the reaction kinetics of a solution where enzymes are connected to the star peptide and compare it to the kinetics of when the enzymes are floating freely in the solution.There are a number of assumptions involved that will affect the accuracy of this model:This refers to a random distribution of the bonds connecting amino acids.It is effectively excluding a portion of the total volume.A self-avoiding random walk simulation on a periodic lattice was constructed to visualise the structure of the star peptide.On this page we will be using a range of modelling techniques in order to attempt to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of the star peptide.Firstly, we shall aim to probabilistically determine the shape and structure of the star peptide.Now, assuming the springs obey Hookean dynamics, we will develop a relationship between force applied and extension.$$k_{eff} = frac{1}{frac{1}{2k} + frac{1}{2k}}$$$$E_{total} = frac{3k_B T}{2Na^2} r^2 + frac{k_b T a^3 N^2}{2r^3}$$$$frac{3k_B T}{Na^2} r - 3frac{k_b T a^3 N^2}{2r^4} = 0$$Substituting in values used in simulation ($N_{seg} = 100, a = 1$):$$r = 2^{frac{1}{5}}100^{frac{3}{5}} approx 13.8$$ This theoretical value is slightly larger than the simulated value.The aim of the model was to map the concentration fields of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA as they are produced and consumed at the arms of the star peptides.The following assumptions were used:the concentration of Acetyl-CoA is uniform and not a rate-limiting factorthe initial concentration fields of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA are equal and uniformthe diffusion constants of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA are equalthe rate of conversion of Acetoacetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA at the HMG-CoA Synthase node is dependent upon the concentration of Acetoacetyl-CoA at the nodethe rate of consumption of HMG-CoA at the HMG-CoA Reductase node is dependent upon the concentration of HMG-CoA at the nodeThe adapted NU Singapore MATLAB files for this model can be downloaded here.These concentration fields clearly demonstrate the production and consumption of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA at the relevant nodes.The mass action law was used to model the reaction kinetics of the normal cell.We shall now simulate the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway using the SimBiology toolbox in MATLAB.For the rest of the model, we shall use the empirical value.Obviously there will be complex interactions between the amino acids which will create a very unique protein structure.This is because over a range of amino acids, the bonds will eventually become uncorrelated.We will assume that each arm is the same and thus has the same spring constant.The simulation was run 10,000 times and the following probability distribution for the arm length $r$ was obtained.", "notebook": "Gel electrophoresis of the samples showed a much high percentage of successful colonies.Inoculated

StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised) with a gradient of annealing temperature between 50-60 \u00b0C.Most of the colonies did not have an insert.Some sequences of the pET23a with StarScaffold DNA (Prototype 1, Prototype 2, Non-Seq 1 and Double Helix) were verified.Ligation and transformation of Non-StarScaffold DNA into pSB were aborted as the protein expression with ligated pET23a plasmids had a high priority.Performed PCR with Q5 polymerase on StarScaffold DNA again.Digested the PCR-amplified StarScaffold DNA with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF and then gel purified.Digested pSB1C3 with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF, gel purified and treated with SAP.Prepared pET23a with StarScaffold DNA (Prototype 1, Prototype 2, Non-Seq 1 and Double Helix) for transformation in BL21(DE3) next week.Transformed pET23a

induction.Protein expression of BL21(DE3) were induced by IPTG.They were then plated on LB-CAP plates.Performed colony PCR with VF2 and VR primers on the transformed DH5? colonies (StarScaffold DNA in pSB1C3).Again, most of the colonies did not have an insert.Performed a restriction digest of the purified PCR products of non-StarScaffold DNA with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF, and the PCR-purified.Inoculate the successful colonies (Prototype 1, Prototype 2, Non-Seq 1, Non-Seq 2 and No Helix in pSB1C3) in LB-CAP, miniprep and sequence with VF2 and VR primers.There were issues with staining and destaining procedures again.Performed PCR on the StarScaffold DNA in pSB1C3 with VF2 and VR primers and PCR purified before sending for sequencing.pET23a with StarScaffold DNA was transformed into BL21(DE3) again and plated on LB-AMP agar plate.Gel electrophoresis of the colony PCR indicated that there were some successful DH5? colonies (StarScaffold DNA in pSB1C3).The optimal annealing temperature were 53 \u00b0C and 51 \u00b0C respectively.Transformed the new ligated products (StarScaffold DNA in pET23a) into DH5a and plated on LB-AMP agar.Performed colony PCR of the transformed cells.Gel showed that the best annealing temperature was 51.6 \u00b0C but all samples at different annealing temperature had non-specific amplicons.Performed a touch down PCR in an attempt to reduce non-specific, but it did not succeed.Performed PCR with Q5 polymerase on all StarScaffold and non-StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised).Gel electrophoresis showed no band.Performed another PCR optimisation with the same condition with No Helix StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised) and with a plasmid as a positive control.It is found that the best annealing temperature for the BioBrick prefix and suffix primers was 40.0 \u00b0C when amplifying StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised).Performed PCR optimisation using the BioBrick prefix and suffix primers, Q5 polymerase and No Helix StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised) with a gradient of annealing temperature between 40-60 \u00b0C.Gel showed that most PCR samples did not have non-specific amplicons.All PCR-amplified samples were cleaned with PCR purification.All PCR-amplified-purified DNA (StarScaffold and non-StarScaffold) were digested with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF and cleaned with PCR purification.Digested pSB1C3 with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF and cleaned with PCR purification.Digested and PCR-purified StarScaffold DNA inserts were ligated into digested and PCR-purified pSB1C3 plasmid.Transformed the ligated products (StarScaffold DNA in pSB1C3) into DH5a and plated on LB-AMP agar.BLAST was performed and found that the insert could be from genomic contamination which happened to be of the right size.Ligation of StarScaffold DNA into pSB1C3 was aborted because ligation of StarScaffold DNA into pET23a and subsequently the protein expression have a higher priority.Thinking that genomic contamination could come from the midiprep of pET23a, more pET23a was digested with NotI and NdeI and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP).Performed colony PCR with VF2 and VR primers on the transformed colonies.This may prevent plasmid religation and reduced the change of having colonies without the insert, and also prevent digested genomic contamination from being ligated into the plasmid.Ligated the digested and SAP-treated pET23a with StarScarffold DNA.PCR optimisation using VF2 and VR primers, as well as T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers with known plasmids.Although there were issues with staining and destaining procedures, protein bands were observed with poor resolution.Digested pSB1C3 and StarScaffold DNA from Week 11 were ligated and transformed into DH5? cells.Cells worked very well with DNA >10 ng during transformation.Transformed DH5? with empty pSB1C3 and pET23a plasmids individually and plated them on LB-CAP and LB-AMP agar respectively.They were inoculated into LB-CAP media and then a miniprep was performed.Streak plated empty NEB Shuffle T7 cells on LB agar which will be used for making more competent cells.Inoculated Shuffle T7 cells in LB media, grew to OD 0.6 and chemically treated to make ultra-competent cells.New BL21(DE3) cultures were grown and induced for protein expression at 37 \u00b0C.", "protocol": "", "result": "[[T--Melbourne--7_prototype1.jpg]]Sequencing the pSB-1C3 inserts

parts to the registry.OverviewWe designed the sequence for our novel StarScaffold protein, and chose a set of split inteins which could be used together to join the Scaffolds together (or to link enzymes to the Scaffold)We successfully cloned our StarScaffold genes into E. coli using the pSB-1C3 and pET-23a vectors, and confirmed their size and sequences.Our designed StarScaffold genes were sent to iGEM headquarters as part of the Biobrick registry.We expressed our StarScaffold protein from BL21(DE3) E. coli, and confirmed the protein\u0092s size via SDS-PAGE.Designing the StarScaffoldDrawing our inspiration from the Melbourne 2014 Team\u0092s Star Peptide project, we aimed to utilise the properties of star-shaped proteins.These were then screened with colony PCR to check the size of our inserts, which were further confirmed via sequencing.Using colony PCR, we identified the pET-23a plasmids that had our inserts ligated in, as shown in the gel electrophoresis

colonies identified on the gels above, one colony of each of the 4 variants was grown up and sequenced to confirm that the sequences were correct.In the first stages of our project, we worked on designing the sequences for our StarScaffold protein.We designed sequences for several variants of the StarScaffold, of which four were successfully cloned and sent to the Biobrick registry: our two main Prototype parts, an alternative Double Helix design with lengthened helix domain that may lend itself to better in vivo disulphide formation, and an alternate Non-Sequential design which can be used to test enzyme co-localisation with previously tested inteins.After re-sequencing two more DoubleHelix colonies (as the first one we sequenced carried a mutation), we confirmed that we had correct sequences for these 4 StarScaffold proteins in pET-23a vectors.Sequencing of pET on 160830 pg 116Proto1 (1), proto2 (27), nonseq1 (18), dbhelix (18)Results: all were fine except db helix,

ordered, the first stage in our project was to clone the genes into the plasmid vectors pSB-1C3 and pET-23a for storage and expression, respectively.Whole cell samples were taken both before and after the induction period, and run with SDS-PAGE sample buffer; the gel was then visualised using Coomassie staining.Expected Prototype 1 size: 37kDaNote: we see leaky expression from the T7 promoter.", "safety": "All of which are filed in the laboratory for any member of the team to check as necessary, and detail the need for PPE, a fume hood or other risk management tools.Within our laboratory we always follow some basic laboratory rules including; No running in the laboratory, no eating or drinking, hands must be washed prior to exiting the laboratory, long hair must be tied back and all incidents must be reported to our supervisor.If the E.coli that produces the Starscaffold was to be used outside of a laboratory it would also be necessary to further investigate the potential of the Starscaffold genes to act as a virulence factor and the risk of horizontal transfer of these genes between microbes.Moreover, every team member is inducted into the correct handling of each piece of laboratory equipment before use.To manage the risk to the environment that our genetically modified organisms pose, our laboratory follows the Australian Guidelines.These guidelines also detail the way we transport our bacteria between laboratories, work within our lab and forbid the release of any GMO organisms to the environment.One of the future applications we envision for our project is its use in drug development.To reduce this risk we have all undergone laboratory training and inductions before the use of any equipment.However there is still the risk of injury due to the laboratory

2012)Using the DNA-binding characteristic of the TAL effector, we can generate a new method to increase the production of heterogenous multi-enzymatic reactions in Prokaryotic cells by rationally designed TALE proteins fused with specific enzymes and their corresponding DNA sequences (as known as Binding Motifs [BMs]).And that mutation may disable the whole reporter gene.In order to meet this challenge and make this part easier to use, we designed a pair of prime to remove that additional base and make this part easier to be used.In our project, after properly engineered those two parts, we fused them with the TAL effectors we designed and tested their function.In our experiment, GFP1 was fused with TALE1, GFP2 was fused with TALE2; and SCAF2 (a scaffold where TALE protein can bind) was added into the plasmid.TAL effector nuclease (TALEN) technique is based on the specific and direct combination between DNA and proteins, thus gives us a clue that the compartmentation of multi-enzymes can be achieved based on TALE fused enzymes and corresponding DNA scaffold.TAL effector (TALE) is a family-III effector in Xanthomonas that helps when they infect various plant species [7].Thus, enzymes fused with TALE proteins could be gathered around the DNA scaffolds, enrich the local enzyme concentration, and promote the rate of reaction.Fig.2 A diagrammatic sketch showing the TALE-fused enzymes combine with the scaffold.In our project, we plan to fuse the N-terminal of GFP (A.K.A.Among the registry, BBa_K515100 is the only one available with those two enzymes, but unfortunately, we noticed that this part is a device that contains not only the CDS of those two enzymes but also other parts, and neither of the CDS of those two enzyme were submitted to the registry (they were only registered as BBa_K515000 and K515001).In the current study, we developed a new method to accelerate a multi-enzymatic reaction by integration of a transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-based scaffold system into the bacteria chassis.Compared with strain without basic scaffold D0, IAA output with D0 resulted in a 1.4 fold increase (The result was permitted to be used by the team advisor of ZJU_CHINA 2012).This year in our project, we made an improvement to that system by changing the RNA scaffold system into our TALE-based scaffold system.The result showed a 3.2 fold increase for the TALE1-IAAM/TALE2-IAAH S2 system and a 2.5 fold increase for the TALE1-IAAM/TALE2-IAAH S3 system compared to strain without scaffold S2/S3.[1]C.However, lacking of in vivo compartmentation of the heterologous metabolic pathways, which results in a relevantly low concentration of substrate and enzyme, may cause a low production or productive efficacy, especially when producing through a complex multi-enzymatic cascade.1.5 to 33.5 tandem repeats (TAL repeats), each of which can recognize one specific DNA base pair, were determined in the central DNA binding domain of the TALEs [8,9].However, lacking of the compartmentation of the heterologous metabolic pathways, which result in a relevantly low concentration of substrate and enzyme, may cause a low production or productive efficacy, especially when producing through a complex multi-enzymatic cascade.The effect of the TALE-based scaffold system were tested by the fragmented GFP study and validated by the heterologous production of ndole-3-acetic acid (IAA), is a plant hormone, through incorporating the TALE-fused tryptophan-2-mono-oxygenase (A.K.A.Other methods of engineering TAL effectors acting as transcriptional effectors were also reported.Fig.1 (A) The basic structure of TAL effectors.To fix this, we designed a pair of primers to add a termination codon on the 3\u0092 terminal of BBa_I715019 to further extend its usage.When fusing the GFP2 with our TALE2/3, we found the additional T base on the 5\u0092 terminal of the BBa_I715020 annoying because it may cause frameshift mutation if we just use the standard Bio-brick assembly to fuse two enzymes.For years, this problem has been bothering researchers in further enlarging the applications of prokaryotic cells in bio-engineering.Hence, multiple manners have been designed to accelerate the multi-enzymatic reactions in prokaryotic cells by physically enriching the local concentration of enzymes and substrates in certain areas of the cell.Unfortunately, it is difficult for the DNA scaffold to assemble as single-stranded loop-stem structure to bind the ligadin in vivo.Meanwhile, the complex structure of the scaffold proteins made it inconvenient for prokaryotic biofactory to correctly fold them, thus limits the application.Description: Engineering of a multi-enzymatic reaction accelerator in vivo based on TALETIPS2: The right NAVIGATE :) posites on content in this page.However, the sample of BBa_I715019 provided by the 2015 DNA distribution does not have a termination codon on its 3\u0092 terminal to stop the translation.Accordingly, a recent report applied CRISPER-CAS9 technique as a scaffold system that concentrates specific enzymes for metaplastic functions[6].Subsequently, multi-enzymes were fused with these TALE proteins, which could efficiently guide the enzymes around the DNA scaffolds, to enrich the local enzyme concentration, and promote the rate of reaction.A plasmid backbone was used as the scaffold for those BMs.Different TALEs share a similar domain structure that enables them to bind the genome of the host cell and act as transcriptional effectors.Meanwhile, the different TALE proteins, which could specifically target the corresponding binding motifs, were generated by the assembly of repeat-variable di-residue (RVD) part coding sequences.demonstrated a method to increase the hydrogen production of a heterogenous hydrogen-producing pathway in vivo with rationally designed RNA assemblies[1].In this system, we designed two different random DNA sequences as binding motifs, and then incorporated them into the plasmid.Thus, several improvements were made based on the part K515100 to provide an available version of IAAM and IAAH.Two pairs of primes were designed to decompose this device and gain the CDS of IAAM and IAAHIn the project of ZJU_CHINA 2012, the IAA producing pathway originates from Pseudomonas savastanoi was engineered into E.coli.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report using TALE system as scaffolds for the spatial organization of bacterial metabolism.(Valid when UNFOLDED)For years, prokaryotic cells have been widely applied in synthetic biology and bio-engineering as the host organism.Nevertheless, the limited corresponding ligadin as well as the fragility of RNA itself is challenging the expansibility and stability of such method, which may constrain its further application.However, since the binding between different dCas9-fused proteins and gRNA is relevantly nonspecific, the expandability of such method is still limited.Notably, the recent developed genome editing technique (such as ZFN, TALEN, CRISPER-CAS9), can exactly meet this requirement and come up with clues for new scaffold systems.By physically fusing the TAL effector with the cleavage domain of FokI nucleases, TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) can be created.Mo, its application might be extend to the eukaryotic biofactory as well.Prokaryotic cells have been widely applied as the host cells in bio-engineering and relevant fields for years due to their great advantages in high-speed growth and high productivities against the Eukaryotic Cells.Elsewhere, DNA and proteins have also been tried to be modified as scaffold for similar use [3-5] .Therefore, both of these two scaffold methods remained limited to in vitro applications.Given the importance of developing an in vivo scaffold system that is natural, highly-stable, expandable and simple, a large body of work sought to establish a new method that provokes efficient interaction among different biomacromolecules in vivo.In this prototype, enzyme IAAM and IAAH are fused with different TAL effector so that they can be concentrated around the scaffold.*0.01 < p < 0.05.The results shows that the existence of GFP1 and GFP2 can observably increase the fluorescent intensity.1 Evaluation of the functions of split GFP.J. Moscou, A. J. Bogdanove, A simple cipher governs DNA recognition by TAL effectors.The green fluorescence (Ex: 488 nm; Em: 538 nm) of split GFP was detected after overnight culture of E.coli with or without GFP1/2 under the 1mM of IPTG induction.More recently, similar methods were applied in vivo on acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) [2].A.

Based on the scaffold we designed, we engineered three different TAL effectors, namely TALE1 (T1), TALE2 (T2) and TALE3 (T3) TALE3 can specifically recognize the REVERSED sequence of BM2: 5\u0092-CTTTCCACAAATAG-3\u0092NJU_CHINA finished the construction of our first TAL effector (TALE1) and edited the vectors provided by the kit (adding corresponding cutting sites to be specific) to meet the RFC10 bio-brick standard.With their help, we finished the construction of the rest of the TALEs by ourselves using the Golden Gate TALEN and TAL Effector Kit 2.0 by Addgene(R).Specifically, due to the nonspecific interaction between enzyme-fused dCas9 proteins and gRNA, different engineered dCas9 proteins have to compete for gRNA, thus makes the scaffold system unpredictable and uncontrollable.The TALEN technique is based on the direct interaction between TALE protein and the target DNA sequence.The length of DNA BMs and intervening sequences is designed based on the typical in vivo B-type DNA structure, and the structural basis for TALEs targeting DNA.By integrating the coding sequences of the TALE-fused proteins and the scaffold, two different plasmids can be constructed.Accordingly, three different scaffolds were designed to figure out the influence of the spatial orientation and hindering effect on the effectiveness of the scaffold system.1.Among those techniques, ZFN is now being gradually replaced by TALEN and CRISPER-CAS9, and its binding mechanism with DNA is similar to TALEN by the view of molecular biology; CRISPER-CAS9 technique is based on the specific recognition of the gRNA and the target DNA, as well as the relevantly nonspecific interaction between CAS-family protein and gRNA.As mentioned in our project description, different TALEs share a similar domain structure that enables them to bind the genome of the host cell and act as transcriptional effectors.By engineering those structures, we can build proteins that can bind with any DNA sequence that we desire.In our project, we designed two different DNA binding motifs (DNA BMs).This enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of indoleacetamide to indoleacetate and ammonia.This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative carboxylation of L-tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide.Thus, the current development of genome editing technique may give us a clue by achieving those requirements spontaneously.ZFN, TALEN and CRISPER-CAS9 are three famous genome editing techniques nowadays.The protocol can be reached at [PDF]TAL effector construction.Split GFP is a technique that has been widely used in the research of protein-protein interaction.SCAF3 or S3) is designed to test the effect of different length of intervening sequence.", "human_practice": "Your project is more like a

but the ethanol is nonpolar molecule, the DNA can\u0092t be dissolved.In this simplified DNA extract process, the adding of detergent is to crush the cells because there are some phosphatide on the cell membrane.After pinch the strawberry, the cell will be broken and the contains will get out.This time in our project, this platform was applied to run our mathematical model, thus brought us advantages in the accuracy of our model.After the detergent has dissolved them, the surface of the cell will be full of little holes.3.After adding the ethanol, the DNA will precipitate out.I think what restricts the development of the pharmaceutical industry is the disorder of reaction.In other word, the type and output of productions can be controlled.We all know that, in recent years, bio-pharmaceutical security has been subject to the general interest.syndetic biology is everywhere if only you have the love of science!This song is adapted from the Snow Globe of Matt Wertz, please indicate the source when reship it.However, your project will not only increase the reaction efficiency but also make the reaction ordered.So we hope we can gain an objective and comprehensive assessment of our project and are eager for valuable advice through this interview.Moring Dr. Jiang!TIPS2: The right NAVIGATE :) posites on content in this page.We ve learned that the Experimental Animal Center are already passed the identification of United States AAALAC Certification Center on safety evaluation of drugs.I believe it will have a positive influence on the development of the pharmaceutical industry.If it leads to an acceleration of cell metabolism, it may eventually make the cell cancerous or autophagy.Increasing reaction rate may result an accumulation of intermediate products which cause side effects.", "modeling": "So, the scaffold can improve the multi-enzyme reaction efficiency.However, when the distance between enzyme sites to a extent, the scaffold can aggregate enzymes enough tight, the advantage of scaffold will disappear.1.Thus, the scaffold design improves the reaction efficiency.Analysis: The distance between enzyme sites is enlarged on.The substrates and intermediate products can overlap the enzyme and scaffold spot which can simulate the combination during reaction process.The demo of the reactant motion and interaction (First 30 time units in 3000 time units)Every collision (overlap) between reactant and enzyme is effective as long as the they match.Thus, the scaffold design improves the reaction efficiency.Analysis: The distance between enzyme sites is larger than group1.The core idea is to calculate reaction rate parameters using time driven stochastic simulation method, and compare these parameters of the TALE-based scaffold system and the none-scaffold system.Furthermore, the effect of the multi-enzyme sites on scaffold is studied.The models to study reaction efficiency are based on reaction molecular dynamics.Differently, the scaffold design and none-scaffold design have similar reaction efficiency.Analysis: The multi-enzyme reaction series increases than that above.With the multi-enzyme reaction series increasing, the effect of the scaffold is brought out.3.So, the substrates are consumed in nearly same speed.While because the scaffolds aggregate the enzymes, when the intermediate products try to collide with the second enzyme, it tends to consume less time between collision with enzyme.In other words, in this article, the stochastic simulation method is applied to calculate and assess scaffold system and none-scaffold system parameters in the form of probability distributions.The stochastic simulation starts from COLLISION while the Michaelis-Menten equation basic on the CONCENTRATION.But the effect of the scaffold is more obvious than that above.With the distance between different enzymes sites on one scaffold enlarging, the the effect of the scaffold decreasing.It has same probability between scaffold and none-scaffold design.With the distance between different enzymes sites on one scaffold enlarging, the the effect of the scaffold decreasing.The different enzymes of (b) are linked by scaffold and the scaffold are independently dispersed while those in (c) are independently dispersed.The simulation aims at comparing the scaffold and none-scaffold effect and studying the sites position (on scaffold) effect.And every reaction can be finished instantaneously as long as the collision happened.The smaller blue dots are substrates and the larger blue and red dots are different enzyme.Therefore, the Michaelis-Menten equation is improper to simulate the scaffold \u0093aggregation\u0094 effect where the reactant is UNEVEN.Stochastic simulation can directly calculate the behavior of every reactant molecule, which can simulate scaffold \u0093aggregation\u0094 effect.But, similarly, the substrates are consumed in nearly same speed.And the enzyme sites are fixed on scaffolds.The simulation is on two dimension.But the density of reactants, enzyme is relatively near to the real condition.Note1: Return to V.Parameter Setting to see detailed parameter of the group below.Analysis: Although the substrates are consumed in similar speed.The motion of substrates and intermediate products is the composition of the cyclosis and random thermal motion.However, although the Michaelis-Menten equation is derived from the collision behavior characteristics, it presumes that the reactant is UNIFORMLY dispersed in the reaction space and the COLLISION EQUALS CONCENTRATION.when the substrate collision with the first enzyme.So the reactants, enzyme quantities cell diameter are smaller than the E.coli.The TALE-based scaffold system can improve the multi-enzyme reaction efficiency.2.(Valid when UNFOLDED)This model tries to prove theoretically the TALE-based scaffold system can improve the multi-enzyme reaction efficiency.Considering our limited time, equipment and abilities, we adopted the simplifying assumptions below.The involved objects are E.coli, reactants, scaffold and enzymes (on or off scaffolds).", "notebook": "We

Schematic representations of the integration manner of split GFP to TALE-DNA scaffold system and their hypothetical binding patterns to DNA motifs.(B) Schematic representations of the integration manner of IAAM and IAAH to TALE-DNA scaffold system and their hypothetical binding patterns to DNA motifs.Notably, RT-PCR analysis showed that the increase of IAA production in scaffold system was not owing to the expression variation of IAAM and IAAH (Fig.By sandwich ELISA analysis, both of the scaffold harboring groups showed significantly higher production of IAA than the no scaffold control group (>3.2 fold of TALE1-IAAM/TALE2-IAAH-Scaffold2 and >2.5 fold of TALE1-IAAM/TALE2-IAAH-Scaffold3, p < 0.01, Fig.According to these results, it could be demonstrated that the TALE-DNA scaffold system can effectively increase the IAA production through an IAAM-IAAH metabolic pathway.Notably, according to the RT-PCR analysis, the increase of the green fluorescence in scaffold system was not owing to the expression variation of split GFP (Fig.Evaluation of the TALE-DNA scaffold system by split GFP assay.ChIP-PCR assay of TALE-GFP binding to the scaffold in E.coli.Antibodies used for

TALE-GFP1/2 fusion protein can effectively target the binding motifs on plasmid DNA scaffold, the ChIP-PCR analysis was conducted.(C) The production of IAA was determined by sandwich ELISA after overnight culture of E.coli with IPTG induction.To optimize the culture temperature upon IPTG induction, TALE1-GFP1-Scaffold1 system was used as representative for the ChIP-PCR assay.(B) The green fluorescence (Ex: 488 nm; Em: 538 nm) of split GFP was detected after overnight culture of E.coli with or without IPTG induction.The cDNA sequence of 16S rRNA was amplified as standard.To investigate the function of TALE-DNA scaffold system in heterologous metabolic pathway, we use a prototype of IAA synthetic pathway by fusing the IAAM and IAAH enzymes to two different TALEs (TALE1 and TALE2, Fig.These findings suggest that TALE-DNA scaffold system might be an efficient device for the compartmentation and ordering of different proteins fused with TALE proteins.Figure 2.(A) The IAA production pathway converts L-Trp into IAA through IAAM and IAAH.In parallel, the data of FI/OD600 in TALE1-GFP1/TALE2-GFP2-Scaffold2 and TALE1-GFP1/TALE2-GFP2-Scaffold3 groups was significantly higher than that of no scaffold2/3 control.Because the binding motifs of TALEs are containing highly repeated sequences, and their flanking sequences are also homologous to the other parts of the harboring plasmid, the primers used for ChIP-PCR were forward P1 and reverse P2 for GFP1 amplification, and forward P3 and reverse P4 for GFP2 amplification, respectively (Fig.These results indicate that TALE-GFP1/2 can specifically binds to the corresponding plasmid DNA binding motifs in vivo.Figure 1.(B) Exploration of the optimal temperature of E.coli culture for ChIP-PCR assay.As shown in Fig

with UnaG.As part of this iGEM project, research has been done on the newly discovered green fluorescent protein called UnaG.This is the first fluorescent protein to be found in a vertebrate species, giving it a range of biochemical properties that differs from proteins found in the original FP family - one of the most astounding ones being that fluorescence occurs only when a ligand binds non-covalently to the protein, namely bilirubin.Induction of fluorescence of UnaG by the addition of bilirubin.Instead of binding a fatty acid molecule, the ligand of UnaG is bilirubin, which binds non-covalently to the center of this \u00df barrel.During the summer we created three different UnaG biobricks; one with a hexahistidine tag suitable for affinity chromatography, one with the hexahistidine tag and a flexible linker of six amino acids suitable for fusing to other proteins, and lastly one biobrick with only the flexible linker attached to UnaG.This feature could make UnaG suitable as an inducible marker by the addition and removal of bilirubin to cells.In addition to the affinity tag, the original sequence was also modified to include C-terminal flexible linker (GSG)2 in case the protein would be part of a fusion construct.Secondly, it fluoresces only when a bilirubin molecule is bound non-covalently to the protein.The binding buffer for UnaG contains 10 mM imidazole, the washing buffer (to remove the excess protein from the column) contains 20 mM imidazole and the elution buffer contains 350 mM imidazole.This does not interfere with 3A assembly, but a variant of the BioBrick without the flexible linker also exists.IDT sequenced the entire pUCIDT-Amp vector including the ordered insert as part of their quality control workflow, so their results were used as a reference when doing modification to the plasmid.The IDT plasmid contains the lac-promoter so it is possible to do test expression directly with IPTG.UnaG has shown the ability of being fused to other proteins via a flexible linker both on the C terminus and the N terminus, making it suitable to use as a fusion marker.At each step of the experiments, sequencing was performed using the iGEM standard VF2 and VR verification primers to ensure CDS integrity and especially to avoid introduced frameshift mutations.In addition to mutagenesis experiments, small-scale expression tests were performed to verify that UnaG expresses under our laboratory conditions (Kumagai et.al (2013) purified and crystalized the protein from E.coli, so in theory it should be functional in prokaryotes).In the original paper (Kumagai et al., 2013) the authors obtained the UnaG sequence from a cDNA library of unagi eel muscle.The result of the degradation are two toxic compounds; carbon monoxide (CO) and the bilirubin, were as it is only the carbon monoxide that is possible for the body to excrete easily (Mugnoli et al.The pigment also has the ability to conjugate with three types of proteins that are involved in the transport and the metabolism of bilirubin in vivo (Bonnett et al.In addition, none of the fractions fluoresced when bilirubin was added.Since sequencing confirmed that there are no mutations, and we previously managed to obtain impure functioning UnaG during the small-scale experiments of UnaG, the conclusion was that the IPTG solution was faulty and did not manage to induce the T7 promoter driven UnaG expression.Moreover, unlike all other fluorescent proteins of today, UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, meaning that it can be used as a marker protein in research under hypoxic conditions.1976).Hyperbilirubinemia, also called Jaundice disease or icterus (www.mesh.kib.ki.se), occurs when either the formation of bilirubin glucuronides or the excretion of these does not work in the correct manner.After successfully obtaining UnaG assembled with a variety of promoters, mutagenesis was performed in order to create several variants of the BioBrick for future use.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0140972 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco) created by the enzymatic reaction of haemoglobin degradation.There is a slight blue shift in the fluorescence (UnaG is 498/527 nm ex/em and Chlopsid FPI and FPII 489/523 nm ex/em).These contains two glucuronic acids per bilirubin molecule and the compound seems to simply be an effect of bilirubin\u0092s three dimensional structure.One chain of glucuronic acid is enough to make the bilirubin excretable, but diglucoronides can also occur in the human bile.However due to the way the final product is created, the UnaG sequence had a 50% chance to be incorporated in reverse, which was the case.(I)Since UnaG was discovered fairly recently, no mutagenic variations of the protein have been developed with improved characteristics than those of wtUnaG.Consequently the concentration of bilirubin and glucuronic acid accumulates in the body (Buchan, 1826).After the column is equilibrated with ion binding buffer, the buffer it switched out with 0.3 M NiSO4 and a new equilibration step is made with 5 CV\u0092s of ion solution.According to Akiko Kumagai and his team, the quantum yield of holo-UnaG is 0.51 and it is stable in a pH ranging from 4 to 11 (I).UnaG does not seem to be present in any of the fractions 1-7.Afterwards 5 CV of wash buffer is pumped through to remove of all the excess protein still in the column.UnaG is a fluorescent protein that was recently discovered in eel muscle (Anguilla japonica).Since the glucoronic acid contains several COOH- and OH-groups the bilirubin conjugate becomes more hydrophilic than the bilirubin alone.The column is equilibrated with 5 CV of binding buffer, afterward 25 ml of the binding buffer is mixed with the UnaG lysate and loaded onto the column.The researchers suggest that this blue shift stems from the fact that the 57th amino acid in UnaG is asparagine, whereas Chlopsid FPI and FPII contain a histidine at this site.Bilirubin exists in all vertebrates and is a metabolite of the heme group in hemoglobin.Annotations: 2_3F - UnaG under a

(control)bilirubin - 1mM bilirubin solution in DMSO (control)After observing the small-scale expression results, plans for large-scale purification were designed.All of the fractions were then tested for the target protein using SDS-PAGE.Common properties for these compounds, among which bilirubin is included, is that they can diffuse through biological membranes in the placenta, blood brain barrier and hepatocytes.After centrifugation at 4\u00b0C and 10 000 g for 1 hour, the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 \u00b5M pore filter and loaded to a Ni2+ affinity column, also called IMAC.Alignment of the DNA sequences of UnaG and the Chlopsid proteins show 54% homology.In fact, BR is the actual fluorophore of UnaG.This part has been designed for studying the properties of the protein in vivo, since the high positive charge of the affinity tag could interfere with its function or localization.Upstream of it lies a 6xHis affinity tag, separated by an additional Serine amino acid to increase flexibility between the tag and the protein.When BR binds to the cavity of the protein, it emits green light at 527 nm.Since the haemoglobin is located inside the red blood cells, the protein is hidden from the catabolism.Downstream of the part lies a short Glycine-rich flexible linker to minimize the effects of possible protein fusion.(2015) Adaptive Evolution of Eel Fluorescent Proteins from Fatty Acid Binding Proteins Produces Bright Fluorescence in the Marine Environment.This is part retains all the features, including the RFC25 prefix and suffix, but now the flexible linker is properly expressed and in case of fusing to another CDS would not cause premature termination.Finally, to avoid potential interference from the 6xHistidine affinity tag, BBa_K2003012 was created based on BBa_K2003011.After staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destaining, the band corresponding to UnaG\u0092s expected size (15.6 kDa) was not observed anywhere.The isolation and characterization of bilirubin diglucuronide, the major bilirubin conjugate in dog and human bile.These cool features, alongside the fact that it is always exciting to work with new discoveries, made us want to add this protein to the iGEM toolbox!The UnaG sequence itself was excised from the IDT plasmid using EcoRI and PstI and ligated into pSB1C3 backbone cut with the same set of enzymes.(I)UnaG is a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP).Thereby it becomes possible for the bilirubin to leave the liver and go along with the bile, through the kidneys and then finally get excreted with the urine.In this part, the six amino acids were removed (again through PCR), as well as the Serine linker in between.is almost never present (if so the molecule would have been directly polar and lipophilic) (Mugnoli et al.An exception is an NsiI site in the N-terminal 6xHis tag, but a BioBrick without it was also made.The human being\u00b4s survival is dependent on the monoglucuronides, but not on the diglucuronides (Gordon et al.This protein is interesting firstly because it is about half the size of other fluorescent proteins that are being used today, making it suitable as a fusion protein.In the registry it is annotated as BBa_K2003010.It is only when the exchange into new red blood cells takes its place that the haemoglobin becomes exposed and decomposed by either fagocytosis or haemolysis.1985).Bilirubin is naturally excreted in the liver by, with the help of enzymes, conjugating with the sugar glucoronic acid to create glucuronides.The structure of bilirubin.Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.The molecule has a tendency to form several derivate of bilirubin such as biliproteins, several conjugates and glucuronides etc (Harris, Kellermeyer, 1970).The results verify that UnaG does not fluoresce in absence of bilirubin.Afterwards the column had to be charged with Ni2+ this is done with a ion binding buffer (50 mM Na+CH3COO-, 300 mM NaCl, pH4).This discovery suggests possibilities of changing the emission wavelength of these proteins by mutagenesis comparableto what has been done on GFP for the past 40 years.They contribute to the transport of lipophilic compounds, often fatty acids.To avoid unspecific fluorescence, cell debris were pelleted before the experiment and small aliquots of the supernatant were added to 200 \u00b5L thin-walled PCR tubes.Figure 1.No other fluorescent protein has a ligand that binds non-covalently to it.Therefore suites of different BioBrick promoters were extracted from the 2016 distribution to test for expression.No indications that the diglucuronides are more biological efficient have been noticed so far.It originates from the muscle fibers of the Japanese Unagi eel Anguilla japonica.Even at the pH-values where the COOH-group is in an ionic state the formation of Figure 1C is predominant.In these forms the pigment creates several hydrogen bonds between the NH/O-groups and OH/-groups, which in turn makes the hydrophilic COOH- and NH-groups not available for polar interaction with their environment.The bilirubin molecules have a tendency to create different complexes with other proteins as well, such as serum albumin.Bilirubin does not exist naturally in lower classes of organisms such as bacteria and yeast, so it would have to be added exogenously when research is being done on these types of cells.Bilirubin can only bind to UnaG in its unconjugated (4Z,15Z) form, meaning that wild-type UnaG shows high specificity to this particular molecule.Comparison in different species of biliary bilirubin-IX? conjugates with the activities of hepatic and renal bilirubin-IX?-uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases.The Effect of pH on Green Fluorescent Protein: a Breef Review.The bilirubin is difficult to excrete since it is a non-polar compound and therefor not soluble in water (Fevery, J et al.High levels of bilirubin are toxic and it can result in neurologic harm that causes deafness, delayed development and cerebral pares (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco).UnaG is a \u00df barrel structure containing eleven \u00df strands - a typical quality for FABPs.Consequently the bilirubin becomes insoluble in water and methanol, but easy to dissolve in chloroform (Mugnoli et al.Chlopsid FPI and FPII are also bilirubin inducible.Note that this part is designed with RFC25 (Freiburg Standard) prefix and suffix in mind, hence it contains additional restriction sites, that do not affect normal 3A assembly but enable in-frame protein fusion without creating stop codons.is present when bilirubin is in liquid and solid constellations (Le Bas, Allegret, et al.Structure of bilirubin IX? (isopropylammonium salt) chloroform solvate, C33H34N4O62?.2C3H10N+.2CHCl3.Acta Crystallographica Section C Crystal Structure Communications,39(9), 1287-1291. doi:10.1107/S0108270183008252Karolinska institutet, https://mesh.kib.ki.se/term/D007567/jaundice-neonatal, Retreived 2016-08-11.Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco.Bilirubin is not very soluble in water, so the stock 1mM solution was prepared in DMSO instead.Breaking open the cells was performed using Qsonica Q700 titanium-tip sonicator since lysozyme has nearly the same size as UnaG and would make purification more difficult, as well as just slower and less efficient compared to sonication.Kumagai, A., Ando, R., Miyatake, H., Greimel, P., Kobayashi, T., Hirabayashi, Y., Shimogori, T., and Miyawaki, A.UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, making it suitable for research executed under anaerobic conditions where FPs are not functional.(III)(I) Kumagai, A. Ando, R. Miyatake, H. Greimel, P. Kobayashi, T. Hirabayashi, Y. Shimogori, T. Miyawaki, A.Those include a medium constitutive promoter (BBa_K608006), a strong constitutive promoter (BBa_K880005), IPTG inducible promoter (BBa_J04500), and a T7 promoter (BBa_K525998).", "design": "The feature area is where channels can be placed and is the part of the design which will actually be translated into a PDMS chip.The total running length of the heat shock channel is 2.276 cm and the part of the heating channel which runs parallel with the heat shock channel is 1.41 cm.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the electroporation chip.However there were still some problems with warping (about one out of four turned out to be good), so we went back to the drawing board to create our finalized design.The basic design is a box which is 2.2x3.3x2.5 cm.The heat shock channel itself is 300 \u00b5m wide at its thin part and 800 \u00b5m wide at the broader parts, it is 500 \u00b5m high in all parts.Early in the summer it was decided that we would primarily work toward creating a functional chip for heat shock, and if there was time to make a electroporation chip and design an incubation feature/chip.The running channels in the electroporation chip are 200 \u00b5m across and 100 \u00b5m high, while the \u0093channels\u0094 where the electrodes are supposed to be placed are 200x200 \u00b5m.The electroporation chip was designed, printed and assembled but there was not enough time to test the transformation capabilities of the design, mainly due to difficulties in getting the electroporation electrodes firmly and correctly attached to the chip.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the heat shock chip.A schematic view of the heat shock chip can be seen in Figure 2.The feature area is 1.6x3.0 cm on the finalized designs.The inlet channel for the cell suspension is 500 \u00b5m wide and 100 \u00b5m high.Size-wise, these were about 2/3rds of the chip in Fig.This design paradigm was quickly scrapped mainly due to the moulds (and therefore the chips) easily becoming warped during the curing process.The chip in Figure 1 is about 7x3 cm (slightly larger than a microscrope slide).Figure 1: Early design: Easily made and easily warped.Smaller, thicker rectangles.We went over several iterations of designs until we settled on the box designs.The resistor which we added is theorized to produce longer and larger droplets, since these scale with the length of the outlet channel.The total distance that the liquid travels inside the resistor is 103.4 mm or about 10 cm.", "human_practice": "To make an example this manual is made specifically for heat shock transformation, but the design of the chip can be altered to fit any other purpose.When we wrote the manual we wanted it to fit the needs of smaller laboratories that might lack all the necessary equipment and prior knowledge.As a part of Human Practices we decided to develop a manual for manufacturing a microfluidic chip for heat shock transformation.After a short discussion concerning intellegent property and the writing of a contract, our files containing the design of the chip, as well as the manual while it was under progress we re sent to them.The Biohackers at Makerspace are going to test our manual in practice in the near future and we look forward to see the results from our manual and manufacturing method being used.The manual covers the full manufacturing process for a microfluidic chip based on a 3D-printed mold.The collaboration with Makerspace gave us important feedback and lead to an overall improvement of the manual.", "modeling": "The flow rate of the inlets was set to a laminar inflow with average velocity of 10 cm/s and the outlets was set to open.The initial temperature of the whole chip was set 25\u00b0C and the initial value of the velocity field was set to 0 everywhere in the channels.Fig3: Simulation progress after 0.02, 3, 5 and 10 sThe results of modelling the heat shock system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.We decided to model our design for the electroporation chip so that we could test out different designs of the chip and view the effects of changing parameters such as flow rate and channels size.Modeling the heat distribution over time in the heat transformation chip circumventedthe technical problems of measuring the temperature inside the channel which proved to be very complicated due to the small dimensions of the channels and a lack of equipment.The main goal of the model was to determine if the structure we designed would be able to generate droplets with our intended values for the flow rate of a dispersible phase, an oil phase, and a continuous phase, cell solution.In our case, we were not able to measure the exact temperature of the cell channel inside our heat shock chip.To set up the simulation we choose time dependent study and the conjugated heat transfer interface which is used to simulate the coupling between heat transfer and fluid flow.That is, your actual values may not be exactly like those shown in the model but the model can give you a good picture of what is going on inside the chip.For the electroporation model we decided to focus on a liquid/liquid interface system as these are generally easier to model and drew the T-junction in COMSOL and assigned correct materials, PDMS, oil and water.The mesh is necessary because COMSOL uses the finite element method, a numerical approach where the problem is divided into smaller parts, \u0093elements\u0094, to calculate difficult partial differential equation systems.After generating the mesh the initial values and the boundary conditions of the problem was set.This means that higher flow rates require a finer mesh and smaller time step in order for the solver to converge.The results of modeling the electroporation system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.This is a good approximation for viscous fluids.The boundary of the chip to the surrounding was set to a constant temperature of 25\u00b0C andthe boundary condition of the two inlets was set to a constant temperature of 65\u00b0C to simulate a constant inflow of 65\u00b0C water.With the help of a COMSOL simulation, we could see the heat spreading in PDMS.A mesh was generated of the drawn chip using the inbuilt mesh generating feature with the parameters set to physics-controlled mesh and element size finer.For these reasons, models are a good method of acquiring knowledge about the details of your chip, especially the details that are difficult to measure.Finally an outlet was placed at the end of the main channel.One important aspect of designing the heat shock chip was to determine how heat dissipated in the chip.The initial flow rate for both phases was set to 0 as the two phases flow rate are defined under the inlet panel for each channel inlet.The heat equation of the fluid was coupled with the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow.The geometry of the model was built in COMSOL and the domains of the geometry was assigned material specific attributes from the library like heat capacity etc.We focused on modelling the T-junction where the continuous fluid acts on an orthogonal channel with incoming dispersible fluid, leading to droplet generation.In fig 4 the geometry of the t-junction is shown as seen in COMSOL with a blue line representing the initial liquid/liquid interface.Fig4: Geometry of t-junction with initial line liquid/liquid interfaceThe wetting conditions of the walls was set to no slip conditions.The boundary conditions was set to laminar inflow and the average velocity for the continuous phase: 100 nl/min and dispersible phase: 100 nl/min.Droplet formation is thought to occur as a combination of shear stress on the dispersible fluid and a pressure drop when the dispersible fluid droplet has almost filled the entire cross section of the channel.Lastly a \u0093coarser\u0094 mesh was generated with corner refinement around the edges where the orthogonal channel(dispersible phase channel) meets the main channel (continuous phase channel).This was important in order to know if the cells are actually being heat shocked, and at what temperature.By testing a virtual chip system we get both fast and detailed information that is helpful when deciding on the actual parameters of the physical chip.The entrance length can be calculated from the formula 4A/P were A is the cross sectional area of the channel and P the circumference.This method is accurate but also has a high computational cost making it ideal for microfluidics applications where the number of droplets needed to be tracked are few.Generally interface tracking uses a fixed mesh to calculate how the interface changes between two phases.Therefore depending on the interface type, gas/liquid or liquid/liquid, the final model had to be changed to meet the requirement for each type.This structure is critical as the size of the droplets and their flow rate after formation will determine how well the cells is being transformed.It uses the regular heat equation for the heat transfer in solids and the heat equation for fluids that accounts for energy transport due to flow, heat from pressure work and viscous effects that produce fluid heating.The properties for the surface tension was defined by a liquid/liquid system and the library value for the olive oil/water surface tension coefficient was used.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "As a proof of concept we did 2 rounds of experiments on our heat shock chip, one where we compared its transformation efficiency to that of regular heat shock transformation done off-chip and one where we compared transformation efficiency on the chip at different temperatures.During the summer we made over 30 chips and numerous successful heat shock transformations using only 8.4 ng of DNA and 5.9 ?L of competent cells.This waslikely due to the primitive and direct way cells were fed into and out of the chip (usinga syringe to push in/out cells and eye-measuring to see whether cells have entered thechip makes for inaccurate timing and a lot of back and forth).For each transformation at a set temperature the amount of formed colonies can be viewed in figure 3.The average (avg) number of colonies at each temperature drops slightly when going from 55 ?C, 65 ?C to 75 ?C since the latter two contain replicates with zero number of colonies.The avg value for the number of colonies at each temperature was used to determine the average transformation efficiency, represented by the cfu/\u00b5g value and is presented in Table 3.We found that the transformation efficiency was much higher in the conventional heat shock than on our chip.There was also very high variation in the transformation efficiency among the experiments done on on the chip(which were done using similar/identical reagents).Figure 3 shows the data points for the triplicates at each temperature having a large spread of the amount of formed colonies.That is, two transformations carried out on the chip in the same manner could yield a varying number of colonies.The cleanliness of our chip was good as little to no colonies grew on the plates with only SOB run through the chip nor on the plates with only cells (negative control).The plates with bacteria transformed on the chip showed many colonies, considering the small amount of cells and DNA that were plated.On a per plate basis the highest efficiency we had was123 000 and the lowest was 0 (8 out of 50 plates had 0 colonies), with the averageseveral potential causes which could cause this large variation of results.Variation could be due to human error.Here the raw data of every transformation is presented alongside the comparison transformations we did.According to the results presented in Table 1 and Table 2 the heat shock chipdid not reach higher efficiency than conventional methods, at least with the comparison metrics used.The crosses represent each replicate, the circle is a contamination check, and the rhombs are the average amount of colonies at each temperature.The highest average value for formed colonies was at 55 ?C for the heating fluid, giving 30 colonies whilst heat shocking at 65 ?C and 75 ?C yielded 21 and 14.7 colonies.In other words, the transformation worked on our chip and it greatly reduced the amount of reagents needed since colony growth was observed on plates were only 6mL of cell/DNA suspension was heat shocked.The setupof the chip involved running heated water from a beaker through the chip and thismeans that there can be a chance that there is higher or lower thermal leakage thanexpected, leading to the transformation efficiency being affected.55 ?C showed formed colonies for each of the three replicates.Figure 3.Mean transformation efficiencies of the different chips (1-3) and conventional transformations (0).Number of colonies formed after transformation at each temperature.Calculations of colony forming units per microliter DNA were made and the mean for each chip is shown in Figure 1.", "safety": "Besides following standard laboratory safety procedures (gloves, glasses, laboratory coat) we also did the majority of our work in a fume hood or in a \u0093clean corner\u0094.Still we maintained good lab etiquette and treated it with similar safety precaution as we did with E. coli.Acrylamide - The gel used for SDS-PAGE is made from an acrylamide solution.Cured PDMS is also non-toxic and does not have any specific flammability.Chloroform - Chloroform was used for cleaning PDMS, glass/plexiglass slides and the chip molds, especially directly after receiving the molds or directly after a curing of a new chip.To keep bottles of growth media sterile, we used gas burners on the bench.Since chloroform can melt vinyl gloves to the skin we used nitrile gloves when handling it.Whenever liquid nitrogen was used, we made sure to use safety goggles, insulating gloves and worked in a well ventilated area.Nickel Sepharose Fast Flow - Resin used for IMAC loaded with Ni2+ ions is flammable.During work with liquid PDMS we always worked in a fume hood, except when we put the mold inside the laboratory oven.Furthermore we always left all chemicals related to the creating and curing of the chips inside the fume hood, to prevent any gas leaks to the rest of the laboratory.CRISPR systems as Cas9 and CPF1 have the ability to digest DNA, making them a possible mutagen.As a final safety precaution we blasted our guide RNAs against the human genome before we synthesised them, choosing only sequences that had low or no homology.The gas burners were also used to sterilize loops for streaking bacteria and to sterilize glassware at the bench.We used the E. coli strains DH5?, MG1655, BL21(DE3).Even if non-pathogenic organisms are used, some of the reagents can be harmful for humans and the environment.Chief among these were ethanol and 2-propanol, but we also used chloroform during some parts of the summer.Since liquid nitrogen expands a lot when it boils, a special thermos has to be used to ensure that gaseous nitrogen can escape.Before starting the work in the lab, the whole team attended a safety demonstration regarding the lab and lab work.Gloves should always be worn when working with SYBR safe.Liquid nitrogen - We used liquid nitrogen to snap freeze our freshly made competent cells before placing them in a -70? freezer.It should always be handled in a fume hood using nitrile gloves.SYBR Safe - This compound is used to stain the DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis.It is however very unlikely to affect humans (or any eukaryote) as the protein would have to get into the nucleus.The booklet \u0093Common sense for laboratory work\u0094 by IBG, Uppsala University was available in the lab for quick referencing.However protective glasses, gloves and lab coat should always be worn since PDMS is very sticky and can easily stick to clothes or skin, where it is hard to remove and poses a moderate eye hazard.If CPF1 would end up in the cytoplasma, it would then have to be transported into the nuclei for it to be able to cut in the genome.That way, even if CPF1 was imported into our cells and then into the nucleus, it would have no nuclease activity.When possible we forwent the use of chloroform in favor of using 2-propanol or ethanol.During work with microfluidics we used some chemicals for cleaning PDMS, mold, plexiglass and glass slides prior to usage.A lab technician was available during the weeks for further support and questions.The protein would have to be transported over the cell membrane.Working in a lab involves many safety concerns.When handling the organisms, we wore lab coats and gloves when needed.While it is much less toxic and a less potent mutagen than Ethylium bromide, it is by no means completely safe to work with.Since not all team members had previously worked with bacteria or other microorganisms, the more experienced team members taught the others proper sterile technique and how to handle biological samples.", "keywords": "TAT-Apoptin antibiotics mechanical encryption calcitonin LC-Cutinase fusicoccin tetracycline controlled polystyrene", "track": "Hardware", "part_favorite": "",

corrected by putting a \"*\" at the end of an amino acid sequence.First sequence contains at least 50nt of the 3  end of the backbone where the 5  end of the first fragment will join toLast sequence contains the 5  end of the backbone where the the 3  end of the last fragment will join to This is illustrated in the following figure, where the first sequence in the file is \"Backbone front\", last sequence is \"Backbone rear\", and the middle sequences in the file would be the N fragments listed in order of assembly.Sample input and output files are also included in the repository and are listed below:Once the user input files have been formatted properly, the script can be run.Before the script can be run, make sure you have downloaded the following files to a directory of your choosing:These files contain the functions needed by the main script to run the algorithms, and also contain libraries for the program to read from that contain codon and nucleotide pairing maps, and restriction site sequences.which are codon frequency use tables for their respective organisms.This should open a command line interface in which the program can be run.Commands are input into the program in the following format:python seq_analyzer.py -if sequence_file -m (g)ibson/(p)rotoptimization -c organism_codon_file -o output_file -t speed-if = input filename, note the input file should be in the same directory-m = mode, p for protein optimization, and g for gibson primer design-t = speed at which you want to run the program\u0096a larger number is 0.The required arguments are -if, -m, and -c. If no output filename is designated, the output file will be named after the input file with \u0093.output\u0094 concatenated on the end.if no speed is designated, the default speed is 1 second between each step.python seq_analyzer.py -if sequence_file -m g -c ecoli -o output -t 10python seq_analyzer.py -if sequence_file -m g -c ecoli 10Both commands above do the same thing, except the first command designates an output file called output and makes the operation run at 10 seconds between each step.The script will then run and depending on the operation selected ask for appropriate user input and at the end output a text file with the results.When running the protein optimization module, the program will process each sequence individually.The sequences should also contain no other characters other than that representing nucleotides (A,T,G,C) or amino acids (G,A,L,M,F,W,K,Q,E,S,P,V,I,C,Y,H,R,N,D,T,*).For protein optimization, sequences in the input file are not limited to only amino acid or nucleotide sequences--the user can input either and the program will recognize the sequence type and process it accordingly.This newly optimized area will then replace the original code.When running the gibson optimization module, the program will ask the user for a melting temperature and a salt concentration.No further formatting is needed for the github link download.In order to run the program, the user has to provide a text file containing the sequences in need of optimization and/or primer design.These will then be output in a text file in a readable format.Sample output files are included for Protein Optimizationand Gibson processeson github, and linked in iGEM under \"Input File Formatting\".If there are any questions and/or comments concerning the program and its usage, please let us know!For each sequence, the program will convert the sequence to its codon optimized DNA form (for amino acid sequences, it will convert it directly to an optimized DNA sequence; for DNA sequences, it will convert it into an amino acid sequence to verify length, and then conver it to an optimized DNA sequence).Each sequence will then be scanned for restriction sites\u0096if a restriction site is found, the program will isolate that area, and iterate over optimal codons until it finds an iteration that does not contain any restriction sites.Note because IGEM does not support .py file extensions, you will need to remove .txt from the extensions of all of the downloaded files from the links below and append \".py\" to the end of (1) seq_analyzer, (2) seq_tools, (3) input_tools, and (4) format_tools (i.e.If a different codon table is desired, the user can create a textfile with each row (codon) arranged as such:3nt_codon, \t, single_letter_aminoacid_abbreviation, \t, frequency, #/1000To run the script, you will need to open terminal or command prompt on your computer.This is limited however in cases where the only amino acids in the sequence are alanine, threonine, cysteine, and glycine, since the single letter code for each amino acid is also found in the single letter nucleotide representations.For windows, press Windows+R, and then type \u0093cmd\u0094 into the run bar, and hit enter.", "human_practice": "However, in the case of materials manufacturing, for which environmental sustainability would be an intended selling point, this level of water consumption might not be justifiable.Finally, we met with Michael Lepech, Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, who has expertise in life cycle analysis (LCA) and has conducted research with NASA on the use of biomaterials for construction.NASA\u0092s Office of Planetary Protectionhas established a set of guidelines by which to evaluate appropriate precautions for planetary research.1 These guidelines are designed to protect \u0093solar system bodies [\u0085] from contamination by Earth life, and [to protect] Earth from possible life forms that may be returned from other solar system bodies.\u0094 The policies most relevant to our summer research include \u0093NPR 8020.12D: Planetary Protection Provisions for Robotic Extraterrestrial Missions\u0094 and \u0093NPG 8020.7G: Biological Control for Outbound and Inbound Planetary Spacecraft.\u0094 Since our bioballoon would ideally be used for research on planets with the potential to support Earth life, it would need to comply with the Mission Category IVb and IVc regulations designed for landing/probe missions investigating extant life on Mars.However, we have intentionally designed our bioballoon so that it might be compatible with future protocols.Earth Applications: The Problem of Environmental Sustainability Figure 2: The Stanford Space Initiative s latex balloon after a successful launch We found ourselves asking, \u0093What would be the real benefit of being able to produce latex in bacteria for Earth applications?They encouraged us to set goals based on maximum lab yields and standard industrial operations costs and adjust from there.Taking Dr. Konda and Dr. Neupane\u0092s advice, we decided to develop a vision of our end goal: if we were going to compete with natural latex, priced at less than $1 per gallon, then we would surely need to operate on a massive industrial scale.These researchers included Dr. James Head, Louis and Elizabeth Scherck Distinguished Professor of Geological Sciences at Brown University, investigator on several NASA and Russian Space missions, and current co-investigator for the NASA MESSENGER mission to Mercury and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter; Dr. Lynn J. Rothschild, our team PI, evolutionary biologist and astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center, Adjunct Professor at Brown University (Molecular and Cellular Biology and Biochemistry) and at UC Santa Cruz (Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology); Dr. Jill Tarter, Bernard M. Oliver Chair for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Research at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California; and Dr. Alan Stern, former chief of all space and Earth science programs (2007-2008), current leader of NASA\u0092s New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, and current Chief Scientist at World View Enterprises, a company developing high-altitude balloons for commercial use in research and private space exploration.We tend to assume that we\u0092re working on an environmentally friendly technology, but would our method really be more environmentally friendly than growing latex in Southeast Asia?\u0094 We started reaching out to people who might be able to help us answer these questions.First, we met with Dr. Anne Schauer-Gimenez of Mango Materials, whose company produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable plastic, by a novel method.Professor Lepech, whom we met through Stanford connections, had surprisingly led us back to NASA.Our team ultimately integrated our research into the design of our project by reinvesting in the idea of developing space materials that might be repurposed in years to come.I (Amy) asked him if he could help me predict, based on gross assumptions about the scale-up process, what we would need to run an industrial-scale latex bio-manufacturing facility and what price we might expect to set for our latex.(A side note: We also met with Dr. Stephen Comello, Associate Director of the Sustainable Energy Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, who encouraged us to reach out to major rubber manufacturing companies and ask them how our technology might impact their operations and marketing strategies.These materials would need to be thoroughly purified and separated from live cells before balloon construction.We would need to come up with atmospheric sensing and UV protection mechanisms that could operate in vitro and attach to a balloon membrane.The problem of how one might operate a Mars onsite synthetic biology lab and sterilize the resulting materials remains an area for future research.We have organized the \u0093human practices\u0094 elements of our research this summer into two categories, which follow from the two spaces in which our technology might be applied: outer space and Earth.)Figure 1: Members of the Stanford-Brown Team with Dr. Alan Stern These researchers conveyed to us the inestimable value of origin of life research on other planets.And in our meetings with the Stanford Space Initiative and with Dr. Alan Stern of World View, we attempted to better understand existing needs in space exploration that might be met by biomaterials.Without going through this process ourselves, it would be difficult to realistically project price, yield, and environmental impact of our latex manufacturing method.Only about 13% of US electricity comes from renewable energy sources.4 Second, the production and distribution channels for traditional manufacturing materials have become so efficient that it is nearly impossible for biomaterials to compete on price alone.This meeting also reinforced the message to our team that we will not be able to influence manufacturing practices unless we can sustainably sell latex at or below prevailing market prices.We next met with Murthy Konda and Binod Neupane of the Joint Bioenergy Institute (JBEI) Techno-economic Analysis Team to get advice about how to predict and assess the feasibility and sustainability of our latex production.We then determined our project categories:We would need to produce materials in bacteria that could be used for a balloon membrane.Though our materials could be produced in living organisms, the final balloon mechanisms would need to work in vitro.After reviewing these documents, we quickly realized that if we wanted to develop a practical tool for interplanetary life research, that tool would need to be completely devoid of life.Genentech uses a huge amount of water: judging by their 2015 corporate sustainability letter, their water usage is equivalent to that for roughly 10% of households in San Francisco County.23 Of course, Genentech has a massive facility that produces large amounts of pharmaceuticals, and based on my conversation with Mr. Davis, the same processes that ensure the purity (and safety) of pharmaceuticals seem to be some of the most water-intensive.The Mango Materials PHB will need to be price competitive with polyactic acid (PLA) and polypropylene in order to achieve goal impact, Dr. Schauer-Gimenez explained, because 80% of consumers care only about cost efficiency.In theory, the Mango Materials plastic should create a closed-loop cycle: methane fuels plastic production, the plastic releases methane upon degeneration, and the same net methane is used to produce more plastic.Dr. Schauer-Gimenez laughed: \u0093Even our Berkeley friends who are environmentally conscious won\u0092t pay $3 a pound for plastic!\u0094 By the time our meeting was over, I had realized that investment in scale-up was not trivial.However, any potential benefit to this technology would be quickly negated if those tools were to contaminate the planet with Earth life.Developers of biotechnology for space research therefore need to go to great lengths to mitigate the risk of interplanetary contamination.Biological research tools (like our balloon) that could be developed onsite and thus eliminate transportation costs would, in theory, propel research forward.We spoke to several planetary scientists about the profound significance of responsible research on planets like Mars and Venus and on moons like Titan and Europa.In response, Professor Lepech pointed at my shirt: \u0093Only about a dime was probably spent on transport for that.\u0094) Because bio-manufacturing is so expensive and yields are so low, the market currently incentivizes bio-manufacturing of small, expensive products.They explained their strategy: the techno-economic analysis team sets a price point (or carbon emission) goal for an overall process, and then they develop a computational model to establish the thresholds that individual project teams must meet to achieve that goal.This research helps us better understand and appreciate our position in the universe.(Listen to the podcasts of our interviews with Dr. Rothschild, Professor Head and Dr. Tarter here.Pharmaceuticals are the perfect fit, as are expensive, complicated materials (like Bolt Threads\u0092 spider silk5).First, he emphasized that the environmental impact of a process is inextricably linked its energy source.Once developed for space, Professor Lepech suggested, these materials might make their way back to Earth.Any bio-manufacturing facility in the US is mostly running on fossil fuels.Even at this massive scale, it is unclear that our latex production would be environmentally friendly as compared to traditional farming.It could be, then, that space exploration will provide the necessary incentives to develop biomaterials, incentives that our Earth market economy lacks.It forces us to reconsider our definitions of life (if we found \u0093life\u0094 on another planet, would we recognize it?)and confront the precariousness of human existence (what were the conditions that allowed life to appear and evolve on Earth?).Like other biomaterials companies, Mango Materials depends on bacteria to produce their plastic; however, their bacterial ecosystem runs on methane gas.We contacted Michelin Tires to ask them about their new sustainable natural rubber policy.6 We saw this policy as indication that tire companies might be looking for more sustainable sources of rubber, since natural rubber plantations currently contribute to deforestation and are susceptible to blight.7 However, we have yet to hear back from Michelin.", "modeling": "Elementary flux mode analysis allows us to calculate the elementary flux modes, which are analogous to the  metabolic freedom  of the metabolic model.In a standard, unmodified metabolic network, the amount of pABA being produced is relatively little.By changing the glucose uptake mechanism, we expect to see an increase in the amount of pABA.With R34 removed, the results were:From these results, we can identify R34 as a possible target for gene knockout.Using the EFMs, we are able to understand all of the \"potential capabilities\" of the organism.We also used several MATLAB scripts from Dr. Nils Averesch to calculate product yields from the EFM model.The calculated product yield was: The biomass vs. product yield graph is shown below:We generated a metabolic network where R34 (Phosphotransferase system

strains T7 Express, T7 lysY/Iq, NEB 5-alpha, VH33.Did we experiment with any other organisms?We will experiment with the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, utilising a natural endogenous pathway (requiring sulfur deprivation and absence of light) to produce both oxygen and hydrogen gas.How does our project work?Our entire project is to do proof-of-concept work for a biologically produced balloon that can explore planetary atmospheres.We reduce the risk of allowing our E. coli to grow and reproduce outside of our experiments by wearing gloves, sterilising our biowaste before throwing it away, and spraying down surfaces with ethanol.How do we envision our project being used in the real world?We envision our project as a biologically-created weather balloon for exploration on Earth, Venus, Mars, Titan, or other planetary bodies.What risks might our project pose in the \"real world\"?coli is a relatively safe organism to work with, but we are still engineering genes into our E. coli that confer a number of dangerous properties, such as antibiotic resistance and the ability to create and secrete proteins that are not innate to E. coli.They are produced in E. coli, purified, concentrated, and then bound to cellulose sheets to create a temperature-sensitive colour gradient for sensing nearby temperatures during flight.How did we limit risk-taking actions during our project?E.Other risks that our project may pose is that the balloon may introduce (biodegradable but still foreign) waste onto non-Earth planets, and we can work in the future to increase the degradability of our project as well as develop safe recovery mechanisms for our balloon in space.Additionally, E. coli will be made to produce melanin that can be linked to our various membrane types using a binding domain by taking advantage of E. coli s tyrosinase pathway.Our human practices project focuses around the work that might need to be done in the future for responsibly introducing this production method into the greater community.An additional project is using the natural gas production cycle of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to produce hydrogen and oxygen gas for flight in various atmospheres.E. coli transfected with appropriate DNA will be made to produce these materials endogenously, then lysed so that the protein/polymers can be extracted and assembled into sheetlike

and Delphine.The European Experience was co-organized with IONIS iGEM team, and Taman, Maria, Alba, Jordan and Yanis were in charge of interteam communication.Flux Balance Analysis was performed by Amir, with the help of Toky and Maria.To initiate the team, we had the advice of Tristan Cerisy (PhD student, CEA).Further developments were done by all members of the team.During the development of the project, there were several people external to the team who gave advice or helped as indicated:During the brainstorming, other students were part of the team.Other members helped contacting them, as well as creating the crowdfunding campaign.The acquisition of lab material was coordinated by Mounia, Charlotte and C\u00e9cile.Treasury and funding administration was hold by Vincent and Toky, supervised by C\u00e9cile.Team task management was coordinated by Maria, with the advice of Alba and C\u00e9cile.The logo, Wiki and documents were designed by Jean.Human Practices were developed by Taman with the help of the team.The Evry iGEM Team 2016 was created by students enrolled in the M2 Systems and Synthetic Biology (mSSB), during the very first months of lessons.In late March, and after several project discussions, the \"Let s PLAy\" idea was presented to researchers on the Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (iSSB) in Evry, and was finally chosen.For modeling the Dynamic regulation with Kappa, we had the collaboration of Adrien Blasso-Blandin (Postdoc, ENS Lyon - HMS).All the iSSB researchers were prone to help: PhD students, research internals, employees and professors.iSSB: All the experiment performance was possible thanks to the space given in iSSB and Absynth lab, managed by Fran\u00e7ois K\u00e9p\u00e8s (iSSB director) and Joan H\u00e9risson.In the

university campus, directed by Patrick Curmi, and its related associations coordinated by Sylvain Fisson.Toky and Jonathan participated on the design.Finally, we would like to thank our team supervisors, Andrew Tolonen and Bruno Colombo; our cheering committee, leaded by comandante Shawez; the Ulule contributors; our classmates and our families, for all the support they provided during these months.For engagement, we were facilitated to do presentations to high school students by Laurent Martorell and C\u00e9line Barreto, teachers of Langevin-Wallon high school.For human practices, we had several helpers, referred in the Integrated Practices page.Zaahith Abdoulatif (L3 Life Sciences) defended our project in front of the subvention CROUS commission.None of the research lines of iSSB were dedicated to polymer bioproduction.For the MOOC, we went to record at the Maison des Initiatives \u00e9tudiantes.By getting motivation and advices from ex-iGEMers, the team quickly started doing weekly Journal Clubs - to speak about science and share synthetic biology knowledge.The survey was conceived by Taman, along with Yanis Khenniche (L3 Life Sciences) and Vincent, data were processed by Jean.From that point on, we kept designing the project and the real wet-lab work started at the beginning of July.Cloning experiments for E. coli were performed by Charlotte, Delphine, Jonathan, Mounia, supervised by C\u00e9cile.On January, the Brainstorming session started, organized solely by the students.Experiments for collaboration with Paris-Bettencourt were performed by Robert while being supervised by C\u00e9cile.Video edition was performed by Jean, and content was also defined by Robert and Maria.For filling the wiki, we received advice from Fran\u00e7ois Bucchini (Research assistant, iSSB).G\u00e9nopole: The major part of financial support came from G\u00e9nopole biocluster, with the approval of Emmanuel Dequier.Along the project design, Mauro Moreno (M2

involves important safety issues that we considered in the design of our project.The Polylactic acid (PLA) produced by Pseudomonas putida that we want to manufacture is designed to be use in everybody s daily life, and also in different application such as drug delivery, so it is key that we detail its biosafety to reassure this usability.We used coding for Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase, this part is necessary for the polymerization of the lactyl-CoA into PLA.The PLA can be reused if it undergoes a special treatment, different from the one performed for common plastics.In order to reduce these two main risks, a sensitivization campaign on the correct way to throw away PLA waste should be prepared and spread with the items produced with our PLA and during events involving public audience.This enzyme catalyzes the polymerization of the lactyl-CoA into PLA and it has no virulence factor, which makes it safe.If released in the environment, our engineered bacteria won t be able to produce PLA due to the fact that the PLA producing operon is under control of an IPTG inducible promoter.Choosing Pseudomonas putida as chassis has multiple advantages; not only for its ability to produce lactate and making good polymerization but also because it is a versatile saprophytic soil bacterium that has been certified as a biosafety host for the cloning of foreign genes.Pseudomonas putida KT2440 belongs to the risk group 1 of the non-pathogenic organisms.Thus, it would be important to avoid the accumulation of PLA waste in the environment.Another main risk would be the \"contamination\" of the recycling trashes with PLA waste.Moreover, our strain, KT2440, is the first Gram-negative soil bacterium to be certified as a safe strain by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and is the preferred host for cloning and gene expression in Gram-negative soil bacteria.Indeed, in France, recycling waste has a great importance but people are often not enough aware of the different type of waste and could easily throw away the PLA articles with the other plastics.Other risks linked to our project context, would be the dissemination of the PLA product waste into the environment.This part catalyzes the transformation of lactate into lactyl-CoA (necessary for the synthesis of PLA).Pseudomonas sp.MBEL 6-19 NA (the risk group is not indicated in [3]).We used the gene coding for the Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase.", "design": "In order to do so, we took a series of steps that helped us decompose and achieve the task: Optimization through DIY bioprocess design (Improvements) Analysing each of the steps individually allowed us to go into further detail on the theoretical conception of our project.In our project, we aimed to apply these design principles to solve our PLA bioproduction problem.", "human_practice": "During this year s edition of iGEM, the team \u00c9vry has had the opportunity to co-organize a big European meet-up, with iGEM IONIS, and to attend to a regional Ile-de-France meet-up celebrated in Paris, organized by iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Paris Saclay.On the 2nd and 3rd of July, our iGEM team coorganized the European Experience with iGEM IONIS team.This fantastic meeting was performed at the Pasteur Institute and organized by iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Paris Saclay.Demonstration of a Drone was performed and garden picnic allowed to tighten the link between iGEMers in the Parisian area.All the teams were able to present their projecs, as well as share ideas and explore new possibilities for collaborations.", "modeling": "We have performed an extended pathway analysis and we have studiedpossible feedback regulation systems, bringing a new approach on genetic circuitry to iGEM community.The extension of pathway analysis consisted on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA).We have conceived a feedback system depending on a lactate biosensor and inhibition of promoters, as explained in Dynamic Regulation.We have modified a published SBML model of P. putida KT2440 to include our PLA production reactions and, by using OptFlux software, we have performed the analysis shown in Flux Balance Analysis.By studying these fluxes, we can predict the effect of genetic modifications - genes knock out or overexpressions - or the variations that initial carbon source can bring and optimize the system.In order to model it, we have

protein.2) Create an oxytocin quality sensor using a G-protein coupled receptor in yeast: The second goal of our project was to design and test a diagnostic system for medication quality that leveraged G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in yeast.1) Design and build low-cost open source biotools: Denver, allowed our team to build many of the tools we use in the lab including a fluorimeter, an optical density sensor, a DNA concentration meter, an incubator, a refrigerated centrifuge, and a yeast dryer, which we will be exhibiting at the Jamboree expo as part of our \"Hardware\" track deliverables.We are working to improve upon their part by experimenting with different secretion tags to facilitate easier We are still working on this aspect of the project, researching possible mechanisms for producing the human oxytocin protein using yeast, and exploring possible temperature regulation mechanisms to mitigate the instability of this essential medication.In our work on this aspect of the project we experimented with different reporters, yeast promoters and terminators, yeast strains, and selection techniques.Our goal was to use the same GPCR approach to design yeast that could detect active oxytocin in order to determine if the medication sample was expired or not.The goal of the Lethbridge team was also to create a longer-lasting form of oxytocin by adding precursor molecules to slow the hormone s degradation.We therefore wanted to design a system where engineered yeast could be \"dried\" similar to the process for bakers and brewers yeast, shipped in inexpensive packets at room temperature, and reconstituted on site to preform the intended diagnostic funtion.We also used a four-button Olimex LCD screen, which required re-mapping functions to the four different buttons, and adding DNA concentration calculations to the code base.The fluorimeter and optical density sensor we built was based on a design by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team.We used 3A assembly to remove the composite part which included a yeast promoter, a RBS, our OXTR part, a terminator, and the FUS-1 and EGFP parts from TU-Delft.We relied on the DIY receptor design instructions created by oxytocin GPCR.We also requested a part iGEM HQ submitted by the Lethbridge Canada 2013 iGEM team .Different colored filters can be inserted interchangeably into the cuvette holder to filter different frequencies of light, and thus detect opitcal density or fluoresence or DNA concentration.We have begun work on this aspect of the project in several ways.We began by designing our receptor using SnapGene (one of our generous sponsors) and having it synthesized by IDT (for free as part of their sponsorship of iGEM 2016, thank you!)", "design": "Place a piece of sturdy tape across 1/3 of the vent opening (see image below) - this will create a vortex when the air and yeast leave the column, facilitating the precipitation of the dried yeast into the bottle10\" slit in the column/vortex cylinder with vacuum attachment 1.Take the 4\"-to-6\" reducer and attach it to the 4\" 90-degree elbow coming from the top of the powder separation column 4.Attach the 14\"-to-8\" reducer to one end of the 20\" column 4.Attach the 4\"-to-3\" reducer to the end of one 12\" piece  3.Using high temperature foil tape, attach a 3\" 90-degree duct elbow to the openings of the copper pipes (this is where the blow dryer will attach)Copper elbows pointing into the column/vortex cylinderAssembled airbrush and copper elbows on the top/outside of the column/vortex cylinder 1.Attach the 4\" 90-degree elbow to the 4\" end of the last reducer  6.Attach a 4\" 90-degree elbow to the other 12\" piece (this will connect to the exhaust manifold) 5.Tape the 3\" plastic funnel to the end of the 4\"-to-3\" connector 4.Use epoxy to secure the cap to the funnel (so dried yeast can be funneled into clean bottles which can be switched out)Connected powder seperation column and exhaust manifoldWhile you have the epoxy out...set up your liquid media bottle!Fill the media bottle with liquid yeast culture, turn on the air compressor (hooked up to the airgun on the top of the column/vortex).We also noticed during our test runs that the vacuum bag on the exhaust manifold collected quite a bit of yeast, so a second powder separation column should be added to future designs of this dryer.(Optional) We used a piece of Ecovative Myco Foam we grew to create padding that sits on thePreparing to cut the myco foam to fit the diameter of the columnUsing a drywall saw to cut the myco foam for the stand supportColumn sitting in dryer stand with myco foam support To operate our fully assembled yeast dryer, you will need a ladder, two blow dryers, a power strip, liquid yeast culture, and an air compressor to provide the pressure for the airgun.The dried yeast falls to the bottom of the column and is collected, while the excess air is vented out.And finally, we would explore different coatings for the inside of the column that could help prevent the yeast from getting stuck to the insides of the column.The 0.7mm nozzle sprayed too much liquid, and contributed to a lot of the yeast sticking to the sides of the column.To avoid this in future iterations, we would explore using higher velocity and hotter air in the heating manifold and the column.Cut two three-inch slits 10 inches apart in the middle of the 20\" cylinder (see image below) 2.Cut a small hole in the bottom of the liquid media bottle and epoxy a piece of tubing with the airgun attachment on the other end into the hole (let dry).Attach the vacuum hose attachment into the 10-inch slit with tape  3.We also insultated the column with space-blanket-like material to reduce the dried yeast powder from sticking to the We found that vast majority of the yeast powder was sticking to the inside of the column.Assemble the large square base using 8 of the 1-foot sections, 4 of the elbows, 3.We would also insert acrylic windows into the column so we could watch the activity inside the column during test runs.We found that the \"warm\" setting on high for the blow-dryer blowing into the vacuum attachment and high, hot setting on the heating manifold blow-dryer worked the best.Attach the 8\"-to-6\" reducer to the 14\"-to-8\" reducer and the 6\"-to-4\" reducer to the 8\"-to-6\" reducer.Place 45-degree street and regular fittings in the holes all pointing toward the airbrush tip inside the duct cap - use high temperature foil tape to the secure the fittings in place 4.Attach the bottle to the airgun and start spraying!Cut a hole into the cap of the 1-liter media bottle  6.Pictured below is a general design Liquid culture is piped through an atomizer at the top of the column.Hot air is simultaneously vented into the column, and a third inlet to column vents air to create a vortex inside.Note: We also tried to avoid static electricity buildup by grounding our column to the building.Attach the top square to the tops of the 4-foot pieces of PVC.", "human_practice": "The final deliverable of our project, the yeast dryer, was designed to directly address sustinability issues by providing a low-cost and

purification, a lysis protocol was researched that would allow cell lysate to be used directly as the template for qPCR (Shatzkes et al 2014).Our team is the first to have developed a qPCR assay to measure the copy number of this backbone in the E. coli strain Top 10, a variant of the DH10B strain provided by Life Technologies.The plasmid pSB1C3 is a favored vector for iGEM projects, its high copy number making it a workhorse for gene expression.Using Tardigrades as a Developmental ModelAlthough organisms such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans are the conventional model organisms used to study development, the unique abilities of tardigrades compared to these two organisms enable us to potentially traverse uncharted terrain in the differential expression of genes upon

while lysate from cells with the plasmid was expected to have PCN+1 copies of the target sequence.In addition to measuring plasmid copy number, it was decided that steady-state mRNA count would also

not introduce DNA coding for either the Cas9 enzyme or the guide RNA into the cells of tardigrades.Instead, we chose to microinject ribonucleoprotein particles consisting of the Cas9 enzyme provided by New England BioLabs Inc. and complexed with guide RNA synthesized using the EnGen sgRNA Synthesis kit also from NEB.In our experiments we microinjected the tardigrades with a ribonucleoprotein particle (the Cas9 protein complexed with guide RNA) rather than a plasmid expressing Cas9 and a guide RNA.Special Considerations for the CRISPR / Cas9 systemA recurring theme in our public engagement experiences was that the use of CRSIPR to engineer organisms was a general concern, particularly when the CRSIPR system itself was perpetuated.This ensures that the system is transitory since both the protein and guide RNA will degrade, and also will not be passed on in the tardigrade progeny.We also were very careful to contain the tardigrades by treating them as we would bacterial cultures and discarding them in the biohazardous waste.Since we were altering the germline of an organism, one of our primary concerns when considering our experimental design using this system was the possibility of persistence of CRISPR DNA or even unintentionally introducing a gene drive.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Amplified LEA proteins AAvLEA1, RvLEAM, and HDLEA3 Transformed HDLEA1 ligationSuspended

ColiIntroduced to dehydration protocol, given by mentor Mike FlanaganIntroduced to serial dilution protocolVerified genes/sequences for synthesis and tardigrade-specific promoters (night meeting)Results: Conducted our very first desiccation experiment of E.coli.At the same time we were introduced to I0500 and the ribosome binding site protocol.", "protocol": "", "result": "Linear regression indicates approximately 13.4 copies of the target sequence for every cell in the reaction, or around 12-13 plasmid copies per cell.Note: The K909006-pSB1C3 harboring cells used for this run were lysed in mid-log phase, which may account for the reduced PCN.pSB1C3 absolute quantification run #3Lysate from 100,000 stationary phase cells harboring K909006-pSB1C3 was compared against a 3-point standard of 105, 106, and 107 copies.Linear regression indicates approximately 18.2 copies of the target sequence for every cell in the reaction, or around 17 plasmid copies per cell.pSB1C3 absolute quantification run #2Lysate from 100,000 mid-log phase cells harboring K909006-pSB1C3 was compared against a 3-point standard of 105, 106, and 107 copies.The comparative reference was K880005, also on pSB1C3 backbone (i.e., the plasmid under test minus the HDLEA1 coding sequence).The desiccation protocol was initially run to identify serial dilution values for each hour of desiccation that would result in a number of colony forming units per plate (CFU/plate) on the order of 30-300.Linear regression indicates approximately 30.9 copies of the target sequence for every cell in the reaction, or around 30 plasmid copies per cell.pSB1C3 absolute quantification run #4Lysate from 100,000 stationary phase cells harboring K909006-pSB1C3 was compared against a 2-point standard of 105 and 106 1.1x106 copies.Excellent agreement (within \u00b125%) with the observed average CFU/plate was found for both the reference and test plasmid systems after correcting for the dilution factor for H=0 hours of desiccation (i.e., no desiccation).For each hour (H=0, 4, 7.5 and 22.5) and each plasmid system under test (i.e., the K880005 reference and the HDLEA1-based K2128204), data were collected in triplicate and used to obtain an average and standard deviation for CFU/plate.Linear regression indicates approximately 25.5 copies of the target sequence for every cell in the reaction, or around 24-25 plasmid copies per cell.Three qPCR runs using stationary phase cells and one run using mid-log phase cells indicate a PCN of around 12-13 copies during log growth, increasing to around 24 copies per cell during stationary phase.Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for qPCR copy number analysis.Because qPCR consistently gave results significantly lower than the expected copy number, an alternate means of direct copy number analysis was attempted.1 billion cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100uL of CL Buffer.Finally, this protocol was used to evaluate a test LEA protein (HDLEA1).Part K2128204 (and the underlying Coding Sequence in part K2128004) was validated using a desiccation protocol that demonstrated the part worked as expected (i.e., improved survivability when the HDLEA1 coding sequence was expressed compared to when it was not expressed).This approximately three-fold improvement in survivability validates that the HDLEA1-related part (K2128204) works as expected.In contrast, the preliminary testing for the corresponding MAHS LEA protein (expressed using the part K2128200) does not show an improvement in desiccation survivability as shown in Table 3 and Figure 2.Table 3: MAHS-related (TEST_MAHS) data (raw, adjusted for dilution, and normalized)Data beyond H=7 hours of desiccation had failed positive controls that invalidated those results.10uL of lysate from E. coli was run on a 0.6% agarose gel with purified K909006-pSB1C3 at known concentrations for comparison of band brightness.Lanes were loaded in the following order (left to right)The band for the plasmid in E. coli lysate was much closer in brightness to the 10ng band than the 50ng one, indicating that close to 20 copies were harbored in each lysed cell.Due to time constraints, only a few qPCR runs could be completed prior to the Wiki freeze, so this data is still preliminary.Table 1: Reference (REF) data (raw, adjusted for dilution, and normalized)Table 2: HDLEA1-related (TEST_HDLEA1) data (raw, adjusted for dilution, and normalized)The combined graphical results for the normalized data are shown in Figure 1 below.As expected, the fraction of surviving cells decays monotonically with increasing desiccation time for both the reference (\u0093REF\u0094) and HDLEA1-based systems (\u0093TEST_HDLEA1\u0094).Desiccation Test Results for HDLEA1 (K2128204) and MAHS (K2128200)The desiccation protection part of our iGEM project involved determining how proteins in extremophile species such as tardigrades could assist bacteria to survive in desiccation circumstances.Beyond four hours, the plasmid expressing HDLEA1 shows an improved ability to survive desiccation in a manner that is statistically significant based on measured standard deviations.Things to consider would be:Microinjection technique and pressure used to injectWhether injections to the tardigrades\u0092 body parts other than the gonads prove lethalUnfortunately due to time we were not able to alter these different aspects of our protocol.A preliminary experiment was run using lysate from 1 million cells per reaction.While those control issues could not be resolved in time for iGEM deadlines, it was desired to supply this preliminary information as a guide to other teams that may wish consider use of this part.Based on this data, there is no evidence that the MAHS-related system (K2128200) provides any survivability benefit over the reference system (K880005).After excluding outliers caused by edge effects, average CT values for six replicates for each sample were compared:pSB1C3 absolute quantification run #1Lysate from 1 million stationary phase cells harboring K909006-pSB1C3 was run against a 3-point standard of 106, 107, and 108 copies.The dilution factor was corrected for in order to obtain the CFU in the desiccated 20uL aliquot and normalized by the measured CFU in a non-desiccated 20uL aliquot to obtain a survival rate versus time (i.e., fraction of surviving colonies).The K2128204 part consists of the Biobrick part K880005 (i.e., a strong constitutive promoter J23100 and strong ribosome binding site B0034) followed by the HDLEA1 coding sequence from K2128004.When placed on the high-copy-number plasmid backbone pSB1C3, maximal expression of HDLEA1 is expected.Due to the reduced amplification efficiency of the 108-copy standard in run 1, cell numbers were reduced 10-fold in all subsequent experiments.These parts were further assembled into functional genetic circuits to both support expression of the proteins of interest and also to identify reference controls against which we could compare performance.The OD600 of the initial overnight culture was taken (using a 1:10 dilution proxy) in order to obtain the expected number of CFUs in 20uL using the formula (0.02mL)*(8x108 CFU/mL/OD600)*OD600.Furthermore, the range of copy numbers detected for stationary phase cultures suggests that the copy number may take some time to stabilize after cell division halts.In particular, the amount improvement is estimated to be 3.2-fold (\u00b11.5) for H=7 hours of desiccation and 2.5-fold (\u00b11.3) for H=22.5 hours of desiccation.", "safety": "To eliminate this and minimize risk, we chose to design our experiment in such a way that we did not introduce DNA coding for either the Cas9 enzyme or the guide RNA into the cells of tardigrades.All samples were put in the biohazardous waste after use.Special Considerations for the CRISPR / Cas9 systemOur design incorporated additional controls used to minimise risk when using the CRISPR / Cas9 gene modification technique.For the second part of our project where we attempted to knocking out genes in tardigrades, we acquired a culture of the H. dujardini tardigrade strain from Carolina Biological Supply.Although tardigrades pose no risk to humans and are ubiquitous in the environment we still used standard lab practices for containment and treated all specimens as potential environmental contaminants.Since the parts and the chassis are from Group 1 organisms there were no unusual safety issues posed by this part of the project.We were particularly careful about discarding tardigrade samples since they live in freshwater and are hardy, and it was not clear to us if the species used was native to our geographic area.Since we were altering the germline of an organism, one of our primary concerns when considering our experimental design using this system was the possibility of persistence of CRISPR DNA or even unintentionally introducing a gene drive.The first part involved identifying unique tardigrade proteins that are likely part of the of tardigrades resistance to desiccation and then cloning them into E. coli to see if this resistance can be transferred to other organisms.Instead, we chose to microinject ribonucleoprotein particles consisting of the Cas9 enzyme provided by New England BioLabs Inc. and complexed with guide RNA synthesized using the EnGen sgRNA Synthesis kit also from NEB.", "keywords": "bioreactor regulatory connecting therapeutic relationship production tCas9-CIBN non-edible Countermeasures

vector.Part BBa_K608002 was then resuspended and transformed into NEB 5 alpha.8/4/15 - Transformation was successful and colonies were picked to generate overnight cultures containing the constitutive promoter.8/5/15 - All of the scar cloning materials finally came in the mail so we could begin trying to clone again.Gel extraction was run quickly and then transformed.8/7/15 - Still no colonies were observed from the previous transformation.It was hypothesized that our PIPE method had to be running into issues during the DpnI digestion/ligation step because we saw defined bands after PCR and high efficiency transformation so the insert must not be integrating.We then took that sample, along with CFA and GFP, and cleaned them in a PCR cleanup, quantified them and then ligated at a 1:2 molar ratio.8/26/15 - Once again no colonies were seen on any of the plates.To better understand the what was happening we sent the pVeg DNA along with the primers that we were using to see what was being amplified.7/15/15 - While waiting for the sequencing results we decided to move forward with the B. subtilis transformation.The same PIPE procedure was conducted using this new DNA.9/1/15 - Studied plates from PIPE transformation of both CFA and GFP downstream of the pLac promoter and saw isolated colonies.We focused on either trying to actively transport the protons out of the cell or quenching them in the cytosol using amino acid decarboxylases.7/1/15 - Based on these two systems we began planning out the experiments we would have to run to begin standardizing procedures to then use to test our acid resistance system while we continue to plan out exactly what that system is.Miniprep was conducted on the overnights generated from the PIPE colonies, but after digestion and visualization, it was clear that we had not inserted the CFA gene into the vector.So we ran the PCR at fewer cycles in order to see if those last 5 cycles were causing the cells to fix the sequence as if there was a final elongation step.9/14/15 - Observed plates from the three different transformations attempting to build CFA synthase gene downstream of the pLac promoter.This time we ran a background of only vector to account for the amount of perceived colonies that were just the result of re-ligation of the vector.9/5/15 - The plates from the transformation showed 2 colonies on both the background plate and on the recombinant plate, indicating that we did not get recombinants.The hypothesis appeared to be right because we saw much stronger bands from the this round of PCR.9/4/15 - DpnI digestion/ligation of the PIPE PCR products were conducted and then transformed into NEB 5 alpha cells.The pieces were then ligated together at a 1:2 molar ratio and transformed into NEB 5 alpha cells.8/6/15 - No colonies were observed on any of the plates indicating an unsuccessful transformation.Based on that sequence we then designed and ordered primers to use PIPE cloning to insert GFP into the pVeg vector.CFA and GFP insert digests were gel extracted and ligated downstream of the constitutive promoter using the same spectrum of vector to insert ratios used previously.All of the restriction enzymes, ligase, gel extraction, and genome extraction kits were ordered.7/24/15 - Starvation transformation was conducted again using the overnights and disposable flasks.7/25/15 - Still no colonies from the transformation.A gel was also run on the PCR products that were used for PIPE the day before.So we reran the DpnI digestion/ligation step of PIPE with the cleaned PCR products from before but with the previously used spectrum of vector to insert ratios.They were then transformed.8/31/15 - We reran the PCR on the pLac vector and this time saw much larger bands.We also weren\u0092t sure if the annealing temperature was too high for adequate binding so we ran the second PCR on a gradient.We opted to use the starvation method to induce the natural competence in B. subtilis and transform.7/6/15 - Resuspended both pVeg and GFP BioBricks and then transformed them into Top10 competent cells.7/7/15 - Colonies were observed on plates so the colonies were picked to make overnights.The conclusion was that the DNA was exposed to the UV for too long and so we decided to run another gel using the restriction digests from before.We also have been consistently getting weak bands from our vector PCRs so we are going to try running them temperatures, as opposed to the standard 72\u00b0C9/3/15 - PCRs were run passed on the troubleshooting from the day before.Even though the bands were the right size, we decided to change the restriction digest run time to see if that would help.We tried 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10 vector to insert then ligated and transformed.8/8/15 - No colonies were observed showing that the transformation was unsuccessful yet again.The DNA was then transformed.9/12/15 - Observed no colonies on the plates from the PIPE transformations.Colonies were picked for colony PCR using primers that lie outside of the prefix and suffix.The gel then revealed that we had a slight band in the right position.We picked the pAraC vector so that we could induce transcription with arabinose separately from inducing expression of CFA with IPTG.9/8/15 - Colonies were observed from the pAraC transformation.The gel showed large bands for CFA, SAM and the pLac vector but the pAraC vector still wouldn\u0092t amplify.The transformation was run with the pVeg plasmid as that will be the vector that the construct will be inside of.7/18/15 - Plates from the transformation yielded no colonies indicating a failed transformation.No colonies from the OEC transformation or from the PIPE products run at 35 cycles.Ran a colony PCR on the colony but the gel showed no amplicon indicating a failed PCR rather than a failed transformation.It was anticipated that maybe the procedure run time was much longer than it was supposed to be so we thought that maybe that was the issue because all of the OD readings matched the documented procedure\u0092s estimations.PCRs were run on the genome using these primers.Entertained diverse ideas from creating a pH sensing bacterium to use as a drug delivery system to fight cancer to using an enterobacterium that would function as a probiotic to try and suppress the Celiac\u0092s disease response to gluten.5/9/15 - Decided that focusing on in vivo projects isn\u0092t a good avenue for us to study because of the practical hurdles associated with trying to get an organism to live within the body and then to get that passed by the FDA.We were running low on mini prep reagents and so we only picked four colonies and so we picked more to see if maybe we just grabbed ones with religated vectors like those we saw on the background plate.We knew we didn\u0092t have time to order new primers, but scarless cloning procedures use similar primers so we kept with the ones that we had.Primers were designed and ordered.7/17/15 - The overnight cultures were used to run the starvation transformation protocol.Colonies were picked to generate overnights.8/14/15 - A genome extraction was preformed on the overnights.Primers were resuspended and used in PCRs with the GFP and pLac BioBricks along with the genomic DNA for CFA.The only other step that we though could possibly be causing issues was the gel extraction step.To remedy this issue we redesigned the primers to have a higher Tm and made sure that the Tm\u0092s of the primer pair were closer together to ensure that we are getting the proper binding of both at the same annealing temperature.The resulting DNA was transformed.8/21/15 - No colonies were observed on the plates.After that was run it was run on a gel and still yielded no bands.7/22/15 - We ran another B. subtilis starvation transformation using the, hopefully, detergent-free glassware and neutral deionized water.Our hope was to try and take several pivotal proteins from the complex and insert them into a high expression vector to see if by increasing the production of these proteins, we could increase the cellulolytic activity of the organism being used in the bioreactor.6/16/15 - Studied the actual workings of the fermentors at Anaerobe systems to see what problems were actually present.The only possibility that we could come up with was that we still were not successfully ridding the glassware of the detergents.We thought about trying to create an organism that would maybe aid in the production of T and B-cells.5/14/15 - Decided that we didn\u0092t have the proper resources to adequately test anything related to cancer research so we shifted gears.Digestion, ligation, and transformation were conducted on these segments into both NEB 5 alpha cells and T7 competent cells.9/16/15 - Gibson assembly transformations were successful from all three primer sets constructed for the integration of CFA downstream of the pLac promoter.1st round of PCR did not generate any bands on the agarose gel.A gel was run to verify that the OEC procedure was not successful.During this time we were also running a control acid shock assay to test the response of the untransformed T7 cells that we will be testing.9/13/15 - Began by rerunning the PCRs from the previous day and for some reason it worked this time.A plate was streaked out from the glycerol stock of the B. subtilis 168.7/16/15 - Colonies were picked from the streak plate of B. sub 168 to make overnights to seed the cultures for the transformation.These products were then transformed and plated.8/18/15 - Still no recombinants could be seen from the transformation.Thinking that we have changed all of the parameters that we could, we suspected that maybe there was an issue with the constitutive promoter sequence that was leading to neither of them working.The knew that the problem had to be embedded in the ligation step because we were getting clear amplification of the inserts and vectors and we have standardized our transformation protocol, so that leaves the ligation.Primers pairs were designed to amplify both the CFA and GFP inserts as well as to open up the pLac promoter.Overnights were still made from the colonies to be screened the next day.Based on all of the literature that we read on the PIPE method and primer design we couldn\u0092t find the issue.Materials were prepped again for the next day.7/20/15 - No colonies were once again observed on the plates.In order to address this issue we decided to create a two part project: one side will sense low pH which would then induce the expression of the other side which is the regulating system that would be responsible for returning the intracellular pH to neutral.6/26/15 - We met to discuss our findings related to the sensing and regulating systems utilized in nature.After burning so many days on the PIPE method we decided that it would be better to switch to the traditional scar cloning method.7/23/15 - Yet again the transformation didn\u0092t work.To fix this we decided to use disposable culture flasks that have never been exposed to detergents to ensure that is not the problem.We saw proper amplification of the GFP insert DNA but only saw a band that represented a substantially smaller segment than what was supposed to be there.Both PCRs of the inserts worked but the vectors were unsuccessful.9/10/15 - Transformation plates were checked but only one colony was observed.Primers also came in.7/21/15 - Overnights were created from the B. subtilis 168 plate.None of us were familiar with the cellulolytic pathways so we went and did more research.6/10/15 - Met up to discuss everyone\u0092s findings.Also miniprepped the overnight cultures made from the CFA and SAM genes inserted into the pSB1C3 vector to be sent into iGEM.DNA was sent to Sequetech for sequencing.9/15/15 - Observed colonies from the site-directed mutagenesis tranformation.We decided to use B. subtilis as our chassis because it shares close homology with Clostridia, which is the organism we aim to implement the system in.Another promoter, BBa_J04500, was resuspended and transformed along with BBa_R0040, BBa_B0015, and BBa_B0034.8/20/15 - DNA was extracted from the overnights and glycerol stocks were made.The gel revealed that CFA and SAM were successfully built into the vectors.We once again saw the proper amplification of the GFP insert but no amplification of pVeg.We hypothesized that it could have been the detergent residue left in the glassware that was causing the cells to not take up the DNA.The same spectrum of vector to insert ratios was used in the ligation.It was predicted that there was not a large enough concentration of mega-primer for the second PCR which would cause little binding to the template DNA.We found that the rate of activity of the organism was not the problem because they were using a cellulolytic Clostridium species, which has a doubling time of about 6 minutes.This indicated off target binding somewhere else in the vector.7/14/15 - Another round of PCR was run on both of the sequences to try and isolate the issue with the pVeg amplification.The 30 cycle PCR products yielded ~50 colonies on the concentrated plate with only 7 on the background plate.SAM was produced on the second and then nothing again in the third one of just CFA.We found that the exact mechanism for this degradation is still not well understood as it requires the use of a cellulosome, which is a conglomerate of numerous large proteins that has yet to be fully visualized.The product was then digested based on the standard assembly, as GFP was previously.We reran the digests based on the same protocol as before but this time used a spectrum of molar ratios.Only two bands were seen in the gel showing that the PstI site had been destroyed.To fix this issue we changed around our gel extraction protocol so that each lane was precut out of the gel so that only the band being cut would be exposed to the UV opposed to all of them being exposed.We chose to do it in the first place because of its close homology to Clostridia, but all we really need at the moment is to show some increase in acid resistance.It was found that the primer was preferentially binding to another site in the vector.DNA was then sent out for sequencing to verify the sequence posted on the Registry.7/10/15 - Sequences came back matching the anticipated sequences.We anticipate that the problem was with the molar ratio of vector to insert.There was no discrepancies between the sequences.Received the B. subtilis in the mail.We also ran a Gibson assembly utilizing the PCR products generated by the product of the 35 cycles of PCR generated through OEC.Primers were designed to flank the CFA synthase gene with overhangs that matched the sequence of the prefix and suffix.8/17/15 - Received primers in the mail.We saw this competition as a driving force to construct more parts to expand the registry rather than to create a stand alone project, so creating a pH sensing system could prove useful in other applications.5/16/15 - After more investigation we found that other pH sensors had been submitted to the Registry in the past but none were directly linked to transcription factors.We decided to revisit the primer design of the overhangs being used to see if that is where the problem lied.This could happen for a myriad of reasons but it is likely that the polymerase is going back and filling in the overhangs making it impossible to ligate.Ran three different PCRs replicating the PCRs that were conducted the day before but for some reason no amplicon was produced on the first round.We made an overnight from the colony to miniprep and analyze the next day.The cycles were maintained as well as the template DNA.The rest then went back to the pH sensing system.With the cloning process taking as long as it is, we moved to trying to extract our regulator gene CFA.To do this we had to figure out how to transform B. subtilis and what we were going to transform with.7/4/15 - Decided to use the pVeg promoter BioBrick as our test, constitutive promoter and then using GFP as our reporter gene.The hypothesis then turned to ligation time.8/10/15 - Restriction digests were preformed based on the prior specifications.The GFP plasmid was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and the constitutive promoter was digested with EcoRI and XbaI.We suspected that this was due to the annealing temperature being too high for proper binding.We hypothesized this to be the result of the high acid concentration in the culture that accumulated over the time of the culture.Some of us revisited the Celiac\u0092s disease idea and tried finding a site in the recognition of gluten in an attempt to find a spot to repress the response.Sequence data for the pSB1C3+CFA and pSB1C3+SAM came in and was analyzed in comparison to the anticipated sequence.One integrated a 6bp spacer between the RBS and ORF, while the other did not.We requested a streak plate of E. coli K-12 from the Steven\u0092s lab on the SCU campus to extract the DNA from.8/13/15 - Plate was received from the Steven\u0092s lab.~150 LB/LB+CAM plates were poured in preparation for the acid shock trials.An overnight culture was made from it into LB.7/11/15 - We successfully cultured up B. subtilis so we took a small aliquot to make a glycerol stock.7/13/15 - Primers arrived and PCRs were run.", "protocol": "At faster speeds the resolution of the bands of DNA

Coli.Cultures were induced at 60, 30, 15 minutes before, and at acid shock with 1mM IPTG.In Figure 2 there is an inverse correlation in the OD readings at stationary phase and the levels of acidity,

chaperonins isn\u0092t directly analogous with BMCs like EUTs, we can glean invaluable insights from Hoersch et alii\u0092s investigations: photoisomerizing noncanonical amino acids, when substituted into ideal loci of proteins, can allosterically manipulate tertiary and quaternary protein structures.To better characterize this targeting peptide, Choudhary et alii used 1-19AA-EutC to successfully target the bulky 464kDa homotetrameric \u00df-galactosidase to the interior of EutS and EutSMNLK protein shells: \u00df-galactosidase retained its functionality, hydrolyzing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- \u00df-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) into the insoluble, blue colored 5,5\u0092-dibromo-4,4\u0092-dichloro-indigo (2012).Background on Photoisomerizing Amino Acid Substitutions: Hoersch et alii\u0092s research on the incorporation of azobenzene into protein nanocompartments to impart light-inducible conformational modularity has granted utilitarian advantage to synthetic and molecular biologists alike.In light of future applications of photoswitchable molecular mechanization, Hoersch et alii note that protein complexes have been evolutionarily winnowed to exhibit deep energy wells in conformational landscapes that reflect thermodynamic ideals (in the case of chaperonins, energy wells exist for the open and closed states) (2013).These preliminary findings on the EUT BMC\u0092s structure and function indicate that it\u0092s among the simplest of the known proteinaceous BMCs, whereas the formation of propanediol-utilizing microcompartments (PDUs) and carboxysomes require orchestrated expression of larger genomic operons (2012).In light of Choudhary et alii\u0092s experimental observation that substitution of the conformationally labile glycine with valine at the 39th residue of EutS resulted in a mutant isoform ?V/G39V-EutS incapable of punctually sequestering coexpressed eGFP:1-19AA-EutC (ergo incapable of forming complete, functional BMCs), we conjecture that an amber stop codon substitution for an azobenene moiety containing amino acid at or near 39AA will serve as an ideal candidate for photoisomerization-driven molecular mechanization of EUTs.As Held et alii allude, the contemporary understanding of EUT BMCs\u0092 evolutionarily origins as selectively segregating nano-bioreactors lends to myriad synthetic applications of EUT functionality (Held, 2016).?C/K87C/S199C mutants of the chaperonin were azobenzene-crosslinked as such, and exhibited bidirectional light-inducible conformational change when examined on a native gel assay (2013).As previously indicated, Hoersch\u0092s research team used PyMol and Rosetta to find all cysteine residue pairs within 5-14\u00c5 in the closed conformation, and 16.6-19.5\u00c5 in the cytosolically-accessible state.EUT bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) house enzymes responsible for isolation and degradation of cytotoxic ethanolamine, and the genomic EUT operon genes are expressed only in the presence of ethanolamine and vitamin B12 (Choudhary et al., 2012).Thiol-reactive azobenzene-dimaleimide was introduced to selectively crosslink solvent-accessible cysteine residues on the translated group II chaperonins (Hoersch et al., 2013).The most prominent aspect of EUTs lending them to utilization as model protein nanocages is the capacity for a single gene\u0092s product (EutS) to homohexamerize and further oligomerize into polyhedral protein nanocages.To properly photo-mechanize protein structures with crosslinkers like azobenzene-dimaleimide, researchers should computationally verify that the conformational energy well(s) to overcome don\u0092t exceed the minute forces allosterically imbued by the photoisomerizing moieties.These results indicate that the quasi-polyhedral EutS shells may exhibit greater permeability of sequestered products or small molecule cargo than their five-component EutSMNLK counterparts (2012).Background on Computational Predictive Molecular Modelling: In an effort to avoid laborious high-throughput assays of potential azobenzene-containing EutS mutants, we\u0092ve opted to employ powerful modeling software to compute answers to the investigation\u0092s biochemical constraints.Ethanolamine-utilizing microcompartments (EUTs) are endogenous to Salmonella enterica, Clostridium difficile , and Escherichia coli (Held et al., 2016).To address these biochemical and thermodynamic constraints, we\u0092ve employed molecular modeling engines like PyMol and Rosetta to run predictions on the energetic feasibility of proposed amino acid substitutions.Fig.Further investigation of the conformational modularity of these chaperonins was carried out with cryo-electron microscopy; results corroborated the native gel findings (2013).Of the nine cysteine residue candidates for crosslinking in the chaperonin, three residue pairs were investigated, all of which appeared to impart some degree of photoswitchable conformational mechanization when crosslinked with azobenzene-dimaleimide (2013).EUT BMC functional schematic indicating the putative biochemical pathway for the catabolism of cytotoxic ethanolamine substrate into biologically-inert products including ethyl alcohol, acetyl-phosphate, and acetyl-CoA.As previously indicated, amino acids 1-19 of the EutC gene product appear to target covalently bound proteins to the interior of the forming bacterial microcompartment, as evidenced by the fluorescent puncta (points) observed in E. coli coexpressing EutS and EutC:eGFP, or EutSMNLK and EutC:eGFP.As Choudhary et alii illustrated, EutS and EutSMNLK shell proteins don\u0092t merely form hydrophobically agglomerated inclusion bodies; they\u0092re shown to form hydrophilic semi-regular polyhedrons of ~50nm and 100-150nm, respectively.\"Reprogramming an ATP-driven Protein Machine into a Light-gated Nanocage.\"In E. coli cultures coexpressing EutSMNLK and 1-19AA-EutC: \u00df-galactosidase in the presence of X-gal, accumulations of the vibrant indole indicator were observed within the BMCs, whereas otherwise equivalent cultures without EutS displayed cytosolically diffuse localization of the indigo indicator.In our fundamentally equivalent endeavors to photoisometrically mechanize the assembly and disassembly of EutS shell proteins, PyMol and Rosetta have been employed to incandesce potential candidate loci for noncanonical amino acid substitution(s).Figure courtesy Hoersch et alii\u0092s research team; cited from pp.\"Modularity of a

Ligation of the Neptune onto high and low cassettes and imaged these using electron microscopy.We extracted the Eut SMNLK via an agar stab provided from the Schmidt- Dannert lab and PCR amplified the Eut S gene using the biobrick primers and cloned on the high, low, and lac promoters onto the 1C3 backbone prior to the ligation of the Eut S gene onto these modified backbones.eGFP is good The Eut S lac: 4A5 construct has continued to show insert ligating to the 6A1 backbone on gels as well as not sequencing correctly.The nep high showed inclusion bodies but the nep low resulted in good images so we decided to use the nep low construct for all further cotransforms to be imaged.Gel.2 - Lane 2: bad cut with E Lane 3: Nep-Lo 1k3 Lane 4: Nep-Lo 1k3 Lane 5: Ladder Lane 6: eGFP-Hi 1k3 Lane 7: eGFP-Hi 1k3 Performed cotransforms of the Eut S high and low both with nep low but failed to see any turbidity in overnight cultures.Eut S lac cotransforms with the eGPF hi: 1K3, eGFP low:1k3, and Neptune low: 1K3 were carried out regardless of sequencing data.Finally, we ligated the Eut S- high, low, and lac onto PSB1C3, the bio-brick standard backbone.We redid the entire construct by repeating the gel insert of the 4A5 backbone as well as the ligation of the Eut S lac insert.We transformed the eGFP: Eut C low: 1C3 and eGFP: Eut C lac: 1C3 and Eut SMNLK: 6A1 and sequenced confirmed Eut S low: 1C3 and the eGFP high: 1C3.Due to the previous failure of the insert onto the 6A1 backbone, we once again employed the piecewise method of cloning the Eut S insert onto the 4A5 followed by a separate cloning of the lac insert onto the backbone.Colonies successfully grew of the transformed Eut S low and the Eut S high constructs on the 6A1 backbone.We PCR amplified the Eut SMNLK as well as the Eut S lac and ran overnight ligations of the Eut SMNLK, Eut S lac, Eut S hi, and Eut S lo all onto 6A1.The Eut S lac insert continued to be problematic to clone onto the 6A1 backbone because the insert and the backbone are almost identical in size.Repeated cotransforms of the Eut S high nep low, Eut S low nep lo, Eut S lac nep low, pBad eGPF Eut S lac.We used Electron Microscopy to image all combinations of eGFP and Eut S as well as the inducible pBad with various level of arabinose.Performed the cotransfoms of the eGFP Eut C low & Eut S low: 6A1, eGFP Eut C low & Eut S high:6A1, eGFP Eut C high & Eut S low: 6A1, eGFP Eut C high & Eut S high: 6A1.To remedy this, we will move all inserts from the 6A1 backbone onto the 4A5 backbone that is in the iGEM registry and repeat all cotransforms.Performed the ligation of the Eut- SMNLK, provided by the Schmidt- Dannert lab, onto the 6A1 backbone.Chose mutations at interfacial positions of the Eut S hexamer to best break apart the compartment without destroying the structure forming compartment entirely, as an intra- mutation would likely do.GENOME TEAM: Put the IPTG inducible promoter into the E. Coli genome using Gibson assembly and transformed into cells.GENOME TEAM: Cloned the CREATE libraries from muse and used electroporation to incorperate into the cell and sent for sequencing confirmation.Re-cloned the libraries as well as re-cloned in the promoter using Gibson assembly and used electroporation to transform into E. coli cells.Realized that the 6A1 and the 1K3 backbone have the same origin of replication which explained why the cotransforms failed continuously.We next began to move all fluorescent proteins over to either a Tetracyclin or Kanamyicin backbone because these are compatible with the non-canonical plasmid that we will be using in subsequent weeks.The microscopy images were inconclusive as to if the induced overnights formed better localization than the non-induced due to a strong background fluorescence.PLASMID TEAM:Took final data for cultures of EutS mutants with AzoPhe.The 1C3 backbone was taken from the 2016 iGEM registry.Performed PCR mutagenesis to change Low promoter cassette to a medium expression level, which came back successful.Lane 3 and Lane 5 look good Made ethanolamine plates to image the endogenous Eut S compartments, but no growth was found initially.We continued to try and get Eut S lac onto 6A1 by repeating the ligation of this.For the first week, the team participated in \u0093iGEM boot camp\u0094 in which we quickly went through the procedures and equipment that we would be using throughout the summer.PLASMID TEAM: More PCR mutagenesis with Q5 polymerase, two rounds total with 6 loci each.Purchased Phusion polymerase for main lab, as this was the suspected culprit, with primer length and affinity the suspected problem with the other 3 loci.Sequenced the Eut S Mid overnights prior to PCR mutagenesis and imaging of this construct.Used the k808000 (pBad modified with an RBS that includes a GFP protein) from the iGEM registry and sequence confirmed our modification to the protein.We will try these next with the addition of thiamine (vitamin B1) to promote growth of the DH5 alpha NEB cells in the media.", "protocol": "", "result": "We will also continue to attempt to create these compartments on the native EutS compartment of our NEB-5alpha E.Coli using our mutation library; this would enable easier growth of compartments at scale, as well as prevent the cells from losing the plasmid in media.Several issues occurred during our first attempt at the three plasmid system, which we should like to avoid if we were to repeat the experiment.Two-Plasmid System localizes fluorescent proteins We used standard BioBrick plasmids pSB4A5 and and introduced high (BBa_314100), low (BBa_314100), and lactose (BBa_K314103) promoters with the EutS compartmental structure protein (BBa_2129001), along with a EutC1-19 tagged enhanced GFP fluorescent protein (BBa_2129003) on pSB1K3 with the same high and low promoters as well as an arabinose inducible promoter (BBa_2129006, 007).Mutation of EutS Sequence to introduce Amber stop codons Using site directed mutagenesis, we changed the sequence of our EutS Low plasmid construct to instead use a Mid promoter, and we introduced amber stop codons into the sequence of EutS at residues that we selected based on predictive protein modelling with Rosetta and Pymol.Sequencing confirmed that several of these plasmids were successfully mutated at the loci we selected, including the part EutS Mutant C (BBa_2129002) which we characterized more fully with our three plasmid system and fluorescent microscopy.Additionally, we would explore the possibility of incorporating EutS and the fluorescent protein we switch to onto the same plasmid now that we have a good idea of which expression levels are most efficient.Once sequenced and confirmed for incorporation of amber codons at desired sites, we performed a co-transformation of eGFP Low (BBa_2129006) and the pEVOL AzoPhe plasmid provided by the Shultz lab, and then introduced our mutated EutS Mid plasmids via electroporation.Amber codon mutation into the sequence of the EutS gene was sequence confirmed at five loci, all of which were transformed with the prepared two-plasmid e.coli and viewed under fluorescent microscopy.We have tested and demonstrated the results of different expression levels of our EutS compartment with variable levels of tagged eGFP using a variable two-plasmid system and a variety of promoters (BBa_K2129003-K2129007)3.We introduced a 3-plasmid system using the AzoPhe pEVOL plasmid and then visualized the results of adding irradiated phenylalanine-4\u0092-azobenzene to the medium of cells with the mutated plasmids5.Fluorescent microscopy demonstrates increased localization of fluorescent proteins when the EutS plasmid is present.Introduction of azo-phenylalanine amino acids to EutS structure Using QuikChange PCR mutagenesis, we introduced Amber (UAG) stop codons to the EutS sequence at residues predictively modelled to produce super and substructure altering effects.Construction of the EutS BioBrick compatible part Using the part EutSMNLK (BBa_K311004), we PCR amplified out the S protein of the operon and cloned it alone onto a plasmid backbone.The best results can be seen with EutS with a low cassette (BBa_2129006) and araC-Pbad (BBa_K808000)under non-arabinose added medium using Luria-Bertani broth (this is documented behavior on the parts page for BBa_K808000).Fluorescent microscopy of the tri-plasmid system without mutation produced similar results to the two plasmid system with successful growth in tri-antibiotic media, confirming the viability of the three-plasmid protocol.With reduced efficiency from the control, eGFP localization was still notable in the mutant-plasmid transformed cells, suggesting successful incorporation of phenylalanine-4\u0092-azobenzene (AzoPhe) into the EutS structure.A three plasmid system has the potential to cause problems with successful transformation of E.Coli, so switching to a single plasmid expressing both would cut down on potential failures and also reduce the need to use as many antibiotics.As is evidenced by our microscopy, many E.Coli cells would grow far past the length of a healthy E.Coli, which we believe is largely due to the use of Ampicillin.Upon confirmation of gene presence and function, we performed high-throughput mutation to attempt to reproduce our two-plasmid expression system with genomic transcription, introducing an IPTG-inducible promoter in lieu of the normal ethanolamine operon induction into the genome.Localization of the EutC1-19 - eGFP system was tested with low, high, and arabinose cassettes on pSB1K3.Testing using our two-plasmid system has demonstrated that EutS does indeed produce localization of EutC tagged fluorescent proteins, as described in Schmidt-Dannert et al.We successfully mutated amber stop codons at at least three loci in the EutS gene4.Genome modification of NEB 5(alpha) cells for IPTG-inducible Eut expression Genome sequencing of the NEB-5alpha cells used for all our cloning was performed to confirm the presence of a functional e.coli Eut operon.Due to the considerable time-latency this procedure requires, we did not successfully produce functional mutants at the time of the competition, but we did produce a mutation library and transformed our cells.These results demonstrate that the standard BioBrick promoters and plasmids are able to produce similar results to those previously discovered, with some possibility of reduced fidelity and frequency of \u0091misbehavior\u0092 by individual cells.Localization was always noticeable with good levels of EutS expression, however, cells would frequently overexpress eGFP resulting in sporadic cells being extremely fluorescent and making visualization of surrounding cells more difficult.", "safety": "", "keywords": "resistance expression metabolism chaperonin engineered

"description": "Using the rankings we have maximized and minimized codon context for two ORFs, sfGFP and mRFP to test if there is a correlation between single codon, codon pair frequencies and protein abundancy.According to the criteria that each group has to fulfill in order to get gold medal, we improved function of two biobricks, which we delivered to the iGEM Registry in 2015: one arabinose induced promoter- Arashort1 (araBAD; BBa_K1741000), and one xylose induced promoter- XylS (xylA-proD5 UTR; BBa_K1741009).Considering that the additional ribosome binding site in 5 UTR seems to be an universal mechanism which allows for an efficient polysome takeover in E. coli and possibly in other procaryotic systems, it opens new attractive opportunities, at least to develop very efficient expression systems for other bacteria like Bacillus, Lactococcus, and many other.Degeneracy of the genetic code means that some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, thus the same protein sequence can be translated from various mRNAs.Moreover, cellular RNA polymerase is more accurate and introduces less mistakes in the transcribed sequence than that of phage origin from pET system, which is important if one\u0092s aim is to produce recombinant proteins for crystallography and medicine.Our group modified arabinose, rhamnose, xylose and melibiose promoters, from which AraC-pBAD arabinose promoter is commercially available.Our biggest achievement this year is the experiment in which we have transplanted a 39nt fragment of 5 UTR of gene 10 of bacteriophage T7 to three of four (melibiose inducible promoter is still under construction) tightly regulated E. coli promoters.We decided to check what is the difference in the protein synthesis rate between two very different versions of the same reading frame- sfGFP [Pedelacq JD, 2006], one composed of the most common codons (sfGFP-B, the best choice) in E. coli orfeome and another codon-monotonous as well but composed of the rarest ones (sfGFP-W, the worst case).Considering that translation in prokaryotic cells occurs on just transcribed mRNAs, slower cellular RNA polymerase can be beneficial for an accurate translation of mRNAs with stronger secondary structures, which have lower chance to form before ribosomes will cover the nascent mRNA molecule.Our group, UAM_Poznan, aims to generate four sets of promoters induced by sugars: xylose, melibiose, arabinose and rhamnose, and give the user the possibility of introducing numerous genetic circuits into one cell, which expression can be independently controlled.We have reduced promoters  size \u0096 they are minimal but fully functional and tightly regulated.We have also introduced changes in 5\u0092UTRs (untranslated regions), as 5\u0092UTR regions with their secondary structures and 16S rRNA binding sites of different sequence and location regarding AUG codon are known to strongly influence the efficiency of translation.Our latest activity focuses on trials to find out to what extent the structure of an open reading frame (ORF) can be optimized and what is the difference in translation rate of let say optimal, less optimal, and much less optimal reading frame.In the presence of glucose, cAMP levels are low and CRP is unable to bind to the promoter, which results in blocked transcription.Our multipromoter system provides differential levels of protein expression, so one can choose either stronger promoter, or the one ensuring lower levels of inducible expression.; A novel sequence element derived from bacteriophage T7 mRNA acts as an enhancer of translation of the lacZ gene in Escherichia coli.These year\u0092s improved constructs are as follows: BBa_K2014003 - pBAD-M5 UTR->sfGFP \u0096 improvement of pBAD promoter (BBa_K1741000) with M5\u0092UTR,BBa_K2014004 - pxylS-M5 UTR->sfGFP - improvement of XylS promoter (BBa_K1741009) with M5\u0092UTR.All constructs contain sfGFP under different promoters/UTRs- as a marker of gene expression and protein synthesis/accumulation.For more information about these improvements see our Results and our BioBricks  main pages: BBa_K2014003 and BBa_K2014004 We have also

sugars: arabinose (Ara promoters), rhamnose (Rha promoters), xylose (Xyl promoters) and melibiose (Mel promoters).Further experiments concern examining codon context effect, a hypothesis claiming that the translational efficiency of a given codon depends highly on its neighboring codons.Right now, pET lactose/IPTG induced T7 RNA polymerase dependent system, which enables high efficiency of protein production, is the most popular one.The frequency of particular codons in the gene of interest can cause expression problems because of rarely occurring tRNAs.sfGFP_B and sfGFP_W constructs differ within all codons with the exception of the first ten residues that correspond to a stable N-end as a 6-histidine tag, which is often used for affinity purification of recombinant proteins.We have substituted original 5\u0092UTRs of genes located downstream these promoters with synthetic sequences considering RNA structure, the RBS motif and its positioning.We would like to check which approach to optimize a reading frame is the best and to what extent it can improve the expression of the optimized gene.We have checked if four rare arginine codons (namely AGG and AGA) added to the 3  end of GFP reading frame will influence its translation.Song S., Park C.; Organization and Regulation of the D-Xylose Operons in Escherichia coli K-12: XylR Acts as a Transcriptional Activator.Roles of Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein and the Carboxyl-Terminal Domain of the a Subunit in Transcription Activation of the Escherichia coli rhaBAD Operon.(1995) Effects of rare codon clusters on high-level expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli.These factors are dependent on the binding of the catabolite receptor protein (CRP)-cAMP complex to the promoter.Promoter is induced by a specific sugar and starts the expression of a gene.The choice of a proper promoter is a factor highly affecting protein expression.It appears that all fusion promoters (araE1, xylE1, rhaE1) are still much tighter than the lactose induced T7 systems and all fusion promoters are much more responsive to inducers.According to bioinformatics analysis we indicated 7 codons that occur in E.coli genome with the least frequency rate.It is believed that by codon optimization one can substantially increase the gene expression and that the optimized gene will more effectively compete for cell resources and will be more accurately translated [Kane JK, 1995].Journal of Bacteriology, Nov. 1997, p. 7025\u009670329.Journal of Bacteriology, June 2000, p. 3529\u009635357.We have prepared four different codon context rankings: one based on whole orfeome and three different sets of coding sequences for high abundant proteins.However, it has some downsides: the system is leaky, so proteins toxic for the host cell cannot be produced.Its leakiness is very hard to control once the stable and highly active T7 RNA polymerase is produced.Hans Peter S\u00f8rensen, Kim Kusk Mortensen., Advanced genetic strategies for recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli.Since all four sets of promoters are tightly regulated, they can be useful in production of proteins toxic for E.coli cells.E.co-Factory ensures independent induction of expression of at least two different genes and efficient blockage of all promoters by glucose.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We\u0092re glad to say that the conference was a big success for our iGEM group!We intend to spread the word about our iGEM project not only among students and other iGEM groups, but also among scientists connected with molecular biology in general.In the course of our project, we had the pleasure to spread synthetic biology among high school students who are the most valuable future source of innovation - who knows, maybe one day they will form another great iGEM team and come up with life-saving ideas.We have organized several workshops combined with laboratory classes.High school students don\u0092t really know synthetic biology and most of them met this field for the first time during our workshops, probably because of the high specificity of the field and the fact that high school curriculum doesn\u0092t contain this topic.The program of the workshops was divided in two parts \u0096 a theoretical part where teenagers listened to a presentation about synthetic biology and, of course, safety (how to work in the lab and not to hurt yourself).We\u0092ve received lots of advice and suggestions and won second award for the best poster (the poster about xylose-induced promoters).What young people think about socially important topic \u0096 GMO?As a part of the XIXth Poznan Festival of Science and Art and the Night of Biologists, we have organized workshops entitled \u0093Not all that glitters is gold \u0096 on the fluorescent proteins\u0094.Our iGEM group is not only focused on working in the laboratory, we also want to share the amazing synthetic biology experience with others - teach people about possibilities connected with this field and encourage them to expand the boundaries of their own mind.After The Night of Biologists we received an e-mail from a few students from one of Pozna?\u0092s High Schools.Almost half of the respondents (46%) thought that they know what synthetic biology is dealing with but only 55% of those were able to give definition of this field.Combining fun with learning is the best way to spread knowledge about molecular biology and learn safety rules of working in a laboratory.In the meantime students prepared agarose gel and performed protein extraction.Next places went to zoology (11%), molecular biology (7%) and new generation drugs (7%).Majority (93%) knows what the GMO abbreviation stands for.In March (18-19.03.2016) we had a pleasure to participate in scientific conference \u0093Biological problems of the modern world\u0094 organized by Student Scientific Circle of Naturalists (Ko?o Naukowe Przyrodnik\u00f3w, KNP) at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna?.First place went to Maria Sk?odowska-Curie (40%), the second place was taken by Albert Einstein (29%), what was not very surprising \u0096 the former was a double Nobel prize winner and the latter is probably the most known scientist of all time all over the world.The results of extraction and gel electrophoresis confirmed that the students have good abilities to work in laboratory.Both the extraction and the PCR were a great success!The Night of Biologists is an event organized every year in January at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna?.The biology teacher from Turek\u0092s High School was impressed with our workshops during Pozna?\u0092s Festival of Science and Art.The first group started at 4 p.m. and the last one finished at 11 p.m. We hosted both organized as well as young people keen on science or even parents with teenagers.There was an anniversary cake, speeches of former Presidents and members of the KNP and the motivational talk from the Dean of our faculty.At the conference, our group presented our iGEM work in details during oral presentation, which was given by Julia Zieli?ska with Daria Niewiadomska, and during poster session, where we presented two posters.During the workshops participants worked with our iGEM constructs, including promoters induced by sugars and learned basic molecular techniques used in laboratories.The most interesting field of biology in students\u0092 opinion is genetics (27%), then animal physiology (17%) and biotechnology (15%).One of the teenagers wrote about his teacher, what must be a real appreciation of his work!The results were similar for the question about using drugs produced with GMOs \u0096 70% agreed, 17% had no opinion and 13% disagreed.We have also requested to write down the pros and cons of GMO.In January 2016 we hosted a group of 18 ambitious students from a biology and chemistry-focused high school class.We were interested in the opinion of the young people about socially important and rough topic \u0096 GMO.We are glad that we could expand the knowledge of young people in some of the important and socially turbulent topics.She asked if there is a possibility to organize the same workshops for other students interested in molecular biology.In the next part we focused on extraction of GFP (or RFP) from E.coli and agarose gel electrophoresis.In the end we asked participants to fill in a questionnaire we had designed.However, we know that the best way to learn something is to do it by yourself.Marcin presented the production of miraculin protein in E.coli cells and won 2nd place in the poster contest.All of them were high school students from Turek (41%), Bia?ogard (17%), Zb?szy? (17%) and Mi?dzyrzecz (24%).Marcin Osuch was the author of the second poster, at which he indicated practical use of our expression system.Our team members explained lab safety rules and the possible ways to assemble genetic constructs.Students were also able to perform electrophoresis in agarose gel, which is used in molecular biology to separate DNA fragments.One half preferred to work in groups (47%) and second half would rather work individually (53%).We have also asked the teenagers to name a famous scientist of their choice.This meeting aimed to celebrate 95th anniversary of the KNP Science Circle and to gather students- members of science clubs from other Polish Universities, in order to share work, exchgange ideas and start the collaborations.A very famous Polish cardiologist, very important for the Polish medicine - Zbigniew Religa, who died few years ago, was also mentioned.On the other hand, threats that students see included superweeds, threats to biodiversity, human diseases, allergies, uncontrolled expansion, genetic mutations and diseases, tumors, death of natural species and unknown reactions to foreign DNA.She won 1st place in the Best Poster Contest.As a result workshops for three 16-people groups took place at our university on 17th June 2016.All the respondents were from 15 to 25 years old.Most of them considered themselves to be \u0093scientific minds\u0094 and only 9% identified as \u0094humanistics All of them attended a high school program with extended biology and chemistry curriculum.Most of high school students know what GMO means and what the abbreviation stands for.This time we hosted a lot of students from Pozna?\u0092s high schools.In our laboratory we hosted 5 groups, 16 students each.We decided to organize four laboratory workshops for high school students.Furthermore, we described all stages of recombinant protein production and then they also performed protein extraction from E.coli.We also told them about synthetic biology and described our iGEM project.Half of them (54%) declared to accept genetic modification, 39% had no opinion and only 7% disagreed.They attended the final year of a biology-chemistry class and they were keen on molecular biology.Asked for using GM animals in study of human disease pathogenesis most of them (74%) agreed, 17% had no opinion and 9% disagreed.It is nice that young people know not only a world-known scientist but also a Polish one.Each practical class ended with a quiz about synthetic biology.Their friend had taken part in our laboratories and they asked if it is possible to organize a meeting for them too.Each student performed their first PCR and amplified different parts of our iGEM genetic constructs such as promoters, protein-coding sequences.60% of students viewed themselves as extroverts, 36% as introverts and 4% of teenagers had no opinion.Many of them have no opinion on using GMOs, possibly because of incomplete knowledge or contradictory information from different sources \u0096 school, politicians, internet, television.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "After cutting the bands from the gel and cleaning them on columns \u0096 we performed the CPEC reaction!This week we repeated the experiment and compared three versions (sfGFP, sfGFP_Best, sfGFP_Worst) of green fluorescent proteins production on three different media: SB/PKB, 1xLB and M9 minimal medium.Next day we measured the fluorescence of the samples on Tecan (See: Methods) to check the difference in protein production between two versions of GFP.We compared the fluorescence of all variants of the green fluorescent protein (sfGFP, sfGFP_Best, sfGFP_Worst) under wild-type arabinose promoter (araBAD-araC) on 3 media: 1xLB, SB/PKB and M9 minimal medium.Then we isolated plasmids from single colony and sent them to sequencing laboratory.In order to have glycerol stocks, which are necessary for further experiments we performed 17 electroporation with 17 different constructs!It was a lot of work but hopefully everything went perfect and next day we obtained colonies on solid LB dishes.Next day we prepared cultures (we started from OD600= 0.4) and add xylose to the final concentration 0.4%.This week started with good news- sequencing confirmed the sequences of genetic constructs of GFP_best and GFP_worst under arabinose promoter!We introduced the isolated plasmids to E.coli DH5? by electroporation.In the richest medium- SB/PKB there isn\u0092t any change in fluorescence intensity between all sfGFP versions.We also introduced two variants of RFP to E.coli DH5? by electroporation.We used the cultures from the previous day to inoculate 1xLB and M9 minimal medium with 0.4% arabinose.We have successfully obtained another two constructs: RFP_Best and RFP_Worst under the arabinose promoter (araBAD-araC) (BBa_K1481002).Those two variants of sfGFP and primers with overlaps were ordered in IDT at the end of the week- now we are waiting\u0085Our exams at the university have finished and we can concentrate on iGEM project!In the morning we started culturing the bacteria in 1xLB and M9 minimal media with 0.4% arabinose.When we obtained all fragments needed to assembly our constructs, we performed CPEC reaction to obtain two constructs.This week we started from desalting the CPEC products on silica columns.Below you can see the photo made under the Blue light.To verify the sequence of our arabinose promoter and GFP_Best/Worst we isolated plasmids and sent them to sequencing laboratory.We also performed the PCR to amplify the arabinose promoter and the vector (pSB1C3).The fluorescence was measured during 6h culture in three medias (1xLB, SB/PKB, M9 minimal medium) with 0.4% of arabinose.This week we obtained the list of codon pair frequency rankings.To check the production of different versions of sfGFP under xylose promoters we inoculated 1xLB, SB/PKB and M9 medium with previously prepared stocks.At the end of the week we created charts according to fluorescence measurements on Tecan.We were continuing with measurements\u0085 Our instructor sent as a few interesting publications about the influence of sequences on 5\u0092 or 3\u0092 end of ORF on protein production and stability.Next day the fluorescence was measured on Tecan- and the results were similar to the previous ones.We also amplified arabinose promoter (AraC-pBAD) (BBa_K1481002) and visualized the PCR products under UV light after electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel.We cut out the bands that represented the desired products and purified them on silica columns.We measured the fluorescence and we could observe differences in fluorescence between RFP_Best and RFP_Worst not only on M9 minimal medium but also on 1xLB.The samples were collected every hour during 6h of culturing in the same way as already described (See Methods).At the end of the week geneblocks of RFP_Best and RFP_Worst came to our lab!We prepared cultures (we started from OD600= 0.4) and add arabinose (inducer).We performed PCRs to amplify halves of RFP_Best and RFP_Worst with appropriate overlaps in order to create constructs built of mixed versions of RFP.The scheme of the procedure is shown below.We were very surprised by the results- they showed that a simple translational circuit can easily adjust and produce GFP protein in richer medium irrespectively of codon content!Both the geneblocks and the primers were ordered in IDT.This week we spent on computer to engineer two different variants (Best and Worst) of green fluorescent protein (GFP).This week we received primers from IDT so we started from PCRs.The results from sequencing laboratory confirmed sequences of GFP_Best and GFP_Worst under xylose-induced promoters (XylWT, XylE1)- we have another two constructs.The first half of coding sequence is made of the most frequent codons and the second half is built from the rarest ones and vice versa (the scheme of the constructs is shown below).We came up with an idea to check the intensity of GFP production in SB/PKB medium (See: Materials), which is a richer medium than 1xLB.Next day we took one colony from Petri dish and inoculated 1xLB medium for overnight.All the IDT fragments and geneblocks came to our lab!The same day we also introduced the constructs to E.coli DH5? (from New England Biolabs) by electroporation.Next day we started from purifying the CPEC products and electroporation of E. coli cells.Then we performed CPEC reaction to assembly the constructs.To check the intensity of two GFP versions we transferred a few randomly picked colonies on Petri dishes with 0.4% of arabinose and chloramphenicol to induce GFP expression.The same week we also isolated plasmids and sent them to sequencing laboratory to confirm the sequence.Two versions of sfGFP were amplified using primers with overlaps designed in NEBuilder.We can\u0092t wait till our further experiments!It was a \u0093planning week\u0094- we were wondering, which constructs should be assembled.Based on the special software- the Codon Pair Bias measure (created by our advisor- Melania Nowicka) she designed fluorescent proteins ORFs built of the most or least frequently codon contexts.Our iGEM project started at the beginning of June.Then the products were separated on agarose gel to confirm the appropriate length.We cut out the bands from the gel.The same day primers with overlaps were designed and ordered from IDT.In order to assemble constructs with those variants we designed primers with overlaps in NEBuilder.Next day we inoculated liquid LB media to prepare glycerol stocks.", "protocol": "", "result": "In contrast to rich media, in M9 minimal medium the codon optimization based on codon usage is important so probably E. coli cells cannot quickly biosynthesize minor tRNA molecules and keep up with translation from ORF composed of the least frequent codons with same efficiency as optimized ORF.We have found that there is no obvious difference between sfGFP translation encoded by optimized codons (which are the most frequent in E. coli orfeome) and the inversely optimized ORF composed of the synonymous rare codons in E. coli cells growing in rich media (SB/PKB or LB).2, 3, 4) suggest that in E. coli cells rich media, the introduction of rare codons into a sequence coding for a well soluble protein, expressed at a moderate level (like in pBAD systems) is not sufficient to observe any significant decrease in the rate of its translation.Translational rate of different variants of sfGFP ORFs during 6h culture of E. coli DH5? in the rich medium \u0096 LB upon induction with L-arabinose (0h) (0,4% final concentration).We decided to check what is the difference in the protein synthesis rate between two very different versions of the same reading frame, one composed of the most common codons which occur in E. coli orfeome (sfGFP-B, the best choice) and a very different codon-monotonous as well ORF but composed of the rarest codons (sfGFP-W, the worst case) (Fig.Translational rate of different variants of sfGFP ORFs during 6h culture of E. coli DH5? in the richest medium \u0096 SB/PKB upon induction with L-arabinose (0h) (0,4% final concentration).Instead of arginine residues, sfGFP_TagX has a degradation tag at before stop codons (coding for a decapeptide sequence: ANDENYALAA), which is added to defective mRNAs devoid of stop codons, by translation of tmRNA which binds to the vacant A-site on a stalled ribosome and directs the truncated protein to proteolysis [Hayes et al, 2001].We wanted to check to what extent such four consecutive codons could be detrimental to the biosynthesis of a stable and soluble recombinant protein in E. coli.We have created another four constructs with sfGFP_B and sfGFP_W composed of exclusively the most frequent or the rarest codons in E. coli orfeome under both wild-type xylose induced promoter and pxylS-E1_5\u0092UTR.Much of the codon-usage literature focuses on inefficient translation of a set of rare codons in E. coli [Kane, 1995] especially those for arginine, namely AGG and AGA.In M9 minimal medium the codon optimization based on codon usage is more important because the translational apparatus has to adjust in E. coli cells and biosynthesize the less common tRNA molecules.The synonymous codons in protein coding genes are not necessarily random; codon usage bias is correlated with imbalance in the tRNA pool.To overcome this problem and enhance the expression of \u0093difficult\u0094 ORFs containing rare codons there are available special E. coli strains like BL21 Codon Plus [Rosano GL, Ceccarelli, 2009], which encode additional tRNAs and recognize these codons.The translational rate of sfGFP from inverse optimized ORF is higher or equal to sfGFP biosynthesized from the most frequent codons.Further experiments concern examining codon context effect, a hypothesis claiming that the translational efficiency of a given codon depends highly on its neighboring codons.In order to check if the same results can be observed in the case of a fluorescent protein of a different sequence and structure we designed two variants of mRFP coding sequence.Thus, the codon optimization is necessary to adjust the synthetic gene\u0092s sequence to replace rare codons with codons occurring in efficiently translated mRNA in host\u0092s transcriptome.Translational rate of three different variants of sfGFP ORFs transcribed under control of weak and strong xylose-induced promoter during 6h culture of E.coli DH5? in LB medium upon induction with D-xylose (0h) (0,4% final concentration).The results present significant decrease in the translation rate from inverse optimized ORF (mRFP_W) comparing to the optimized one (mRFP_B) not only in M9 minimal medium but also in both rich media (SB/PKB and LB) after 18h of E.coli DH5? culturing.We decided to check to what extent codon optimization based on orfeome influence the sfGFP biosynthesis under another induced promoters to be sure that what we observe is not dependent on the choice of the arabinose induced promoter.Codon optimized - composed of exclusively the most frequent codons in E.coli orfeome (mRFP_B) and mRFP_W - composed of synonymous rare codons (mRFP_W).Translational rate of three different variants of sfGFP ORFs during 6h culture of E.coli DH5? in M9 minimal medium upon induction with L-arabinose (0h) (0,4% final concentration).This is the result of degeneracy in the genetic code, which means that some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, thus the same protein sequence can be synthesized by various mRNAs.The sfGFP_W composed of the rarest codons is efficiently translated at the low/moderate level (under control of pxylF-xylA promoter) (Fig.The opposite situation is observed between sfGFP biosynthesis under control of stronger promoter (pxylS-E1_5\u0092UTR is most likely the strongest available version of a xylose-induced promoter in E. coli (See: BBa_K2014002).(2009) Rare codon content affects the solubility of recombinant proteins in a codon bias-adjusted Escherichia coli strain.The ranking and the ORF scores are calculated using the Codon Pair Bias measure (see Methods).Surprisingly it appeared that there is no clearly visible difference between the rate of sfGFP reading frame under identical promoter with an identical 5\u0092UTR (biobrick: Ba_K1481002 provided by Poznan_Bioinf as well) and sfGFP_4R biosynthesis.The set of biobricks composed of different variants of sfGFP reading frame under identical arabinose promoter (AraC-pBAD) starting from the stable 6-histidine tag at the N-terminus.According to the software, Codon Composer, designed by our advisor, Melania Nowicka, she calculated a codon pair ranking for any set of ORFs and optimized the codon context considering restriction enzyme sites and other aspects at the same time.Since the difference between translation efficiency of codon optimized and inversely optimized ORF based on whole orfeome codon usage is not big we continue our investigations to test codon adaptation index and codon contexts.Codon optimization based on orfeome still leaves many questions unanswered and that\u0092s why we are looking for any other general way to optimize ORFs.According to bioinformatics analysis we indicated 7 codons that occur in E.coli genome with the least frequency rate.First construct dedicated to this phenomenon was sfGFP with four rare arginine codons located before its two stop codons TAA (sfGFP-4R-Ba_K1481003 biobrick provided to iGEM in 2014 by Poznan_Bioinf team).We are working now on contrasting ORFs, which are AT or GC rich, with codons optimization based on codon adaptation index.Protein expression was induced at OD600= 0,8.Our results were difficult to believe because many people wanting to improve translation of heterologous protein optimize synonymous codon usage to better match the host organism.The results of translational rate obtained from fluorescence measurements were referred to non-optimized sfGFP coding sequence (BBa_K1741007 and BBa_K2014002).(1995) Effects of rare codon clusters on high-level expression on heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli.This indicates that E.coli translational apparatus can be easily adjusted or that such a gene takes advantage of this that it uses a different tRNA pool than highly expressed proteins do at the same time.(2001) Stop codons preceded by rare arginine codons are efficient determinants of SsrA tagging in Escherichia coli.Variation in codon usage is considered to be the major problem in heterologous protein production.We have chosen two other promoters from our collection: a rather weak promoter - pxylF-xylA (wild-type xylose promoter) and a strong one - pxylS-E1_5\u0092UTR.", "safety": "This company, specialized in DNA synthesis, is constantly checking ordered samples\u0092 quality in respect to biosafety and regulatory conformance; so that the procedure of production could be easily disrupted if biohazardous material is detected.Each member of our team had some previous experience in working in a lab.As it\u0092s presented in report of Kopernik Science Center, there is an acceptance for the use of GMOs for the production of drugs but according to genetic modification in the area of the animal world, there is a clear opposition.Let\u0092s focus on the field of biology and describe bioethics, which is- ,,a field of study concerned with the ethics and philosophical implications certain biological and medical procedures, technologies, and treatments, as organ transplants, genetic engineering, and care of terminally ill.\u0092\u0092 Working with genetically modified organisms (GMO) has a tendency to lead to difficult ethical issues in society.Before the project\u0092s start day, everybody had to read special safety protocol that describes how to work with different chemicals and with Genetically Modified Organisms, how to use protective equipment and what to do in case of emergency.Furthermore, the location of fire extinguishers, first aid kits and emergency showers in the laboratory were shown by our instructor.Bacterial cells used during our project were maintained in the lab; they do not cause any risk to the environment.So that\u0092s why we are responsible for raising public awareness, for telling them the truth about synthetic biology and GMO, telling about advantages and disadvantages.Actually, the main ethical issue can be associated with ,,playing in God\u0092\u0092.But also, what seems be an essence of ethical problem, some of them (47%) thinks that this is an unacceptable intervention in the order established by God.2.According to results published by CBOS (Public Opinion Research Center) from year 2013, we see that the majority of Poles (65%) claim that the cultivation of GMO should be banned.There must be a balance between detriment to these organisms and the benefits for humanity.,,A branch of philosophy dealing with what is morally right or wrong\u0092\u0092 -this is one of the common ethic\u0092s definition but there are many, many more, depend on the field of interest.Some people, sometimes even scientists, are convinced that genetic engineering and creating GMOs are wrong because it is the interference into the natural, divine order.Two-thirds of responders would use the drug on the basis of GMOs to save his own life.What kind of ethical issues could E.co Factory project have?Taking under consideration the fact, that working with bacteria is more acceptable than working with vertebrates, our research should not be criticized.As we already know from our survey (you can see the results in HUMAN PRACTISE tab), people usually do not support the GMO.Bacteria transformed with our constructs were decontaminated before removal, either in our laboratory by adding an appropriate disinfectant, or by packaging for decontamination in the special autoclave.Simultaneously, majority of respondents claim that this kind of food has a negative influence on human\u0092s health.It generates important ethical question: \u0091What is the right balance of risk and potential benefits?\u0092.Going back to ethics, working with living organism is always a controversial issue.In Poland GMO is mainly associated with the food products based on the GMO crops.To some extend it is true, we interfere with nature, but we don\u0092t do it for fun!More than a quarter of responders would use such a drug in order to improve the quality of life.Most people are afraid of consequences of eating GMO food: new diseases and allergies (76%), uncontrolled genetic changes in humans (67%), uncontrolled intervention in nature (71%).", "keywords": "aeruginosa pSB1C3-Orikan transcription microcysis Shiga-like

synthesis of protein of interest is another important step.To achieve cellular aggregation, we use the famous auto-transporter protein, Antigen43 (Ag43).With the advent of rDNA technology in the late 1970s, medicine, agriculture and several other areas underwent a quantum leap and from that point, progress only hastened, from one only one recombinant pharmaceutical approved for human use (insulin) in 1982 to one hundred and fifty-one FDA approved protein based recombinant pharmaceuticals by 2009[1].Despite being in high demand (due to the fact that most recombinant products produced on an industrial scale are therapies for chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes), recombinant products are expensive due to several factors like long and expensive development time, high failure rate (~80%) of the products developed, manufacturing costs requiring expensive technologies and processes (bioreactors, column chromatography, sterile conditions, etc) and the involvement of skilled labor on both the manufacturing and the healthcare provider\u0092s side[2].Hence, we engineered our bacteria in such a way that it could do most of the work done by these monstrous machines so that we no longer have to buy them and pay their bills.To increase the yield of the product, we came up with the idea of separating cell growth and target protein production so that when the cells have grown up to a high enough cell density, they shuttle all their energy towards the required protein production [4].Hence, we engineered our bacteria in such a way that it could do most of the work done by these

modify E. coli to lower capital and running costs for rDNA bioreactor systems, by automating protein over-expression induction and separation of cell from growth media.To learn more about the existing biotech infrastructure in India, we decided to visit some biotech parks in India and explore the feasibility and applicability of our idea.As stated in the summary, we found that the bioreactors in these parks had no sensors, centrifuges or any level of automation.It is also displayed below.We had a sit down on July 27th, 2016 with top officials at the Government of Karnataka\u0092s (GoK) (the state in which our institute is located) department of Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science and Technology and presented to them our idea and its applications.We presented our project and its possible implementation in the government biotechnology parks which are lacking in machinery for automation and downstream processing, some of these processes can be performed by our BioBricks, which can effectively replace or supplement these expensive machines.The intent was to convince our government representatives of the need for enhancing the current government biotechnology facilities and a possible option of doing so.The novelty of using Ag43 for clarification of cell cultures and using this to replace or supplement energy and capital expensive centrifuges and its application in conjunction with auto-induction using quorum sensing made our idea patent worthy in their opinion and hence, to continue our research, the GoK\u0092s biotechnology department granted us ~$9,000 towards consumables for our project.We found that the bioreactors in these parks had no sensors, centrifuges or any level of automation.", "modeling": "$A_t$ -- Threshold amount of quorum sensing molecule (Adjustable parameter, by changing affinity of quorum sensing molecule for the switch) $n_f$ -- Final number of bacteria in solution (at threshold) $r$ -- Rate of production of quorum sensing molecule per bacteria (Adjustable by changing promoter)Since the bacterial is in the log phase, the number of bacteria at time $t=t$, if the initial number of bacteria was $n_i$ is, So, the rate of production of the quorum sensing molecule, if the rate of production by each bacteria is $r$ is, Rightarrow A_t = frac{rn_i2^{gt}}{g} = frac{rn_f}{g}\\ Now, expressing $n_f$ in terms of $n_i$, and taking the time to reach threshold is $t^*$, Rightarrow t^* = frac{1}{g}log_{2}frac{A_tg}{rn_i} If we modify our equation slightly to incorporate the fact that production at $t=0$ is $0$, we get, A(t, n_i) = frac{rn_i}{g} left( 2^{gt}-1 \right)\\ Rightarrow t^* = frac{1}{g}log_{2}left(frac{A_tg}{rn_i}+1\right) Considering the fact that the switch takes time $t_s$ to work, A(t^*+t_s, n_i) &= frac{rn_i}{g} left( 2^{g(t^*+t_s)}-1 \right)\\ &= frac{rn_f2^{gt_s}}{g} - frac{rn_i}{g} \text{ (because $n_f=n_i2^{gt^*}$)} The cell density after the switch turns on is $n_f $.So, To achieve initial density, $n_i$ again, the fraction to be removed is, frac{n_f -n_i}{n_f } &= frac{frac{A_tg}{r}}{frac{A_tg}{r}+n_i} + frac{n_ileft(2g^{t_s}-1\right)}{left(frac{A_tg}{r}+n_i\right)2^{gt_s}} Let us assume the cells secrete product for $t_p$ amount of time after the switch is turned on.At $k^*$, $frac{dP}{dk}=0$, but this is insufficient to say that $k^*$ is a maxima of B (just a critical point is proved).Thus to maximize product formed per unit total time (one cycle time), we just maximize its numerator P. P = pleft(frac{A_t g}{r} + n_i\right)2^{gt_s}left(C-frac{1}{g}log_{2}left(frac{A_tg}{rn_i}+1\right)\right) Defining $frac{A_t}{r}=k$, (please note that $A_t$ and $r$ are adjustable) we can write $P$ in terms of $k$, and take its derivative with respect to $k$.However, since there is only one critical point, and $frac{dP}{dk}$ at $k^*$, when $k^*>0$ is also positive, it implies that $B$ increases from $k=0$ and $k^*$ has to be a maxima.Using this result, we derive the optimal $k$ (for highest $B$), $k^*$ makes biological sense only if $gC>frac{1}{ln2}$, otherwise $k^*< 0$, but $gC$ is the number of generations of division and secretion which is expected to be much greater than $sim 1.5$ (rough value of $frac{1}{ln2}$).When $B$ is maximum, $frac{dP}{dk}=0$.Let us assume that the product is produced at a per-capita rate, $p$.So, $t_p = C - t^*$, where $C$ is the constant.It was assumed that the synthesis of autoinducer molecules is negligible before the log phase in the bacterial growth curve kicks in, and also that after protein protein production begins, the cells practically stop dividing.The constraint on $t_p$ and $t^*$ is that their sum is a constant for a given amount of media, since it basically represents the nutrient content.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "The results of our experiments can be found in the following pages.", "safety": "1)

an entirely new output of novel materials for defense and biomedical purposes.We were very honored to represent iGEM and the silk engineering field to the wide public through our interview!In addition to our laboratory work exploring the vast usefulness and potential properties of silk, we were strongly inspired to look at the societal and environmental implications of our actions.Third, while synthetic biology as an emerging field has revolutionized the biotechnology industry and inspired hundreds of scientists to pursue biological engineering interdisciplinary methods in their investigations, there is a severe lack of public knowledge in the field.If you are interested in using our lesson plan for future synthetic biology outreach to abide a variety of secondary level

where they think the science of silk can take us in the future.We hope that by discussing the basic science and displaying the simple techniques used to construct these synthetic silks, that we bridge the gap between understanding the intrinsic artistic properties of silk, and the power of the engineering principles that derive them.To expand upon our collaboration with local silk artist Jason Fahrion and the UCLA Art|Sci Center, we were graciously invited to deliver a lecture and workshop at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, entitled Natural Discourse: Flora and Fauna, where we discuss the connections between art and science within the framework of botanical gardens and natural history collections, like silk.We were fortunate enough to meet with David Breslauer, CSO

potential silk structures to assay for putative allergenicity.In order to analyze whether our processing silk samples are free of transgenic bacterial contamination as a byproduct of genetic silk

circuit is very difficult.Chemotaxis consists of two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrates different behavior when the bacteria are exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial or harmful to their metabolism and reproduction.When absence of chemical, there is no molecules bind to the chemoreceptors, cheW, an intracellular

overexpression of OprF in E. coli will drastically improve the antibiotic absorption capability, like antibiotic condensation occured in E. coli.Viroporins are similar to porins in which they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occurs between hydrophobic, transmembrane and alpha-helical domains of the proteins.SCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope

directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.In order to produce slight deformation on the polymer film, we need to find a proper material to make it.Then, bacteria will still swim but not tumble.Because of lack of natural chemoreceptors for antibiotics, we need to construct a genetic circuit specifically to sense antibiotics,

improvement bacteria, CACCI in a more convenient way, we will provide CACCI in powder.Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic circuit.When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depends on the structure of gRNA.The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains physiologically improved of their cell bodies or genetically enhanced capacity of mutagenesis and geneBecause of such horizontal genetic exchange, nowadays, efficacy loss may attribute to the emergence of many antimicrobrial-resistent strains.The head of the drill can be replaced by many part such as saws or polish-head.Oh, all parts should be fixed with hot-melt adhesive (hot glue), in order to maintain stability.In farms or hospitals, solution containing ecological equilibrium of bactierial colonies and sidelong threaten public health.Because individuals neglecting antibiotic emission, rivers in China now encounter substances for human(48%) and animal(52%) in 2013, which is tenfold usage of USA and antibiotic substances in high concentration can be detected from many river basins that evaluation, antibiotics can be detected in all rivers in China in different degree.As figure-1 shows, the system SPRING includes Optical part, Hardware part and Software part.Finally, target gene such as LuxlCDABE will be engineer Bacteria I to release quorum sensing molecules to Bacteria II for exponentiallyTo achieve antibiotic concentration corresponding to AHL production, AHL produced by Bacteria I will be regulated by antibiotic substance sensing promoters.In general, bacteria tumble in the absence of chemical.When presence of chemicals, cheA is free from cheW interaction, and cheZ will efficiently remove phosphate group from cheY.He helps CACCI in three aspects, which are the optical aspect, the hardware aspect and the software aspect.Besides, these proteins as well play an important role in the resistance against attack by human complement system.As a result,It is notable that this second level amplification module won t directly expand the signal intensity, in another way, it will indirectly enlarge the resolution of different antibiotic concentration gradients.In NDM, there is a system for measurement: CACCI which contains chemotaxis modified bacterial adhered to a polymer membrane.The former one is regulated by Lux complex and produces cI inhibition protein and the latter one will be inhibited by cI protein and EGFP will be expressed when lack of cI protein.Consequently, this genetic amplification circuit, compare with others, will not directly enhance the intensity of GFP expression but toThe design intention on bacterial membrane permeability improvement is directly from part of mechanism of antibiotics resistance.For example, in E. coli, AcrAB efflux system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty.It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance, that is to inhibit the function of efflux system.The model is illustrated as following:Our CACCI construction is systematically not only including chemotaxis modification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.Theoretically, bacteria won t receive antibiotic substance because of mutation of its transmembrane protein and efflux system.Besides, using traditional genetically modified circuits to express report is still time-consuming, comparing with generalConsequently, we originally established CACCI based on chemotaxis and interference to make a larger level of antibiotic molecule detection, even a detection for other chemical molecules.Among these rivers, the Pearl River Basin in South China and Hai River Basin in North substances were discovered in these rivers, one of them, for example, in the Pearl River Basin, amoxicillin was found at 3384 ng/L and fluprofen at 2867 ng/L.Although, antibiotics in the river samples, its feature is also deficiency: that is such strong specificity may hurt extensive measurement.Artificial synthesis of sulfonamides, quinolones and oxazolidinones enrich theAs the matter of fact, microbiotics, the great saver of our life, is now putting us inEmergence of antimicrobial resistance is theoretically predictable by evolutionary potential.When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA.When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA.Plus considering cm squared film, we need the Young s Modulus of the film is less than 1GPa.(Attention: the LB liquid medium should contain glycerol which is used for cryopreservation.At last, the software analyses them and transmits the results to PC.However, facing that large scale contamination, complicated routine and trained personnel cannot be satisfied at all districts, so do it in many developing and undevelopedAlong with ROSE, CACCI embedded in SPRING will be used to detect antibiotic.These maximal induction of each promoter strain is tested in the course of 10h ofThe mechanism of these promoters are different from each other.Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments that is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief).Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments which is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief).This phenomenon is based on the interaction between the positively charged polymer and negatively charged cells or proteins.Since the discovery of penicillin by British biologists Alexander Flaming in 1929, the antibiotic family has been enlarged a lot.In China, the overuse of antibiotics for animal is the same serious as the clinical therapy.Spring s hardware, based on Raspberry\u0096Pi, allows spring to take photos or videos of the fringe.Though lack of standard ranking on antibiotic contamination, according to environmental scientistsNow, many technology including ELISA, Delvotest, HPLC-MS/MS, CE and Quantum Dot are able to detect antibiotic concentration in river sample, however much of their have muchNot portable, many big and automatic equipment are indispensable for concentrationComplicated Routine, which requires trained personnel to conduct experiment.The overexpression of OprF they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occursSCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria.CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transferThe Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson.Our theoretical modeling also illustrate a higherOur ROSE construction is systematically not only include quorum sensing and logic amplification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.This is achieved by \"shifting\" the signals between stages within the device one at a time.Later, phosphate will be transferred to cheY and the phosphorylated cheY associates with the flagella motors making flagellum rotates clockwise.During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to 3.MicF: An Antisense RNA Gene Involved in Response of Escherichia coli to GlobalTherefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with an optical interference path, recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.Based on a Raspberry-Pi, hardware part can take photos or videos of interference fringe, then our software analyses them or transmits to your PC.With treatment of IPTG, LuxR will be constitutively expressed to ensure LuxR-AHL complex willIn addition of signal amplification through quorum sensing, an artificial genetically engineered cascade magnification circuit is also implemented in ROSE construction.In this cascade signal circuit, LuxR-AHL complex trigger the activation of promoter Lux, then express cI derived from ? phage.As for E. coli, a gram-negative bacterium, whose surface is formed by lipopolysaccharides(LPP), which is negatively charged at physiological pH.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We hope kids can possess a memory about the mechanism in biological world and the seed sowed by us can prosper in the future.Finally, a panel session was beginning: This session is for students and adults to know iGEM, establishment and history of our team built in 2007 and the future of synthetic biology and biological technology.This is the beginning of our integrated human practice in April.Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and governance of antibiotics in China: This is a main human practice activity closely related to our project.They all hoped these incredible jobs would make more contribution to our human being, environment and the earth.In April 27th to 28th, a theme activity called Saving earth, saving water was established in University of Science and Technology of China.We saw their perfect work in necklaces, and we also enjoyed their smiles during the activity.After people had saw the tiny bacteria and DNA in a large scale, it was time for them to know about a latest track of biology\u0097synthetic biology, and iGEM, the most important platform for youths to know and develop syhbio.With the explanations by the leader of our team, kids began to know the basic principles of synthetic biology.We iGEM team, cooperating with Encoding Life Association (ELA), Natural Conservancy organized promotion and introduction to the public.At the beginning, our host briefly introduced the situation we human-being encountering in China.We hope our human practice would deliver the public fresh ideas on scientific researches as well as build a communication bridge between public need and the frontier of science.The first two things about biology coming up in people\u0092s minds must be bacteria and DNA.I do not know much about synthetic biology, I think it might undermine the law of natural evolution.USTC: Probably, ethics is a very important issue, let\u0092s take the X-Men for it, I think if there is a group of people with specific abilities in the world, maybe the order will be destroyed.As is often the case that the boss is out of sight, people can only notice the tiny part of the pollution while the primary is obscured\u0097because people can never believe that certain antibiotics, sulfamonomethoxine, for example, used on the animals in their plates can be a hundred times more than that on themselves.The data show that only 1% of people know the concrete condition, and the rest 99% of people are only guessing or even totally unaware of the consumption of antibiotics of China.So we can see that people know a little about the dangerous resistance via media, but their concept about this severe problem is still vague.In regard to the techniques to detect antibiotics in water, people seem to be blind, let alone the difficulties we meet in the specific detection of the types and the concentration of the antibiotics.They are not only curious about make their own genome necklace, but felt cool on the mechanism of DNA introduced by our members.Then, our team members briefly introduced iGEM and our projects to the audience.It is pretty good to share our gains and losses with them and enlighten the kids who are interested in science.Then, the leader held a small class for the kids: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for kids to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures.Nearly half of the people hold an optimistic attitude on the antibiotics residue in food and drinking water.When asked about the source of the pollution, more than 80% believe that the major blame of the antibiotics residual should be hospitals, but in fact, the usage on human is only 16%, while on veterinary, 84%.General biotechnology and previous iGEM projects on water cleaning are included in the lecture, as well as our draft ideas about nanomachines detecting trace antibiotics in water.USTC: That is actually molecular biology did not play a significant role in animal protection?sNC?I certainly believe that molecular biology and ecology are closely connected, but generally speaking, science develops focusing on the needs of society, for example, pharmaceuticals.The activity finally attracted hundreds of people joining us, which made such big contribution to evoke public cognition on water and other environmental issues.Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and administrating of antibioticsAntibiotics are widely used on both human and animal in order to defense the illness caused by bacteria.Saving water, a lecture for iGEM: An introduction of the situation of waste and contamination of water around the world nowadays to the public.Leader of USTC, Juntao Yu introduced the basic molecular biology mechanism and iGEM to high school students who were deeply intrigued in biology.The leader firstly introduced the daily laboratory apparatus to the kids and students such as centrifuge, vibrator, PCR Instrument, high pressure steam sterilization pot, incubator and etc.We still believe few can influence many with their constructive suggestions and going into action so that one day people in China, even all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.CineCom, movie community of University of Science and Technology of China, is interested in communication with our iGEM team.We tried our best to eliminate the gap between the fast developing science and puzzled people even if we finally managed to influence few.We hope our work will make a great contribution to letting more people know iGEM, synthetic biology, and believe the fact that we benefits a lot from genetic engineering technology already!It indicates that a number of people neglect the side effect that the abuse of antibiotics may cause.More than 95% of them know that antibiotics can cause antibiotics resistance.Thus, further publicity is needed.According to the last part of the questionnaire, although few of them have heard of synthetic biology, they are positive about biological techniques in detecting antibiotics.We gathered data about people\u0092s awareness of the issues of antibiotics contamination in China.In our human practice section, we combined general biology, molecular engineering and synthetic biology with public health, policies, art, movies, education, environment and society.In fact, the superheroes are human beings with specific features, perhaps one day, synthetic biology can realize the superhero story.So this is not an individual can decide, but will reach a uniform height in the future.sNC?For eco-propaganda, public misunderstanding about it is just like the one about genetic engineering.These are some applications of the techniques, but not science researches.And in 2013, China even consumed half of the antibiotics in the world.This year iGEM, along with ELA, delivered an integrated human practice (IHP) activities for the public.As for the species under the threats of human destruction, humans should not look for ways to protect them just to cover up their bad damage to them.We are surprised to know that children are aware of the word DNA, while they hardly understand the essence of it.CineCom: I think nowadays science fiction superhero plays the main theme of the majority of these movies because such script does not need too deep excavation, but only gorgeous special effects, which can gain substantial box office.Can we preserve the genomes of the extinct species and use them to culture new ones?We explained the mechanism of some of them and we were glad to see some middle school students caring about the working mechanism of centrifuge.In April 14th, we USTC iGEM along with our supervised Encoding Life Association (ELA) held a lecture on water cleaning technology based on common physical and chemical technology as well as some biological engineered technology.So we continued teaching them more about the physic theories in it.For the endangered species, if they cannot adapt to the natural changes, humans cannot help them, either.The abuse of antibiotics is the ringleader because it causes antibiotic resistance.CineCom: From the perspective of evolution, the evolution of our abilities is to meet the real needs.Maybe next time we could try on our epithelial cells!A lecture on general molecular biology, synthetic biology and iGEM was held in August.USTC: Yes, but haven\u0092t the superheroes started to tiring us?People judge things based on subjective preferences of decision, and therefore does not comply with the laws of nature.Nowadays, the unsupervised discharge of antibiotics arouses a big concern about their negative impacts on ecosystem and human health.For example, at paramecium stage, we can only engulf and divide; until the evolution of adult classes, we have the ability to build and engineer.We iGEM team established a club in our university called Encoding Life Association (ELA), especially for science education for children in China.Synthetic biology, a new method, promising it is, we believe it will have wonderful application in solving antibiotics pollution.This year, we continued developing our online account in Facebook and Weibo.Children wrote down their dreams on our broad, some of whom proudly promised that they would join in iGEM, were they admitted to university one day!In order to make our audience better enjoy these galleries, activities, we designed dozens of questions.This activity firstly sent fundamental knowledge and mechanism of DNA extraction for the attenders.sNC: With the reduction of wetlands, and the destruction of the habitats of the migratory birds, the birds are facing unprecedented pressure to survive, not only birds, many other species\u0092 extinction rate is higher than last century.USTC: Certainly.Since recently the public in China is concerned about GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) severely, we want to directly and briefly introduce to them the genetic engineering technology and let them judge whether the GMO is safe for our daily requires with our guidance.Now, we invited their leader Mr. ChungKim Whang.sNC: The main activities of natural conservancy of USTC are bird observing and cradling.Consequently, there is great necessity to make the crowd acknowledge of the proper usage of antibiotics.Isn t it fun and cool?Attempting to attract more contemporary and children on synthetic biology, we built an activity called Come and extract the genome of strawberries with our kitchen materials.Then they started extracting DNA from strawberries according to the protocol we had prepared.sNC?Molecular biological researches on genes provide us with a better reference of classification and explanations of the reasons for extinction from the microscopic point of view.Cross Talk: Now we are expanding our connection from the public to the professionals.Putting it into tiny bottles as the pendants of the necklaces.One of a sci-freak major in organic chemistry in USTC laughed in those following words,That was incredibly amazing!This survey is really important in the promotion of antibiotic pollution and antibiotic resistance.How fast do the birds extinct around the world?However, the improvement in medical conditions extend humans life span and promote humans well-being.So there are lots of collaborations in the progress of filming and screening.For example, the black hole in Interstellar and the theory of clone in Orphan Black?I think this is precisely the potential threat of the \"super heroes\".According to our project, we held a water saving activity and launch a questionnaire survey.But only very few of them care and get to know about whether the pollution of antibiotics approaches to our environment and our daily life.We do not pay enough attention to the treatment of animals suffering from the disease, because generally it seems to follow the laws of nature, sick and old animals should be eaten by predators, so that evolution goes forward.Many people said, taking part in this activity made them better and deeper understand the magnificent work that synthetic biology could achieve.During this lecture, our team member introduced some intriguing methods that provided by previous iGEM teams, including genetically modified phytoremediation of TU-Munich 2013 iGEM team and biological replacement of heavy metal ion contamination in water.A brief introduction of iGEM: A general introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology lecture for high school students.We usually start from the child, giving lectures in primary schools.And we found those children quite imaginative on synbio, neural science and molecular biology.Our simple interpretation on our chemotaxis and interference approach is so fascinating that many adults strongly changed their perspective on genetically engineered bacteria and molecular biology.So, we provided the opportunities for people, especially kids, to get access to megascopic bacteria and DNA, which are usually invisible, just as they are called as microorganism and molecules.", "modeling": "Consider in a current area S, the density of bacteria on surface is ?, and during a interval dt, the change of bacteria density is d?(Sdsigma =K_{a}\times (1-frac{sigma }{sigma _{0}})\times dN-K_{d}\times Ssigma dt)Where Ka is the adhesive rate of each hit, Kd is the drop rate of the adhered bacteria.Then, after solving this Ordinary Differentiate Equation, ODE, we got the equation shown below,(sigma (t)=frac{K_{a}CV_{z}sigma _{0}}{KCV_{z}+K_{a}sigma _{0}}\times (1-e^{-frac{K_{a}CV_{z}+K_{d}sigma _{0}}{sigma _{0}}\times t}))According to this result, the density of bacteria at time t is related to adhesive rate of bacteria Ka, concentration of bacteria c and velocity of bacteria Vz.And we can let (frac{K_{a}CV_{z}}{K_{d}sigma _{0}+K_{a}CV_{z}}) equals an integrative constant, K. In addition, we cannot start recording the image data the moment we put the bacteria on the cover glass in reality, so there should be a time delay in our modeling.Also give some irreplaceable constructive opinions and key indicators on the operation of detecting the concentration of antibiotics.Vz: Average swiming speed component in the z axis, which is perpendicular to S.(m/s)and irrespective of contacting with each other when swimming, we are able to conclude bacterial movement is free.(V_{z}=int_{0}^{frac{pi }{2}}V\times cos\theta \times frac{dS}{S}=int_{0}^{frac{pi }{2}}frac{V}{2}cos\theta sin\theta d\theta =frac{V}{4})Consider during the interval dt, in area dS, there are dN bacteria in tiny volume (dS \times V_{z}dt) hitting the wall whose area is S. Schematic image illustrates the process mentioned above,Because the number of bacteria in solution is much more larger than it on the glass surface whose area is S. So the concentration of bacteria (C) can be regarded as steady during the measurement period.Assuming the number of hitting wall bacteria is stable, the surface can only adhere one layer of bacteria, that is the place which has already adhered bacteria can not stick any more bacteria.Results are delivered below:It is interesting that we could know the \"Initiation moment\" through our data analysis, which is very cool.Another intriguing and important property we got through our data analysis is the adhesion ability(Bacteria to Cover Glass)(AA-B-CS in brief).According to the fitting results and modeling equation, the derivative of the fitting function at the beginning(t0) is the bacteria number growth rate in its maximum.Assuming the rate of stick (P) is constant, the movement percentage of bacteria will present in an exponential form changing through time.According to the fitting results shown above and equations, we could get some useful information when operating NDM, such as,Because we can not start recording the image data the moment we put the bacteria solution on the cover glass, so there is a starting time delay in the equation.After solving these equations above, we ultimately get the Young modulus of material required G <1GPa in order to get ~um order deformation.Therefore, we selected several materials as possible films: low pressure polyethylene, rubbers, and glass as our material of the film.Just think about it, if every bacteria pull together, we can detect the deformation even the film is made of steel and even bigger than steel.This part introduces the data of adhesion experiment, makes exploration and interpretation on bacteria adhesion dynamics.According to the simulation result, when  m  reach 95% of its maximum or minimum value(frac{K}{K+k}), t~100s.Consequently, we recommend user to get the results in NDM, you should wait approximately 100s after putting film into optical path.This part explains the fundamental principle of our detecting method - interference.This explains why we emphasize both bacteria and film material when we defined this parameter.Note: The bacteria solution in  HCB1-PLL(+)-0  sample was not the same with other samples, so the AA-B-CS value is much different with other s.Surprisingly, we found that the concentration of antibiotics doesn t effect the AA-B-CS in our assay, which suggests that we are able to use the same type of bacteria treated with antibiotic in different concentrations, which is another important theoretical base of our NDM.Through the pre-test and data in paper, we use 20ug/ml poly-L-lysine coating the film over 4 hours or overnight at the temperature 4? eventualy.Because the motility of bacteria will decrease when we do not administrate antibiotics.We got the best interaction time is the moment when the number of movement bacteria reach the maximum value.Thus we highly recommend the Bacteria-film intraction time(Ti) is approximately 100s after treating with bacteria solution, which means since you inoculate the bacteria about 100s, you should put the film into your sample solution and determine its antibiotics concentration.In test \"PAO1-PLL-0\", the bacteria solution was culture overnight in 37?(which means the bacteria was in platform stage).One thing need to know is that the different clip we implement in our pre-experiment will get different fringes.In the pre-experiment1 (you can read protocol of our pre-experiment in annex showed below).In the pre-experiment2 (you can read protocol of our pre-experiment in annex showed below).As the deformation range(h) is much more smaller than the radius(r) of the film (h<<r),Because the area of CCD camera is relatively small, whose size is ~cm x cm, the interference pattern is approximately paraxial spherical as well.Ideally, light path sketch should be as follows.Thus we got the accurate equation depicting the density of bacteria time t as,(sigma (t)=Ksigma _{0}\times (1-e^{-frac{K_{a}CV_{z}}{Ksigma _{0}}\times (t-t_{0})}))In order to fit the data conveniently, we change the equation form into a more general one,This program is used to calculate the amount of bacteria and get the percentage of moving bacteria, which is essential for our further research.As the deformation range(h) is much more smaller than the radius(r) of the film(h<where f is the resultant force of the bacteria, F is the tensile force in the film, h is the deformation distance, r is the radius of the film,?r is the variation of the radius, which is r, d is the thickness of the film, G is the Young Modulus.The thickness(d) of film is 0.16mm.Then, we are able to get Young Modulus, a critical physical parameters to depicting the characteristic of film candidates.Assume that 1% of bacteria are push ahead statistically, then the additional pressure given by bacteria is (Delta P=0.01 \times sigma F_{0}).Assume the radius of film is r, deformation range equals h.The film is subject to several forces acting, including force f given by bacteria and tensile force F through the film.Let s get some approximation on this model.Assume the driving force of the movement of single bacteria is (F_{0}) in horizontal plain.Where f1 means the resistant force bacteria containing in water solution, k is a constant called drag coefficient at this conditions.Besides, in the gravitational field, if we consider bacteria dragged by gravity in solution, then the static equation is revised as below, Where rho represents the density of solution, V indicates the extra volume of liquid immersed with bacteria, g means the acceleration of gravity.Then, in accordance with the data in previous research, the speed of bacterial movement(((V_{1}))) is approximately ~10(mu m)/s, while the speed of bacterial sedimentation(((V_{2}))) ~(mu m)/s.And considering the size of single bacterium, assume bacteria as cylinder, whose diameter equals 0.5um and length is 1~3(mu m).This part starts with the bacteria movement ability, analyze the interaction between bacteria and the special film, and obtain the requests of the material properties eventually.The interaction between bacteria and film is essential for our work.(Light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film).However, in reality, because the virtual image of holophote and the film can not be set strict parallel in actual situation, the light path sketch becomes like below, where light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film.We could use the method of coordinate transformation to simplify them as follows, where light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film.where r is the radius of the film, h is the deformation length of the film, a is the length of each side of the CCD camera, ? is the slip angle between the film and the holophote which we estimate.Using these parameters, we simulated the interference fringes image as following,How amazing our model is !More details on our coding using Matlab please refer to 2015 USTC in Github.Calculate a self-adapting or special threshold value in the image binay progress.Now we got the theoretical bacteria density variation formula and an efficient program to demonstrate the real number of bacteria on film.Simulational result just hit the row image we got before!Consider the reflect surface was not strictly parallel with the CCD, and the angle between the surface and x/y axis is ?/?.So we can know the optical path differences and light intensity distribution on CCD areUse matlab to simulate the interference pattern, and the result showed as following, When bacteria pushing the film and making film deform, the angle between film and axis will change.diluted bacteria solution 50 times.If we want to observe the deformation of the film, the bacterial additional pressure on film should reach a stable stage.Solving these equations, we are able to get Young Modulus, a critical physical parameters to depicting the characteristic of film candidates.The film is shown in black edge and the clip that used to fix the film presents in green edge.Through the modeling of bacteria adhesion, we can get some characteristics important but difficult to directly measure on bacteria adhesion and reaction to antibiotics.Calculating with all data, consequently, we concluded that driving force of bacteria is (10^{-13} N) by solving the equations.Firstly, let s check the geometric size of our special film I.So we defined this derivative value as the adhesion ability of the bacteria solution to cover glass, or call it AA-B-CS for short.This equation told us AA-B-CS relates to Ka, the adhesion rate of bacteria on every hit, C, the concentration of bacteria solution, Vz, the average swim speed of the bacteria.Because of the same interaction between solution and bacteria, in gravitational field, bacteria share the same k with the horizontal movement constant.Assume the motor ability of each bacteria does not change.The thickness(d) of film is 0.1mm.Assume the numerical density(?) of bacteria is ~(1000 /mm^{2}), which means a single bacteria occupying the area of approximately ~100 (sim 100 mu m^2).The wavelength of laser we used is 650nm.The film I is a circle with the radius(r) of 2cm.Give a method to process the interference image and calculate the deformation of the film in a high precision.Our experiment is initiated from interference fringes pattern formed naturally.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "The more fluorescence intensity we got, the more permeable theHere s our results, the first picture illustrate the total fluorescence intensity to 335nm and emission wavelength range is 370nm to 410nm, which is recommended by other hand, the fluorescence intensity in E. coli BL21 with T7-OprF (BBa_K1593210) and E. are respectively 207322 and 151820, which are significantly larger than the wildtypeThough we have already got the exact data on NPN uptake, we still need to revise itsAfter correcting these data, we are able to get bacteria absorption uptake capability in the contrary, the fluorescence intensity revised by bacterial concentration in E. respectively 85282.60 and 62195.8, which are relatively 2.5 folds and approximately 2Consequently, through NPN uptake assay, we are able to conclude that the small molecule uptake capability of bacteria improved after our genetical modification.In the same way, characterization of E. coli BL21 with SCVE, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1593667 are showing 19% decreased maximal cell density and 18.5% decreased maximal cell density permeability, at least the overexpression of OprF and SCVE with a strong promoter T7, won t significantly influence the bacterial growth.Thus E.micF and SoxS, these two antibiotic substance responding promoters were extracted[Figure 3: fragment extraction of OprF and Lac](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1593997)Figure 4: plasmid construction of lac-cheZ

relatively low optical density as its OD600 after 9 h is 2.3 compared to the wildtype.Besides, owing to the existence of ?-galactosidase in bacteria, a more intense optical density we detected, that means there are more ONPG uptaked by bacteria.Consequently, using this feature, we are able to characterize bacteria permeability by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the bacteria solution.Based on these, we know that the concentrationsFrom this figure, we can see a rising trend in all bacterial solutions.We can infer that the absorbtion of modified bacteria is higher than the wildThere is a more visual figure for comparing the absorbtions.These two Figure 5: Extraction of gRNA-AceB and gRNA-EmrE, two fragments are synthesized by Sangon Biotech Company Figure 6: Construction of T7-SCVE

And then the measurement of wildtype.Therefore, using ONPG weNote: The wavelength for detecting the bacterial concentration and absortion of ONPG areFirst, we detected the bacterial solutions to control the initial concentrations.In the same way, characterization of E. coli BL21 with cheZ (BBa_K1593997) not induced by IPTG showed a slightly smaller OD600, as its finally turned to 2.1.See how

are conducting biological experiment or not.This lecture is really important for a professional expert to conduct experiment not only following basic and regular rules but also protecting themselves.Our team members designedly studied The Regulations of Agriculture Genetically Modified Organisms Safety as well as The Regulations of Pathogenic microbial laboratory biosafety, in order to check whether we meet relevant local and national safety standards and offer biosafety training to every member in the wet-lab.Meanwhile, to keep us safe from hazardous chemicals and organisms, personal protective equipment, such as gloves, respirators and lab coats, were required during the experiment.Before the experiments started, we fully prepared for the biosafety in lab.When conducting experiments and assemble NDM, level A should be satisfied always.Class B: In level B, personnel should not only wear lab coat, but wear nitrile gloves or latex gloves, which are necessary when touching bacteria solution.Even all the parts have been proved no harm to the public usage, we still take genetic safety into consideration.Microorganism auxiliary to the device (CACCI) is genetically engineered E.coli, carrying micF, SoxS, Cas9, CheZ and OprF.This procedure is the first step for detection.Class C: Level C is the standard protocol for personnels when drilling.Even leaked to the environment, they are not competitive enough to survive and threaten the environment and public health.This protection guide is especially for people who are interested in making NDM their own or who will use NDM for material detection.Microorganism will be conglutinated to the film and then encapsulated.And please do remember ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES to prevent possible hurts and DO NOT WEAR GLOVES because it is not convenient when drilling.Class D: This is the most complicated protective measure for spraing painting procedure.This year, none of the new parts will raise safety issues for further applications in the current knowledge.During all the experimental period, the regulations were obeyed.P. aeruginosa is classified to BL2 so special attentions were paid to the relevant experiments.Please pay attention to personal safety when doing experiment:Class A: Fundamental protective measure when producing NDM and conducting experiment.One should wear lab coats, along with goggles, masks and gloves to toally protect oneself considering extreme pungent odor volatilizing when painting.To prevent possible hurt, those safety methods are defined by ourselves.When you are

expressing RFP and E.coli expressing GFP.As predicted by the developed consortia model and in the individual species cultures, the initial growth rate of the E. coli in the co-culture was significantly higher than the growth rate of C.crescentus.The first step in the development of successful co-culture conditions is to select defined media that would support the growth of both E.coli and C.crescentus and allow optimization of cellulose degradation to occur.Due to its accommodation of both species, M2 minimal media was chosen for our cultures.To determine the compatibility and co-culture dynamics between E.coli and C.crescentus, an experiment was attempted to determine each species relative prevalence in culture as a function of time.That would allow us to separate the bacteria in consortia and get insight into their ratio over timeFigure 2: Growth of C.crescentus and E.coli and their co-culture in M2 minimal media with 0.2% glucose over 60 hours.The co-culture growth of both species indicates, in the absence of substrate limitation, E.coli and C.crescentus are compatible and there is no unexpected negative impact on community growth: a successful co-culture between E.coli and C.crescentus is possible.The co-culture growth of both species indicates, in the absence of substrate limitation, E.coli and C.crescentus are compatible and there is no unexpected negative impact on community growth: a successful co-culture between E.coli and C.crescentus is possible.Co-cultured cellulase-displaying Caulobacter with ?-carotene producing E.coli to demonstrate a functional proof of concept of Crescentium project.Microorganisms live in complex microbial communities in the wild, in which individual species with specialized phenotypes interact and cooperate with each other to perform complex metabolic functions.2014) permitted successful growth for both E.coli and C.crescentus, although slow growth rates for both species was a disadvantage for this media.And last, as we defined the growth condition, we could start co-culturing Caulobacter displaying cellulases with E.coli producing ?-carotene to confirm that our consortia can be efficient for direct transformation of lignocellulosic biomass in useful products.E.coli expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) and C.crescentus expressing red fluorescence protein (RFP), seen in Figure 1, were inoculated at an initial OD600 of 0.01 with feed stock of 0.2wt% or 11.1mM glucose in 96-well plate and the plate was incubated at 30C in a Tecan platereader.For this, we decided to design a microbial consortia to separated metabolic processes between two members - Caulobacter and E.coli.For the second part, we chose E.coli producing ?-carotene as a proof of concept because it is colored, making it easily detectable.M16 minimal media was also considered as a candidate for the co-culture experiments, however, a complicated recipe made it a poor choice for our cultures.To better assess dynamics of each bacteria in consortia we are currently growing the co-culture for 3 days and plate every 12 hours on PYE-agar media to count CFU of C.crescentus and E. coli.Another result from this experiment is the indication that the dissolved oxygen concentration must be increased in order to successfully culture and sustain a high density of E.coli using expressed cellulases on the C.crescentus surface to degrade cellulose for substrate.Presley, Gerald N. et al.As seen in Figure 2, at longer culture times, the growth rate of E.coli drops significantly while the growth of C. crescentus climbs steadily.Following nature s examples, there is an increasing trend in using microbial communities for biotechnological application due to their robustness and the ability to perform complex metabolic tasks through the division of labor(Shong, Jimenez Diaz, and Collins 2012).Successfully grew Caulobacter and E.coli in M2 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% glucose.C.crescentus p4A723 cultures inoculated into this media did not grow successfully as no growth was observed after 4 days of incubation.The goal of our project is to design a stable, robust microbial community for the production of valuable compounds from lignocellulosic biomass.Because there is no species dependence with glucose as a substrate, any negative impacts caused by co-culture should be evident with this method, and the compatibility of these species can be evaluated.The decline in E. coli growth rate, while C. crescentus growth rate is affected minimally, possibly indicates that the glucose feedstock is not completely consumed and that oxygen could be limiting in microwells at relatively low culture densities for E. coli.", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "These values were incorporated into the model to complete the required constants for operation.Figure 4: Cellulase rate determination through plotting substrate concentration as a function of time against initial substrate concentration.When the production of glucose through cellulose degradation and the consumption due to the growth of E. coli and C. crescentus are combined, the ordinary differential equation describing glucose utilization can be developed.The final model correlation can be seen in Figure 2.Equation 2: Differential Equation for Species GrowthFigure 2: Comparison of experimental data to modelled results for C.crescentus with initial glucose concentrations of 2.77, 5.56, 11.1, 22.2 M To obtain the maximum growth rate for the E.coli species, several E.coli cultures were compared to C. crescentus cultures grown at the same temperature and substrate conditions.An analysis of this plot produced ?max of 0.156 hr-1 and a Ks of 0.403 mM.Figure 1: Lineweaver-Burk plot for C.crescentus with initial glucose concentrations of 2.77, 5.56, 11.1, 22.2 M Differential equations using the Monod growth rate can be made for the change in species concentration as a function of time, seen in Equation 2.Using these experimentally determined values, ordinary differential equations for a mixed culture were developed assuming that both E. coli and C. crescentus behaved competitively and that cellulose degradation by expressed cellulase enzymes on the C. crescentus surface did not favor C. crescentus due to diffusion gradients.To model substrate limited growth, Monod kinetics provided a relationship between substrate concentration and species growth, seen in Equation 1.Using this information, the ordinary differential equation describing cellulose degradation can be developed, Equation 3.Equation 3: Differential equation for Michaelis-Menten kinetics including modification for growth rate dependency.To determine cellulose activity as a function of cell density and substrate concentration, an absorbance based assay with initial DNP-cellubioside concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL, 0.05 mg/mL, and 0.02mg/mL was inoculated with C.crescentus at optical densities at 600nm of 0.3 and 0.6.A stoichiometric factor is included before the production term to compensate for the number of moles of glucose released from cellulose or cellubiose.Equation 4: Differential equation for glucose generation and consumption as a function of time and species concentration.The developed differential equations can be combined and solved using the ode45 function in MATLAB to produce predictions for different initial concentrations of E.coli and C.crescentus.A damping function was also used for E.coli, allowing E.coli growth to match experimental data.Figure 3: Comparison of E.coli and C. crescentus growth rates in M2 media, with 22.2mM glucose in micro wells.To model the rate of cellulose degradation into glucose through the expressed enzyme activity, a modified Michaelis-Menten relationship is used.The developed codes can be obtained as a zip file here, or as a text file here .For growth where dissolved oxygen concentration is not limiting, and glucose is the primary substrate, E.coli will be the dominant species for the duration of the culture, seen in Figure 5.To supplement initial E.coli growth, a small initial glucose concentration could provide initial cell numbers, and allow increased growth overall, seen in Figure 8.Figure 7: Consortia model predictions with cellulose as the only substrate.Figure 8: Consortia model predictions with cellulose as the primary substrate and small initial glucose concentration of 2.77mM.In order to improve the selectivity and yield of E. coli compared to C. crescentus, several alternative routes are possible.Equation 1: Monod Kinetics for Substrate Limited GrowthThe maximum specific growth rate and saturation constant can be obtained for our system by evaluating the growth rates for a range of initial substrate concentrations for each strain desired in the model.With several growth rates as a function of substrate concentrations, the inverse of both the rate and the substrate concentration can be plotted to produce a Lineweaver-Burk plot.First, the rate of cellulose degradation can be increased through temperature or other further cellulase development to produce higher concentrations of glucose in the media, increasing the growth rate of E.coli directly.The experimentally determined growth rate seemed to decrease as a function of cell density, and as a result, a damping function of the inverse natural exponent to the power of cell density was included in the differential equation.With a series of biomass concentration values over a range of time, plotting the natural logarithm of each biomass concentration produces a linear plot with a slope equal to the strain growth rate on substrate.Figure 5: Initial model predictions based on growth rates without consortium data.Based on co-culture experiments, the damping factor for E.coli growth rate was increased by second power.A model has been developed to predict the growth of a co-culture dynamics of E.coli and cellulase expressing C.crescentus as a function of different cellulose concentrations, glucose concentrations and time.Since cellulase enzymes are expressed on the surface of C. Crescentus, a relationship between glucose formation, cell concentration and enzyme expression must be made.A model was developed to describe a mixed culture of C. crescentus and E.coli with cellulose and glucose as the primary feedstocks.Analysis of three triplicates for either species indicated that E.coli grew at rate greater than C. crescentus in the same conditions, a result that can be directly related to ?max.Based on these curves, the growth rate for E.coli is 3.1 times the growth rate for C. crescentus.When the Lineweaver-Burk plots are compared for either concentration, seen in Figure 4, there is no clear difference between them, indicating that concentration has negligible impact on the rate of cellulose degradation after a certain culture concentration has been reached.A prediction with modified damping factors to accommodate the observed stationary phase can be seen in Figure 6.Figure 6: Adjusted model predictions based on consortium data.In a system with cellulose as the only feedstock, growth would occur slowly and diffusion limitations could cause different growth mechanisms to be non-negligible, seen in Figure 7.The inverse of substrate degradation rate can be plotted against the inverse initial substrate concentrations to produce a Lineweaver-Burk plot.Typically, Vmax is a constant related to enzyme concentration and kinetics, however in the consortium system, enzyme concentration changes as a function of time based on the concentration of C. crescentus in the system.A culture to achieve a much higher yield and selectivity of E.coli on cellulose can be obtained by supplementing the initial culture with a small amount of glucose to stimulate exponential E.coli growth without reaching stationary phase.For a given time range, the differential equations would be discretized and solved producing the species and substrate concentrations as a function of time.The developed model predicts that growth on cellulose as the only feedstock is unlikely to be productive.In the absence of substrate limiting growth kinetics, with the same initial substrate concentration, the growth kinetics should differ based on the ?max of either species.Using a Lineweaver-Burk analysis for enzyme kinetics determined that the cellulase activity was not proportional to cell concentration at high cell densities, and thus, the only variables for glucose formation and cellulose degradation were cellulose concentration.The maximum specific growth rate of the culture, ?max, is the growth rate when substrate is in excess.These equations have been written in terms of OD600, and as a result, the yield terms can be obtained in terms of OD600 per gram or mole glucose.Instead, it was proposed that Vmax is a combination of enzyme activity, the number of enzymes expressed per C. crescentus, and the concentration of C. crescentus.To model our environment, the individual species growth, enzyme expression, and enzyme activity were experimentally determined at optimum co-culture conditions of 30 degrees Celsius in M2 media.Two constants, maximum specific growth rate and the saturation constant, are required to use the relationship.This result indicates that a consortium based on cellulose as the only feedstock is unlikely to be successful, as the cell accumulation will be low over long time periods.The combined differential equation for glucose feed stock in the system can be seen in Equation 4.Seen in our consortium results, a co-culture of E.coli and C.crescentus indicated that it s likely that the assumption of oxygen limitation is no longer valid.Two mixed culture dynamics exist in the developed consortia: competition, in which species compete for substrate, and commensalism, where one species requires the existence of another to survive.A second code, variables.m, was created to specify initial conditions, send equations specified in consortium.m to the built-in MATLAB function ode45, and plot the resulting predictions.Additionally, improving oxygen transfer may allow E.coli to produce higher concentrations of cell mass by removing the impact of the damping function.To determine the constants in our Michaeles-Menten kinetics, two Lineweaver-Burk plots are created using experimental data with two different cell concentrations and the average of the constants are used.The culture dynamics have been modelled using a system of four ordinary differential equations: one for each species, one for glucose consumption and formation, and one for cellulose degradation.", "notebook":

blue, and green [1].The software provides two operating modes: the E.coli-code mode is able to convert any given information into light-coded files, and therefore turn these files into actual light-exposure commands of the E-light hardware system.This year we the team Tsinghua 2015 attempt to store biological information into E. coli by combining the light system with the gene editing tools.Using this screening system, we can also determine the optimal distance between sgRNA pairs and length of the linker.With the assistance from the software, we can either convert a file into the binary data string which can be transformed to a light emitting pattern with a coding protocol (a pre-programmed grammar), in turn being encoded into the bacteria by a modified recombinase, or we can put in light parameters and encrypt the information into the bacteria.With the help from structural biology, we in the future might know how this system works in the end.With the help of the coding-plasmids from our CRISPR-Recombinase system, we can eventually store any information into the E.coli DNA and of course, extract the information later on through sequencing.The E-light 1.0 hardware system has 3 major components: the light-exposure & bacterial culture system, the controlling circuit and the computer interacting port.For the Cas9-recombinase system, we designed an iPTG-inducible ccdB screening system to test whether its gene editing ability is powerful or not.We took advantage of the high precision and programmability of light system and the specificity and the convenience from a Cas9-recombinase hybrid.Thus, combined with our light-switch, the user is able to gain better control over the bacteria\u0092s metabolism pathways.With this information storage platform in hand, what can we do in the future?The controlling circuit utilizes 3 AT89S52-24PU DIP-40 SCMs (single chip microcomputer) to execute programmed-controlling of the 24 tri-color LEDs, while the computer interacting port monitors the whole system through given protocol sequences.Green-light system do not represent none of two types of binary information, instead it acts as a license that allows the recombines to work [4].The E-code 1.0 software system aims to provide convenient commanding for users of the E-light hardware system.For the Cas9-recombinsae system we selected recombinase system as the tool to edit the gene due to its specificity for consensus sequences.Adding NOT and OR gates downstream the light system might render the system more complex and therefore available for better information storing capacity.We also would be able to develop better encoding algorithm to integrate more information into the bacterial genome and in a more versatile way.In order to build an information storage platform described above we devised a hardware assisted by a software that can eventually convert any form of profile into biological meaningful information.It is not hard to imagine a world where you can simply store any kind of digital information you want into the bacteria, and break the storing limitation of general electrical device.In order to utilize the light as an input signal, we have to first test its basic parameters which can be refer to.For example, we can denote the blue-light system to control information containing \u00930\u0094 whereas the red-light system to control information containing \u00931\u0094.With more delicate design and further investigation into this system, we can take our platform onto a whole new level.We adapted an engineering strategy onto these two component system by combining different modules and components from different species in order to achieve highest efficiency [2].We additionally built a model of the relationship between the light input and the protein expression output based on previous results.All being said, we still needed to first determine the basic parameter of this inducible system.Again, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out, turning out to be promising to ensure that inducible system can work successfully in E. coli.A straightforward strategy is to use light-switchable two-component system to directly control the gene-editing hybrid.We received quite convincing results to support that light-switchable two-component system can work successfully in E. coli.At present our system can theoretically encode and encrypt any form of file and convert their binary data stream into biological meaningful information, i.e.The light-exposure & bacterial culture system is based on a 24-well plate coupled with tri-color LEDs.We therefore complemented this system by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, because it is guided by a sgRNA pair that is not limited to specific sequences.Given the ideas come up with above, how can we put all parts together in order to store information within the E. coli?Using smaller Cas9 endonuclease is also a must when considering transforming the entire plasmid into the bacteria, which is actually a metabolic burden for the cell.[2] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].", "design": "The green-light system works an extremely similar way to that of the blue light system: it is comprised of two essential components, a light sensor and a response regulator.The red-light system used in our project consists of two components, a membrane-bound light sensor Cph8 and a response regulator OmpR [3].Light-switchable two-component system (TCS) is one example of how light signal can be wired into the metabolic pathway within the bacteria [3].Additionally, there are two components within: a light sensor and a response regulator, the former sensing the incoming light and responding to it by changing the conformation, the latter reacting to the sensor and turning on or off the gene expression due to its transcriptional factor nature.The principle behind light-switchable two-component system goes like this: When a beam of light hits on the bacteria, the effector module in the sensor, i.e., the HK domain, will change its confirmation accordingly, therefore its catalytic activity transits from a phosphokinase to a phosphatase.In this system, a J? chain is introduced to link the light sensor and effector together, of which the conformation change is induced, switching the YF1 (the fusion protein) from a kinase to a phosphatase.The blue-light-sensitive LOV domain in its soluble light sensor YF1 is derived from a protein termed YtvA from B. subtilis, whereas the histidine kinase domain derived from the protein FixL and the response regulator FixJ are found B. japonicum.As a result, a recombinase system is the most ideal candidate when looking for an information storing executor.Thus, the response regulator, FixJ, is dephosphorylated and deprived of the ability to drive FixK2-promotor-regulated gene expression [3].Since that there is an endogenous expression level of red-light system in E. coli, a bacterial knock-out technique is introduce to avoid a potentially confusing result [4].To be more specific, a light sensor is made up of two modules: an actual light sensor and an effector which possesses both kinase and phosphatase activity.As a result, RR cannot recognize its downstream target sequence and cannot activate the expression of the reporter gene.As is indicated by its nomenclature, this system is switchable \u0096 it has two interchangeable states when stimulated by different light conditions.With the advancement of gene editing technology, today CRISPR/Cas9 system has been exploited to carry out a myriad of functions, such as knock-out and knock-down of a certain gene, single molecule imaging, etc.It turns out that the inducible ccdB system works perfectly well, so it is competent to be used to screen the optimal distance between sgRNA pairs and an appropriate linker choice.Cas9, an endonuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes, can target and cleave specific DNA sequences that are next to the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) when provided with a guide RNA.Different light systems generally do not interfere with each other, and therefore can be stimulated and silenced in parallel [2].Here, however, the light sensor module is designated as Cyb, along with its histidine kinase, constituting the light sensor component CcaS.The light sensor is made up of a red-light-sensitive cyanobacterial phytochrome sensor module Phy derived from a protein called Cph1 from S. PCC 6803, and a histidine kinase domain from a protein called EnvZ from E. coli.Generally, two families of recombinase have been identified: the tyrosine recombinase and the serine recombinase [5].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].In this way, precise gene editing and information storing can be achieved by utilizing the light system to regulate the dCas9-recombinase hybrid.In addition, the inducible ccdB system has other potential future applications.That is to say, we still count on the specificity and accuracy of recombinase, but meanwhile we need the assistance from Cas9.We established a model of the inducible ccdB system indicating the relationship between iPTG addition and OD value after discussing parameters of iPTG, ccdB, relative concentration of bacteria, and OD value measured.After successfully constructing all the systems required and confirming its efficacy, we can bridge the light-switchable TCS and the dCas9-recombines system together.CRISPR-Cas9 system is a newly developed gene-editing tool that breaks the limit of specific recognition sites.Consequently it is regarded as a complementary DNA cutter that is not restricted to recognize unique sequences, but is versatile that can recognize any sequence within the genome guided by its sgRNA.This means that if current information storage capacity is not enough, we do not need to search for a new recombinase, instead changing the sgRNA pairs can solve the problem.Engineering Escherichia colito see light[J].Therefore, if we have to choose one form of signal as the input, the optical input is favored [1].A pair of sgRNAs targeting the sense and antisense strand of the DNA sequence guide the fusion protein to the location, and the recombinase part of the fusion protein carries out deletion or inversion of the DNA segment.The blue light system follows similar principles, containing two components as well.Of course, it is easy to understand why we then turn to Cas9 and see if it can overcome the specificity issue from recombinase issue [6].There are two commonly used gene-editing tools: site-specific recombinase and CRISPR-Cas9 system.Following the guidance of sgRNAs, Cas9 endonuclease can be used to modify any site of the genome conveniently.Along ccdB\u0092s sequence we designed 25 and 24 sgRNAs targeting each strand of the DNA.However, accurate deletion or inversion, a vital aspect to consider when devising an information storing platform, are hard to accomplish because of double-strand breaks introduced by Cas9 endonuclease.With this new tool we don\u0092t need to bother considering and introducing recognition sites of the recombinases anymore.Also, without causing double-strand breaks, gene editing can be safer and more accurate [6].In other words, a major drawback of this information-storing platform is that every time a new recombinase has to be used when increasing the storing capability.[1] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].The response regulator is derived from OmpR of which the recognition site is a promoter named OmpC.Site-specific recombinase is an endonuclease that is capable of inserting, deleting and inverting a DNA fragment within the recognition site.In our system, three mainstream light systems we took advantage of all follow this basic scheme.Second, easy access and low cost renders light system frequently used.Effects of different designs of linkers are also tested using this inducible ccdB system.We built an inducible ccdB screening system for it.Refactoring and optimization of light-switchable Escherichia coli two-component systems[J].The sensor and the effector interact closely in order to give a precise light-induced response.Recombinases were previously utilized to accomplish information storage in biological systems due to its specificity [7].Although the screening work wasn\u0092t finished, a linker choice and distance between two sgRNAs worked finely.Three types of TCS are now the most commonly investigated, including red, blue and green light system, named by at which wavelength the system is responsive.Addition of iPTG induces expression of ccdB and then bacteria get killed, but if ccdB gene is successfully disrupted by dCas9 recombinase, then the bacteria survive.[7] Yang L, Nielsen A A K, Fernandez-Rodriguez J, et al.", "human_practice": "In addition to our telling the story of iGEM and some previous interesting projects, we encouraged them to form several temporary teams, which enabled them to exchange their preliminary ideas relevant to feasible iGEM projects.The most impressive part came when the representative of every group shared the amazing thoughts of their discussion, and those brave students were awarded with small souvenirs.The public we targeted to were mainly consisted of three groups listed below: students from other iGEM teams, freshmen from the School of Life Science in Tsinghua this year and some high school students who showed great interest in our project and daily experiment.Freshmen major in Biology always look forward to their research life in the future with enormous passion every year.At last, we received many reflections and encouragements written on the leaflet from them, which made us feel even more hopeful when thinking about

communication between teams was realized while we got helpful advice at the same time.We decided to create a chance for high school students to experience experiments in the lab after we got to know their desire for practical attempt based on theoretical knowledge learned in class.Contacted successfully on May 18th, these senior three students from RDFZ visited the lab on May 24th for the first time.Several days in May and June spent in the lab with them, we introduced significant lab safety rules and basic molecular experiments.Xiao Yangbo and Zhao Yiqing, two of our team members, attended

concentration of lac operator is proportional to its plasmid concentration, therefore: (5) There are two states of lac operator, the one bound and in turn inhibited by lacI (or lacIiPTG) and the one unbound, the concentration of which are denoted as:  (6) Given that lacI and lacIiPTG will compete for binding to lac, we can therefore deem it as two thermal equilibrium: Notice that because iPTG

GFP, will be expressed when bacteria carrying this plasmid are provided with blue light.Add gradients of 0.1% iPTG to bacteria suspension.In this experiment, we used a recombinase system to insert a Kanamycin gene into the genomic region where we want to target and then utilized other recombinase to remove the Kanamycin gene.For the red light system, we transformed a plasmid containing the entire red light system (Cph8, HO1 and PcyA), along with a promoter, a terminator and an OmpR regulated reporter.Therefore, when bacteria carrying this gene are provided with the red light, the reporter cannot be synthesized.The result supported this prediction because we can observe a distinctive expression pattern between the treated (provided with red light) and untreated (kept in dark) group.Eventually, we successfully fused two proteins with the seamless cloning, as is supported by the appearance of 4-5kb bands in nearly all lanes.In addition, we added a roughly 36bp linker between the two in order to increase its flexibility.As can be seen in Figure 3, roughly 1kb bands appear nearly in every lane, supporting that our knock-out system was effective.In this experiment, we planned to fuse two proteins, a recombinase and a Cas9, together.(c) Measure OD600 value of each dilution of the suspension, using liquid LB as blank.", "safety": "Before we started our project, all of our team members had received lab safety training, including standard experimental protocols, disposal of waste, information on hazardous chemicals and proper use of biosafety cabinets etc.The risks to team members were minimized by wearing appropriate PPEs in the lab all the time and following lab safety regulations of Tsinghua University.In order to avoid that problem, all members in the team were instructed of how to distribute and utilize this gene with specific orientation.Since that ccdB is an inhibitor of DNA gyrase and therefore interferes with normal bacterial activity, any improper disposal of ccdB protein and plasmids containing ccdB gene will pose serious results to the natural bacterial communities.In addition, since that ccdB is not harmful for human beings, it is trustworthy and safe to use this protein to kill the bacteria.In one of our experimental design, a lethal protein ccdB was used to screen for successful dCas9-recombinase hybrid design.Therefore, it\u0092s reasonable to conclude that our hardware is harmless.The E. coli we involved in the whole project was lab safe strain DH5?.", "keywords": "chromoprotein encouraged references respiration

contained within any one current manufacturing method today.Table 1: Summary of values of precursors, intermediates, and aldehydes that will be investigated.The soil microbe Pseudomonas putida is known to break down multiple toluene derivatives through a well-characterized metabolism [5].Further investigation of BADH with corresponding alcohol intermediates for these substrates is described below.Figure 7: Successful production of corresponding alcohols and aldehydes for toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene.Figure 8: Extent of conversion of toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene to either alcohol or aldehyde.As shown in Figure 8, XO was not shown to be active as expected from literature [7] for 3-chlorotoluene, m-anisaldehyde, and p-anisaldehyde.The Pu promoter of P. putida is activated in response to the presence of toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene when the activator protein xylR is also present in conjunction with IHF and RNAP \u00cf\u008354 (both of which are naturally found in E. coli) [16].Xylene monooxygenase is one of many oxygenases reported in literature to have the activity described below, and produces indigo at a significant titer.Along with its oxygenase activity on methyl groups, XO can act on naturally generated indole from E. coli and synthesize indigo dye with the mechanism shown below in Figure 14.Figure 13: Aldehyde production from alcohol substrates  Though it was not shown that P. putida BADH was able to produce p-anisaldehyde, the iGEM team was still able to identify two previously unknown activates of the enzyme.One of the largest byproducts of this industry is a mixture of toluene and its derivatives, and as a result roughly 21 million tons of toluene alone are produced each year [2].We chose the complex chemical mixtures of gasoline and simulated BTX (toluene and the three xylene isomers) to serve as stand-ins, as they would provide complex substrates from which to measure the concentration of our terminal products, benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde.However, it is demonstrated in Figure 22 below that in the simulated BTX mixture benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol are both generated from toluene.The genes XylA, XylM, and XylB from the P. putida TOL pathway were successfully integrated into E. coli to form a system for bioremediation of and manufacturing using toluene derivatives.E. coli Platform: A Novel Approach for Synthesis of Aromatic Aldehydes  Our group engineered the genes xylA, xylB, and xylM into Escherichia coli, and the modified organism now functions as the biocatalyst for aromatic aldehyde synthesis.BBa_K1966001 contains xylB, the P. putida benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (BADH).Though BADH has been previously demonstrated to be functional with benzyl alcohol, 3-methylbenzyl alcohol, and 4-methylbenzyl alcohol [5], it has not been tested with the alcohol products that were originally expected from XO: 3-chlorobenzyl alcohol, 3-methoxybenzyl alcohol, and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol.E. coli was selected as an expression host because it is a well understood model organism, and it has been previously indicated in literature that aspects of our platform are functional in this host [7].The constructs listed below were all submitted by the UKT iGEM team for this year s project.Industrial aromatic aldehyde synthesis takes advantage of the low price and high availability of toluene derivatives as a substrate for production.The chromatogram in Figure 22 shows only toluene, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde as o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene cannot be reasonably differentiated with available GC-MS methods, so chromatograms for these compounds would be inconclusive.BADH s activity on substrates with both halogen and methoxy functional groups shows that it is a reasonably wide substrate-range enzyme and is a suitable choice for generation of a library of aromatic aldehydes from aromatic alcohols.The final aspect of our product is indigo production.Although little benzaldehyde was produced, a significant amount of toluene was converted to the more environmentally friendly benzyl alcohol.It is likely that at a higher gasoline concentration more benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde would be detected, but because toluene was only present at approximately 0.25%v/v in the culture substrate availability is limited.It has been previously explained in literature that though xylene monooxygenase can act on these substrates [7] it does so with far lower specificity than to its primary targets (toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene).Toluene s corresponding aldehyde product benzaldehyde is used as the most common source of almond flavoring and fragrance across the globe, and is therefore much more valuable than toluene.This compound was chosen more to show novel functions of P. putida BADH than for its practical application; this is the first ever demonstration that the enzyme acts upon halogenated toluene derivatives.Figure 18: Regulation of the P. putida Pu promoter.Figure 19: Constructed and proposed constructs for Pu promoter-regulated expression.When constructed as in part BBa_K196600x and grown with IPTG to induce the lac promoter, the Pu promoter is intended to sense and respond to toluene derivative substrates in media and subsequently express genes for their remediation.Because XO is sterically prevented from acting upon toluene derivatives with functional groups in the ortho position, we have only investigated m-xylene and p-xylene here.We hypothesize that the BADH promotes the conversion of indoxyl to 3-indoxole, which is necessary to produce indigo (Figure 14).In order to confirm that indigo was the compound synthesized, samples of extracted indigo in chloroform were kept and a UV-Vis spectra was checked for each (Figure 15).Spectra results indicated that indigo is in fact the compound produced.Figure 15: The spectrum on the left is the expected spectra for indigo (15, UTA chem), and spectra on the right apply to equal volume cultures grown with and without BADH as labeled.It has been demonstrated that multiple derivatives can undergo successful uptake and metabolism by P. putida and that derivatives with other groups such as halogens or carbonyls can be altered by the xylene monooxygenase [6], [7].BBa_K1966000 contains xylA and xylM, the two subunits of P. putida xylene monooxygenase (XO).This dehydrogenase is active on a wide range of aromatic alcohols, and given that indoxyl is an aromatic alcohol it likely is a substrate that BADH has specificity towards.In cases where the alcohol intermediate is more valuable than the aldehyde (notably 3-methylanisole and 3-chlorotoluene), that chemical can be produced using inly the XO module (part BBa_K1966000) instead of the composite part (BBa_K1966003) we have submitted, which will be discussed in further detail.Only the XO module has been shown in literature to function with both of these substrates, making us the first group to observe the BADH function for each.It is produced at such a large scale and in such excess worldwide that it is the cheapest of all components of BTX (Table 1).Toluene in a culture with mixed xylenes was successfully converted to benzyl alcohol and aldehyde which simulated a BTX waste stream bioremediation scenario.A simulated BTX was generated by adding a mixture of o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, and toluene at 1.25 mM each to cultures for a total of 5 mM BTX mixture.All substrates used in our experiments are of low value due to the fact that they are waste products (Table 1), but producing each aldehyde provides an increase in value of up to 25 fold.These are 2 of the 3 novel functions we have found for P. putida BADH.However, production levels with BADH under these conditions showed over 8-fold increase over XO alone; conditions designed for enhanced indigo production was 1.3-fold greater (Figure 17).Given all its potential applications, p-anisaldehyde is nearly 25 times more valuable than the respective substrate (Table 1).Toluene is the main component of BTX waste.These enzymes are both limited by an inability to act on compounds with groups in the ortho position, but other similar enzymes exist in hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria that are active for such substrates (these are similarly not active for groups in the meta and para positions).Aromatic aldehydes have a wide range of industrial uses, most prominently in the flavor and fragrance industry.Toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene were converted to their respective alcohols and aldehydes using high cell density cultures.P. putida xylene monooxygenase (XO) has been shown in literature to have a wide substrate range specificity, including all 6 substrates above (8, wide range substrate paper).Indigo dye was produced both in toluene derivative cultures, and in cultures with added indole.With this in mind, our project s goal is to construct a safe and renewable platform for synthesis of aromatic aldehydes from a cheap toluene derivative feedstock.As shown in Figure 8, toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene were all remediated at high rates.Showcasing our organism s ability to function under real-world conditions will allow for optimization of the strain and its potential application to degrading waste streams such as gasoline run-off and the production of valuable chemical intermediates.This substrate has previously been demonstrated at length, as it is the main target of the P. putida TOL pathway.Instead of the composite part BBa_K196003, part BBa_K196000 (containing only the XO module) can be used to produce the alcohol instead.P. putida uses a xylene monooxygenase consisting of two subunits, xylA and xylM, to oxidize a methyl substituent on a derivative to an alcohol group.Our platform was successful in converting the majority of toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene to their respective aldehyde products.One of the significant goals of this project is to characterize BADH for new functionality on these chemicals.Our parts are successful in converting toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene into their respective alcohols and aldehydes.Indigo production was increased when the host contained XylB.Primary Structure of Xylene Monooxygenase: Similarities to and Differences from the Alkane Hydroxylation System.Due to the fact that characterization was carried out under limited oxygen conditions to combat evaporation, we hypothesize that the combination of limited oxygen availability and low enzyme substrate specificity inhibited significant production of the desired products.Figure 21: Conversion of toluene to benzyl alcohol and trace amounts of benzaldehyde in 0.5% v/v gasoline.Another unexpected result related to indigo production was that the presence of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (BADH, BBa_K1966001) increases indigo production.Although this makes good use of the toxic precursors, the industrial processes used today present their own set of challenges, primarily that the most common catalysts are known environmental hazards themselves [4].Our part BBa_K1966004 contains all the necessary parts for regulation of the Pu promoter in E. coli.These conditions are only intended for indigo synthesis and not aromatic aldehyde or alcohol generation.The UTK iGEM team is continuing to troubleshoot the construct and registry information for the part will be updated if it is shown to be functional.Toluene from gasoline was successfully converted to benzyl alcohol which simulated a bioremediation scenario.2)Indigo extracted from cultures of BL21 DE3+XO+BADH (F) and BL21 DE3+XO (E).Part BBa_K1966003 is a composite part built from BBa_K196600 and BBa_K1966001 via digestion/ligation in the Biobrick cloning platform.In addition to the main advantage of bioremediation, this platform provides another benefit in its economic value.Characterization on 3-methyl anisole, 4-methyl anisole, and 3-chlorotoluene was attempted but unsuccessful (Figure 8).Alcohols on 5-membered aromatic rings have been shown in literature as functional substrates for XO but not with BADH.p-anisaldehyde also finds uses as a flavor and fragrance additive, which, when used either alone or with other chemicals, can create a taste or scent of flowers, aniseed, fennel, and licorice.It was not functional for 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (Figure 12).The corresponding aldehydes for the 3 and 4-methyl compounds are m and p-anisaldehyde, respectively.The most important aspect of this synthesis is that no group other than a methyl group located at the 1-prime carbon will be affected.Extractions from XO+BADH vs. XO-only are visibly more colorful, and pelleted cells are far darker (Figure 16).Figure 16: 1) Pelleted cultures of BL21 DE3+XO (A-B) vs pelleted cultures of BL21 DE3+XO+BADH (C-D).Kunz, D. and Chapman, P. Catabolism of Pseudocumene and 3-Ethyltoluene by Pseudomonas putida mt-2: Evidence for New Functions of the TOL Plasmid.Characterization of Five Genes in the Upper-Pathway Operon of TOL Plasmid pWW0 from Pseudomonas putida and Identification of Gene Products.This means that any groups at the meta or para positions of the ring remain untouched by the pathway, allowing for the generation of a robust library of aromatics.m-anisaldehyde and p-anisaldehyde have the most diverse range of applications of our target products.Part BBa_K1996004 is designed to express RFP under the same conditions.In order to prove functionality of the Pu promoter, the team first characterized its responsiveness in RFU via RFP expression levels in BBa_K1966004.The spectra above (Figure 15) also shows a significantly greater amount of indigo was present in cultures with BADH expressed.Conversion of both xylenes to their respective aromatic aldehydes generates a more valuable, more useful, and less toxic molecule.This allows us to synthesize alcohols, aldehydes, and indigo crystals all at once with the same method, yielding over 2 g/L indigo while simultaneously achieving our main project goals.It should be noted that indigo production could compete for enzyme activity and limit productivity of aldehydes and alcohols, but we do not have a method at this time of preventing competition given that indigo production will occur any time the enzymes are active and indole is present.Figure 22: Conversion of toluene in simulated BTX mixture.We used two scenarios to show real-world applications of our remediation platform: remediation of gasoline and a simulated BTX mixture.Following this, the native benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (xylB) reduces the alcohol group to an aldehyde, generating an aromatic aldehyde.Confirmed sequences of these parts are available in the registry.The concentration of gasoline was kept low due to safety concerns in the lab.Figure 12: Activity of BADH on 3 novel substrates.To show the efficacy of our approach to bioremediation, we subjected our organism to complex chemical mixtures that simulate those it would be exposed to in the field as a bioremediator and in industry as a production module.Gasoline, which contains significant amounts of toluene (5-7%, added to improve octane rating [17]), was added to cultures with BL21 DE3+BBa_K1966003 (XO+BADH) at a concentration of 5% v/v.", "design": "", "human_practice": "The UTK iGEM team also addressed human practices by engaging the public and raising awareness of synthetic

conclusion, Nina suggested we should consider applying our technology for something other than therapeutic compounds:\u0093Maybe this would be more applicable for production of other things than therapeutics - such as bulk chemicals, enzymes or food additives, that do not have the same quality and purity requirements.\u0094 Summary of the main points from the Novo Nordisk interview:  Purity and quality of the product along with a stable supply chain and production is the most important aspects when producing therapeutics.But we need to know the consequences.\u0094 was what Gernot J. Abel from the Research and Technology department at Novozymes in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, said, when we asked him, whether Novozymes would consider switching to Y. lipolytica as production organism in case our molecular toolbox is up and running, and then base the production on waste streams such as glycerols, fatty acids and media containing other complex carbohydrates.\u0093The more you can do with one single strain, the better.Klaudia, Mikkel, Nicolai and Isabella learned all about the process of extracting oil from the plants and how a sediment consisting of complex carbohydrates is left over from the production.Implementation of substrates from waste streams in the biotech manufacturing industry The second part of our integrated human practices consisted of interviews and feedback from two of the biggest biotech companies in Denmark, Novo Nordisk A/S and Novozymes A/S, who we asked questions about our idea about using complex waste streams, such as the sediment from canola oil production, in state of the art industrial processes.Novo Nordisk currently produces recombinant insulin in the conventional baker s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by growing it on different refined sugars.We ultimately asked Nina and Kjeld from Novo Nordisk, if they believed changing their insulin production to Yarrowia lipolytica growing on abundant waste streams would be an option:\u0093Well, it would be a huge project!That is where our focus is compared to changing our production host.\u0094Summary of the main points from the Novozymes interview:  Production on waste streams should be cheaper compared to traditional production.Because the product quality is so important, it would be a very long and complicated changeover, which will include a new factory and new experts, so it would have to be a very good business case,\u0094 Nina replied and Kjeld followed:\u0093A stabile, continued supply of substrates is very important.If you can cut production costs 10% down and use different waste streams, then cool!\u0094Novozymes currently base their production on easy accessible proteins and carbohydrates such as sugars and starch and as cheap as possible, but Gernot J. Abel is open to the idea of using waste streams as substrates.Nina Gunnarsson added: \u0093We obviously have a big focus on having the most optimal processes with the highest possible yield with the minimum environmental impact.\u0094And the most optimal process is for Novo Nordisk is one, where the demand for purity is met.Although, since we are just a group of young, blue eyed students coming from the comfort of the university, we learned a lot by investigating how our idea fit into real life settings and exploring the viability of basing industrial biotechnological processes on waste streams.Afterwards we presented our idea to players in the biotech manufacturing companies, and the feedback we recieved from them made us more aware of the challenges our technology is facing and it ultimately led us to a more feasible project.We are more focused on our obligation to provide sufficient amounts of insulin to the patients\u0094said Kjeld Olesen, when we asked them if changing their substrate into a less competitive and sustainable one was something they were considering.Our RD research is important in developing but in the end of the day, you have to deliver to the market and be able to send enzymes and ship them to the customers... For us it\u0092s more important that our enzymes can do their job.We integrated this in our project by investigating the growth characterstics of Y. lipolytica on the sediment and finally settling for it as a proof of concept substrate for the biorefineries of tomorrow.Visit to the local canola oil producer, Gr\u00f8nninggaard.We started investigating one of the classical examples of a waste stream today, glycerol, and came in contact with local biodiesel producers, Perstorp and Emmelev A/S.\"The nutrients are important and it\u0092s important to be flexible and be able to change according to what is available on the market.Talking to the Biodiesel producers, we were suprised to find that they do not percieve glycerol as being a waste, but actually already is a valuable byproduct used in the chemical, pharmaceutical and tobacco industry.\"\"The nutrients are important and it\u0092s important to be flexible and be able to change according to what is available on the market.After realizing this we went back to the drawing board in search of a \"true waste product\", which did not have any competing uses.Insulin is most likely not produced from waste sources anytime soon, although the tools we have developed during this project might actually yield a viable production of bulk products in the not so distant future.Nina and Kjeld explained to us that purity in regards to avoiding degradative proteins and post-translational modification, especially O-glycosylation, is very important, but the purity of the entire process is essential to obtain the high level of quality required for a therapeutic protein.After the interviews with Novo Nordisk and Novozymes, we were even more confident in our project.We investigated their waste streams with the perception that glycerol was an abundant waste product from their productions and thereby a by-product, they would be more than happy to get of their hands.After researching less classical waste streams and talking to even more industry, we got into contact with a local canola oil producer who had a promissing substrate for our project.Cell factories is our heart and our production system, so it\u0092s extremely important.\u0094Like Novo Nordisk, Novozymes have one main goal and that is to deliver, what the customers require both in regards to meeting the demand for quality and quantity.Gernot stated that having a process, where the fermentor is cleanable and the fermentation controllable is essential:\u0093One question is if we can make these cell factories cheaper\u0085 It has to be controlled, it needs to be clean and temperature controllable.Manufacturing is about up-scaling and it\u0092s one of the challenges in synthetic biology.\"Manufacturing is about up-scaling and it\u0092s one of the challenges in synthetic biology.Making Yeastilization viableEngagement and communication with stakeholders and the potential users of our technology has been evident from day one of the project by dialog and interviews with significant players in the industry.However, he also made us aware of some the main points of the Novozymes strategy, which our technology must accommodate in order to be viable.Talking to him we learned a lot about canola oil production and waste handling, and quickly realised that this by-product was ideal for our project.", "modeling": "The assumption is, if we amplify the genes associated to the reactions whose fluxes increase, we can force the product and growth rate to couple.These reactions are introduced into the GSM as below: 3  phytoeneSynthase (crtYB): 2.0 geranylgeranyl diphosphate < --> 2.0 diphosphate + 2.0 H+ + phytoene caroteneDesaturaseStep1 (crtI): phytoene 6.0 H+ + neurosporene caroteneDesturaseStep2 (crtI): neurosporene lycopene + 2.0 H+ lycopeneCyslase (crtYB): lycopene --> beta-carotene + 2.0 H+  To be able to optimize beta-carotene product flux, we must define a sink, or demand reaction in the GSM, this is done by creating a boundary exchange reaction where beta-carotene is, in silico, secreted into extracellular space, this reaction is defined as: DM_bcarotene is then set consequently as objective function when optimizing for production flux.In our case, the linear program was solved in COBRA, which uses a simplex algorithm by default.8 The objective function and constraints were based on the most recent SBML model of Y. lipolytica.5 REFERENCE Further mathematical details are omitted.Using Phenotype Phase Planes to Explore Growth and Production in Different Environments The Phenotype Phase Plane is a great way to explore target flux (e.g.In the next sections, we will tell our story on how we used these algorithms to achieve our goals of exploring Y.lipolytica growth and predicting gene manipulations to achieve better beta-carotene yield.Using FBA to Calculate Steady-State Flux DistributionMost GSM problems are solved using the flux balance analysis (FBA).This is done, by incrementally increasing the beta-carotene production flux from zero towards its theoretical maximum, then under the constraints, optimize growth rate.For the network above, this is equivalent to the following set of constraints:Now, consider the full genome-scale model of Yarrowia lipolytica with (M) = 1683 metabolites and (R) = 1985 reactions.Let (r = (r_1, ... , r_R)) be the vector of the (R) reaction rates, and similarly let (m = (m_1, ... ,m_M)) be the vector of the (M) metabolites.As genes are defined and associated to reactions and metabolites in the GSM, we can simulate gene amplification, inhibition, and KOs, by giving the flux associated with that gene a value larger, smaller, or zero value, respectively.Both play important roles in the subsequent phenotype phase plane analysis.Consider a very simple metabolic network with two metabolites, (A) and (B), where (A) flows into the cell with rate (r_1), is converted into (B) with rate (r_2), which is then excreted from the cell with rate (r_3): Under a steady-state assumption, i.e.In addition to the steady-state constraints on the metabolites, for each reaction rate, (r_j), there is a lower and an upper bound ((l_j) and (u_j)).The reaction of which the rate is to be maximized, for example the biomass function, is then denoted the objective function and can be expressed as, Now, for (m_i), the equality constraint (c_i) can be expressed as a sum of all (r_j) weighted by the stoichiometric coefficients (a_{ij}), where (a_{ij}) = 0 for reactions that do not affect the concentration of the considered metabolite.The GSM has information on what metabolites are in the cell, which reactions each metabolite takes part in, the stoichiometry of the reactions, reactions\u0092 rate limits, reversabilities, charge balances, genes associations etc.In our study, we couple beta-carotene yield to growth rate, and find out what genes should be amplified, inhibited, or knocked out, to achieve this coupling.The simulation results are supported by the substrate screening experiments, adding the value of predicting the effect of substrate uptake rates on growth behaviour.We fulfilled purpose 2: using Flux Scanning based on Enforced Objective Flux (FSEOF) simulations.This kind of dual-variable (C and O2) flux investigation is called Phenotype Phase Plane(PHPP) analysis, it predicts the growth rate (or product fluxes, depending on your goal) in different cultivation environments 2.A genome-scale-model (GSM) is a representation of the metabolic network in a form that computers can understand and use to calculate the fluxes (rates of reactions) of the system.To model the insertion of the beta-carotene pathway, we introduced 2 more genes - crtYB and crtI, and they catalyze 4 new reactions.Using a GSM of Yarrowia Lipolytica (Y.lipolytica), we explored how Y.lipolytica grows on different substrates and found out what genes need to be manipulated to optimize beta-carotene production.Now, define the Lagrangian function:The solution to the linear program is then found by maximizing the gradient of the Lagrangian, (\bigtriangledown mathcal{L}(lambda,c,r)) , while satisfying all constraints, i.e.Explore how Y. lipolytica grows in different environments and identify optimal conditions for growth.Predict what genes can be amplified to enhance beta-carotene yield.We used the most recently published GSM for Y. lipolytica 5 , solved using Cameo 9 and Cobra Matlab.As we increase the enforced production flux, and solve for the other fluxes, some of these fluxes will increase, while other will decrease.Using FSEOF to Identify Gene Amplification and Inhibition Targets to Optimize Yield Any organism will, by its evolutionary nature, maximize growth rate.growth rate or product secretion rate), as a function of two fluxes, in our case, carbon source uptake rate and oxygen uptake rate.These inequality constraints can be expressed as,Having the objective function and the constraints well-stated, the linear program6 can be formulated in standard form:Solving this program is equal to optimizing the genome-scale model.Setting different constraints on the fluxes allow us to define different cultivation environments.So if our team, or another, reinitiates the beta-carotene project, the computational support is already in place to guide the wetlab teams towards more optimal growth environment and strain design.The output is the set of reaction rates for all reactions in the network along with the set of shadow prices associated with the metabolites.This allows us to predict how Y. lipolytica grows using different Carbon(C) sources and different availability of the C source and oxygen.In other words, we want an engineered strain that, in order to maximize its growth rate, it must also produce the desired product.We investigated different Carbon sources as substrates and identified lines of optimality (the optimal relationship between substrate and oxygen uptake rates).FSEOF is a technique to identify what fluxes increase, when beta-carotene flux is enforced to be a certain value.by solving the system,Then, the output will consist of the set ((f(r),r,lambda)), i.e.However, there are regions in the solution space over which the rate of shadow prices are constant.If we change the substrates in the medium to wastes, we can see how much growth behaviour changes.The algorithms include FBA (flux balance analysis) based PHPP(PHenotype Phase Plane), and FSEOF (Flux scanning based on enforced objective flux).It formulates a constraint based optimization problem from the constraints we defined for the GSM.the reaction rates (including the one corresponding to the objective function) and the shadow prices.We can set some fluxes to certain levels to simulate a specific environment, or gene manipulation, allowing us to simulate the Wild-Type\u0092s (WT) and/or Mutant\u0092s growth behaviour in that specific environment.We have algorithms from literatures which help us to perform these simulations.FBA is the groundstone for all the algorithms we used to conduct the GSM.The following explains the mathematical basis for GSM.The results will serve as excellent starting point and guidance for future genetic engineering efforts in the lab.As annotated whole genome sequences become common, It is possible to reconstruct a genome scale representations of the metabolic network as a computational model.These constraints can be modeled in GSM by setting balanced equations and limiting reaction rates (fluxes).In order to accomplish that, it is necessary to define the so-called Lagrangian Function.For each constraint (c_i) on the metabolite (m_i), let (lambda_i) be the associated Lagrange multiplier7 or shadow price, let (lambda = (lambda_i,...,lambda_M)) and let (c = (c_1,...,c_M, c_{M+1}...,c_{M+R})).where all metabolite levels are constant and no metabolite can be accumulated in the system, the formation and degradation rates for each metabolite must cancel each other.Thus,Which is just a generalization of the constraints of the two-metabolite network presented in the previous section.We do this by manipulating its genes, forcing product yield and growth rate to go hand-in-hand.The beta-carotene project was later shelved, due to problems with the biobricks and cloning.", "notebook": "More

were accumulated and discussed in the weekly team meeting, at which our two instructors Andreas and Volker (both PhD students at the lab of Prof. Skerra) were present to reflect on our project.Here we enumerate the specific tasks as well as the student(s) who performed them in order to allow the judges to directly contact the student responsible for a topic of interest.As we produced, purified, conjugated, and analyzed many different protein samples, several team members were involved, including Niklas, Jan and Julian.As he spent the last years in Boston at the MIT and at Harvard, he is very open-minded concerning the potential and possible applications of SynBio in the future.In the course of our project, we have met many nice people willing to help and support us with lab space, knowledge, or materials.Wanting to share the project she (and the GRK) looked for a lab participating in the graduate center that could host the iGEM team as main lab.He generously offered all of the resources available at his chair together with the excellent analytical equipment, while letting us free rein to plan and execute the project on our own \u0096 and we are very grateful that he provided us with this opportunity!Prof.Prof. Dr. Skerra (our main PI, TUM) already filled the role of the main PI of TUM s 2012 and 2013 iGEM teams and thus had the first-hand experience of what it means to host an iGEM team.He joined our weekly team meeting once after we had decided on our project, giving us several invaluable tips concerning what components to integrate and what aspects to focus on in order to arrive at a proof of principle in the end.Shaker flask productions were conducted independently of other lab members; for fermentation (which turned out to be a somewhat more difficult than explained in lectures), one of our instuctors had an eye on the whole production.Purification with normal columns was performed independently; for those involving the \u00c4kta purifier, a lab member supervised our handling for the first 3 to 5 chromatographies.In the first week, we received an introduction to molecular cloning.He supervised Hallie, an exchange student from the USA who joined our team to create this survey and elucidate how we can make iGEM more productive concerning its output in successful start-up companies.The Wiki was programmed by Peter, a student in Media Informatics (LMU).As an experienced christallographer he was able to create a PAS(200) sequence with lysines that could be used later on for the creation of the PAS animation.We thank Professor Dr. Schnieke and her of Livestock Biotechnology at the WZW (TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan) for so generously providing us with the opportunity to use the micromanipulator at the chair s laboratory and allowing us to conduct several highly specific experiments with our bioink.With the extensive help and instructions of Dr. Nicolas Ortega, a researcher at the lab having much experience with the device, we were able to plan experiments and test our bioprinting technique on a minuscule scale.Below you can find all the stations we stopped by throughout our journey up to the outcome of our project.All work associated with planning, conducting, and evaluating experiments was performed by student members of our team.The hypoxia experiments were performed by Jan and Elena, who were ready to take samples every 12 hours.The flow cytometry experiments were all performed by Luisa as she spent 18 months in a research group in Hamburg before she started her studies in Munich, thus already versed in all skills necessary to measure our cells in FACS.Fluorescence microscopy at the lab of Prof. Skerra was performed by different people as it was necessary for many different sub-projects.Dr. Westmeyer (secondary PI, TUM, Helmholtz center) was asked to join the team halfway through the project when we realized that we required his expertise in the field of fluorescence microscopic imaging.High-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy was conducted at the Helmholtz Center in Munich in the lab of Prof. Westmeyer by Christoph as he will also do his master s thesis in this lab.Samples were prepared by student members of the team, the actual measurement was performed by a technical assistant (which is also true for PhD students).To further characterize the expression of the different receptor constructs our team wanted to take a closer look at the respective mRNA levels.We also want to thank one of his PhD students, Dominik Buschmann, for helping us with the experiments and the analysis of the gathered data.The hypoxia experiments could only be performed thanks to the support of the Schwille Group at the Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried, which kindly provided the required incubation facility.In the end, however, we agreed that the next years of iGEM will most likely witness the establishment of a separate bioprinting track and that this topic has extraordinary potential.5.11 Chemical synthesis of Biotin-NHS active estersAttributions are an important point of any iGEM project as it is necessary to put the results obtained by the team into the context of individual responsibilities.The initial motivation to found this year s iGEM team was sparked by the Graduate Center GRK 2062: Molecular principles of synthetic biology, which desired to re-establish the iGEM competition in Munich.Thus, each of these years saw students wanting to participate in the iGEM competition but facing the bleak perspective that there was no hosting lab that offered the support necessary to make the \"iGEM experience\".Thus, we will attempt to candidly describe how our project evolved, which student was responsible for which sub-project, and who supported our project with scientific or non-scientific contributions.For the story of finding our project, it is essential to know that there was no iGEM team from either TUM or LMU in 2015 and no team at TUM in 2014.For this reason, he is quite busy and unable invest great amounts of time in the iGEM competition.He received the introduction into staining cells and performing confocal imaging experiments from our external Instructor Jeff.Our colorful Scanning Electron Microscopy images were shot by Prof. Dr. Wanner from the Plant Science Department of the Ludwig-Maximilians University.We are sincerely grateful for his support!For our \"linker chemistry\" subproject, we needed fresh blood samples as a readily available source of human biotinidase in the form of plasma.For this purpose, Vivien, the student who performed the chemical experiments, utilized her own blood graciously drawn by PD Dr. med.Likewise, the idea for our bioprinting project is far older than just this year \u0096 at least in theory.At this point, our last doubts melted, and we were wholly confident that our project choice was just right.As implied above, it was very difficult to convince a professor at TUM of an iGEM participation, and at LMU as well it was cumbersome to find a PI enthusiastic about iGEM now that Prof. Mascher has left Munich.Thomas Skurk, a medical doctor at the Institute for Food & Health.Chemical synthesis was performed by Vivien, as she wrote her bachelor s thesis at the Chair of Organic Chemistry at TUM.If you are interested in the video, please ask her, as she really did it on her own\u00a0;)As there was no PDB file available from the PAS-polypeptide we asked the Junior-PI Dr. Andre Schiefner at the Chair of Biological Chemistry (TUM) for help.As he also works in web design and completed his bachelor s thesis in parallel, he was quite busy and did not have overly much time (which is why we finalized our CSS on the last evening).Prof. Dr. Jung (one of our secondary PIs, LMU) is the head of this graduate center and thus impulsed the creation of a team by recruiting students.The initial synthesis plan was discussed with Dr. Martin Dauner, who is the chemist in the lab of Prof. Skerra.In order to do so we asked Professor Dr. Pfaffl for help, since he is one of the leading experts for quantitative PCR.Apart from this session with him, it is his philosophy that iGEM is a student s competition and that the students themselves should design and create the project.In the process, our team members Julian and Javier were able to observe the ejection process under controlled conditions in great detail and document the behavior of our modified HEK cells containing ink.Vivien evaluated all results (including NMR).To be honest, we are very proud that the Maya Video Vivien built looks so great in the end.He supported us, especially in the final weeks, with cell-biological reagents for staining and transfection as well as with the analytical instrumentation of his lab.Instructors assisted the students in planning their experiments, introducing relevant molecular-biological and chemical techniques to the students when they performed a specific experiment for the first time.By the way, it was much encouraging to listen to Randy in Paris when he described the potential of SynBio and chose bioprinting of organs for an example!Moreover, the students evaluated the experiments themselves after an introduction to the theory and advice on what to do and what to avoid.Initial renderings that she showed to the team were far more simple than the final product.", "background": "", "description": "In using a two-component system of genetically engineered cells and proteins, we create a \"molecular superglue\" that allows precise positioning of cells via bioprinting and locking them in position, allowing the formation of three-dimensional intercellular contacts and physiological microenvironments.Figure 2: Our modified 3D-printer to printing genetically engineered cells, enabling the creation of stable cellular matrices.For cell delivery, we hijacked a conventional 3D printer that can be programmed to inject cells with sub-millimeter precision.Therefore, by providing a tool to render research on a supercellular scale more accessible, we are convinced that our system is able to noticeably advance science in many areas.In addition to establishing the biotINK system itself, we have also worked on several ways to functionalize tissue: To create synthetic organs, we modified cells to secrete insulin in response to external stimuli with infrared light.bio(t)INK - a synthetic biology approach to bioprintingWhile interactions between biomolecules make up cellular systems, the three-dimensional organization of cells makes up tissues and organs.But that s not all: The printing system we created can easily reproduced by any lab around the world provided they have a conventional 3D printer to start with, allowing to print cellular structures as required with only little initial investment.[3]Our ambitious project intends to eliminate these disadvantages: We are able to create three-dimensional cellular structures easily, quickly and at low cost by immediately cross-linking cells into a protein/cell-matrix upon printing.[2]Figure 1: A vision of bioprinting in the future: designing and printing whole organs in the lab.So far, Bioprinting systems have not been able to distinctly impact either of these fields.While much on the molecular interactions within cells is known, comparatively little is known about the complex interactions of cells with each other.For decades, scientists have tried to reconstitute such functional tissues by assembling the cells they are made of \u0096 especially for the field of regenerative medicine, where acquiring \u0096 or failing to acquire \u0096 suitable transplants may mean life or death for the patient.[1]Thus, not only could bioprinting prove fruitful in the field of personalized medicine \u0096 for pharmacological applications, three-dimensional cell culture systems often constitute the first step in testing a potential pharmacological agent.The technical complexity of the printing process itself makes bioprinting, as it exists now, not only cumbersome but also time-consuming and expensive.Furthermore, the growth of two-dimensional cellular layers does not resemble histogenesis in vivo and is limited to simple tissues that do not require exact positioning or contain multiple cell types.The interactions of cells with each other and the protein matrix are mediated by the strongest non-covalent force found in nature \u0096 the biotin-streptavidin interaction.After a certain timespan of in vitro maturation, cells form intercellular contacts and start to grow into two-dimensional cell layers.Apart from the more medically oriented aspects of regenerative medicine and pharmacology, cellular systems are also of great interest for basic and applied research.Furthermore, we have also modified our system to work in bacterial cells.? Murphy, S. V., & Atala, A.", "design": "[1] For our project, signal peptides constituted a crucial part of many constructs, used to target transmembrane proteins to the cell surface (receptors) and proteins to the ER (BirA), and to secrete proteins into the surrounding medium (luciferase assays to quantify expression levels).Figure 2: Cotranslational translocation of a membrane protein into the ER in a schematic depiction showing the nascent, unfolded peptide chain containing signal peptide (start-transfer sequence) and stop-transfer sequence as well as the ER membrane.Two different variants were used: enhanced monomeric avidin, a single-subunit avidin that is nevertheless able to bind biotin, and single-chain avidin, which resembles the naturally occurring avidin tetramer but consisting of a single polypeptide chain.All receptors mediate the same function: By interacting with streptavidin in the printing reservoir \u0096 either directly by presenting biotin (biotin acceptor peptide) or indirectly via binding to a biotinylated linker (single-chain avidin variants), cells are cross-linked due to polyvalent binding of streptavidin molecules in the printing solution to several cellular biotin groups at once.The incredible journey: signal peptides and protein targetingEssential to a protein s function are not only its activity or binding properties, but also its presence at the right time in the right place \u0096 the latter in our case being the cell surface.Downstream of this repressor generator we designed and fused a BioBrick (BBa_K2170141) that encodes a double Tet-Operator (Tet-Repressor binding site together with a bacterial promoter and an signal peptide of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA[11]) from E. coli that has a 3  RFC[25] restriction site, allowing the protein fusion of proteins that are secreted into the bacterial periplasm when expressed with this BioBrick.the position occupied by the RFC10 cloning scar.Since both the distance from the promoter to the open reading frame and the Kozak consensus sequence are considered crucial parameters for expression levels[6], BM40 and Ig? signal peptide constructs are likely to result in increased expression levels compared to proteins containing the EGFR signal peptide from the parts registry.In order to predict whether our designed signal peptides would be functional, we used the SignalP server, which allows to make theoretical predictions about signal peptide functionality and cleavage.For Ig? and BM40 signal peptide constructs, a T7 promoter spacer as well as a Kozak sequence increase the distance between TATA box and protein-coding region.Apart from the functional parts that mediate the (strept)avidin-biotin interaction, other elements in the receptor were designed to make sure it is optimally translocated to the membrane, as stable as possible, and easily detectable.[4]During this project, three different signal peptide constructs were tested in order to determine that resulting in the highest expression levels: The EGFR signal peptide was taken from the iGEM parts registry (BBa_K157001) and combined with a BioBrick containing the CMV promoter sequence (BBa_K747096) via the RFC10 cloning standard.B) Schematic representation of a receptor presenting an extracellular single-chain avidin that is endogenously biotinylated by a coexpressed biotin ligase (BirA) and thus presents biotin groups at the cell surface.For this purpose, we built two kinds of receptor constructs, both on their own able \u0096 when expressed in mammalian cells \u0096 to cross-link cells for our approach of bioprinting:1) A receptor presenting an extracellular biotin acceptor peptide that is endogenously biotinylated by a coexpressed biotin ligase (BirA), thus presenting biotin molecules on the cellular surface and allowing it to interact with streptavidin in the printing solution.2) Receptors presenting an extracellular monomeric or single-chain avidin variant.In presenting avidin on the cell surface, cells are able to interact with a co-injected biotinylated linker peptide.C) Schematic depiction of the C-terminal stop-transfer sequence of the receptor.In order to confirm the correct expression and localization of the receptor, the receptor contains three functional elements for its detection for both the N- and the C-terminal receptor domains:  The intracellularly located C-terminal red fluorescent protein mRuby 3 for detection of the receptor via fluorescence microscopy while also providing a stable, folded domain at the C-terminus, an extracellular epitope domain near the N-terminus for immunochemical detection via A3C5-antibody fragments as well as FACS, and  an intracellular Strep-tag II at the N-terminus for the detection and purification via immunochemical methods.Further elements that were included into the expression construct are the CMV promoter for overall high expression levels of the receptor, resulting in a high-avidity-interaction.The BM40 and Ig? signal peptides were designed by us and synthesized with regard to adding additional spacing and functional elements to the 5 -UTR of the constructs, and combined with a BioBrick containing the CMV promoter sequence (BBa_K747096) via the RFC10 cloning standard.With this linker connected to several cell surface avidins as well as streptavidin in the printing solution, a protein matrix is created that embeds cells and allows precise positioning of cells in a three-dimensional manner.Our chosen avidin derivates by design allow functional fusion of the otherwise tetrameric avidin molecule with our receptor.Due to the bacterial signal peptide, the protein is secreted into the bacterial periplasm (the space between the two bacterial membranes of gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli).As a protein fusion, we then assembled a protein cargo domain that is generally exchangeable for any protein that is so small in size that it can be transported through the outer membrane by the EspP autotransporter.The addition of a stop-transfer sequence as in the naturally occurring EGFR sequence, as well as the addition of flexible linkers, makes our EGFR-TMD an improvement over the BioBrick BBa_K157002, which does not possess either of these elements.Figure 4: A) Multiple sequence alignment of human EGFR (see UniProt P00533), the EGFR transmembrane domain BioBrick from the registry (BBa_K157002 and the extended EGFR transmembrane designed by us, containing a charged stop-transfer domain as well as linker elements at the C- and N-termini.The combination of the CMV promoter with the synthesized BM40 and Ig? signal peptides allows for a considerably longer 5\u0092-UTR \u0096 and can thus be made to contain a full Kozak consensus sequence by design.For this purpose, we designed an autotransporter device that is able to present biotinylated or biotin-binding protein domains on the surface of E. coli.Proteins containing a signal peptide include transmembrane proteins, secreted proteins, proteins of the ER itself, proteins of the Golgi apparatus and several more.Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP autotransporter from E. coli[13][14] which is then followed by a bacterial terminator.Our design features an A3C5-epitope tag further downstream that can be recognized by a high-affinity Fab-fragment and is generally used to detect and quantify the surface display of the cargo domain[12].In the following, we explore the contemplations that contributed to the design of the membrane proteins (also referred to as  receptors ) that allow us to embed eukaryotic and bacterial cells into a stable, three-dimensional and user-definable matrix immediately upon printing.The EGFR signal peptide taken from the parts registry is constructed such that the signal peptide ORF immediately follows the RFC10 cloning scar after the CMV promoter, thus resulting in a very short 5\u0092 untranslated region (UTR) of transcribed mRNA.We are sure that this BioBrick will be a valuable contribution to the Parts Registry as it allows future teams to display small protein domains on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli.?

A.For anchoring in the membrane, a type I membrane protein with defined localization of N- and C-terminus out- and inside of the cell was used.After the integration into the outer membrane, the protein cargo is transported through the beta-barrel of the autotransporter and is presented on the bacterial surface.One ubiquitous element for protein targeting is the signal peptide, which enables translocation of proteins to the ER, from where their journey continues to their place of function.Constructs for bacterial surface display are hereby already well known in the field of protein engineering of therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies.A stop-transfer sequence consisting of charged amino acids - being characteristic for type I membrane proteins - was added at the C-terminus, and the sequence was furthermore flanked by a (GGGGC)2-linker at the N- and C-terminus, respectively.[2]The hydrophobic signal peptide (also called start-transfer sequence) usually consists of less than 30 amino acids [3] and is recognized by the signal recognition particle upon translation at the rough ER, mediating cotranslational translocation of the nascent peptide chain into the ER.High-throughput sorting of an Anticalin library via EspP-mediated functional display on the Escherichia coli cell surface.High-throughput sorting of an Anticalin library via EspP-mediated functional display on the Escherichia coli cell surface.The Kozak sequence is recognized by the ribosome as a translational start site; if this element is missing or deviates from the consensus sequence, this may considerably decrease translation efficiency.[7]Figure 3: A) Schematic depiction of a protein-coding mRNA containing a 5 - and 3 -UTR, the first of which is an important factor in translation efficiency.C) ClustalW multiple sequence alignment of the BM40, EGFR and Ig? signal peptide construct, depicting a gap for the EGFR signal peptide construct compared to the newly designed ones and thus indicating a shorter length of the 5 -UTR .For the termination we chose again a well-working terminator from the distribution plate (\"double terminator\"; BBa_B0010-BBa_B0012).2.1 The incredible journey: signal peptides and protein targeting3 Design of an autotransporter construct for bacterial surface displayThink before you ink may be a popular slogan wielded by tattoo adversaries, but it has also been perfectly applicable to creating our synthetic biology approach of bioprinting.If the protein expression of the autotransporter is induced using aTc the autotransporter is transcribed and translated.We based our design on the autotransporter EspP[9].The autotransporter system itself is established and functional (see Fig.At the 3 -end, the construct contains the polyadenylation signal of human growth hormone (hGH) for functional polyadenylation of the transcribed mRNA.As soon as the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added to the culture, it binds to the Tet-repressor that can t bind anymore to the Tet-operator and thus the expression of the autotransporter can be regulated.B) Transmembrane domain prediction by the TMHMM 2.0 server, indicating positioning of N- and C-termini out- and inside of the cell, respectively, as well as predicting functionality of transmembrane regions.\"TetR repressed GFP\"; BBa_K577893) that are available in the parts registry, but when we saw that two of the available systems did not work in our own hands, we decided to built the system on our own.The construct constantly produces Tet-repressor that binds to the Tet-Operator and repressed the promoter activity of the autotransporter gene.When present in the bacteria periplasm the autotransporter diffused to the outer membrane and inserts into the membrane.The N-terminal transmembrane ?-helix of human EGFR (UniProt P00533, amino acids 622-653) was herefore chosen (see below the topology prediction of EGFR via the TMHMM 2.0 server for the prediction of transmembrane helices[8]).Plotted probabilities represent the raw cleavage site \u0093C-score\u0094, the signal peptide \u0093S-score\u0094 and the combined cleavage site \u0093Y-score\u0094.[5] For the EGFR signal peptide construct, a Kozak sequence is not present, as it would have to precede the start codon ATG, i.e.Stable expression of the Golgi form and secretory variants of human fucosyltransferase III from BHK-21 cells Purification and characterization of an engineered truncated form from the culture medium.Journal of molecular biology, 400(4), 783-802.? Binder, U., Matschiner, G., Theobald, I., & Skerra, A.", "human_practice": "Be assured that your new kidney is growing and there won\u0092t be any rejection reaction at all since the kidney is printed for you individually.\u0094On his way out, Dr. M\u00fcller chokes back his tears, remembering all the patients he saw dying while they were waiting for donor organs before SynBio provided him and his colleagues with the live-saving new technology of organ printing.In situations like these, it is possible to find a donor for Luke.From this imput we came to the idea that it would be a great point for our bioprinting approach if we could dissolve the synthetic tissues upon addition of a substance.The situation in Germany is especially pressing since only very few people are organ donors which results in a huge shortage of available organs.Of course we hope to reduce or even solve this problem with our organ printing technology in the future.In an emergency case in which a doctor decides that the synthetic tissue needs to be removed from the patient he gives the patient a single pill with the prodrug (which is Famciclovir in our case) and all transgenic cells in the patient will suffer from a reduced viability and die in only a few days.The second point we identified from our interviews with experts to be crucial was the printed extracellular matrix composed of recombinant proteins.Her, sitting in the hospital every second day for dialysis while waiting for a suitable donor organ and taking medication for the rest of her life.Again, she hears the calm voice of her father, \u0093Modern medicine is unbelievable.However, this depends on finding the right donor with similar biological make-up to Luke, as well as a lot of luck that the transplant will be successful.Today, there is a new possibility.But the worst thing is that your kidney is irreparably damaged,\u0094 Chris\u0092 father discloses the terrible news.Immediately, Chris has a horror scenario in her head.Suddenly, she feels a soft, warm touch on her right hand and the trembling voice of her mother:\u0093Oh darling, I\u0092m so happy that you\u0092re finally awake.\u0094 Chris tries to answer but she can only mumble something incomprehensible.\u0093Don\u0092t worry,\u0094 her dad, sitting on the other side of the bed, replies, \u0093you will soon get well again.However, the interviews also sharpened the responsibility that we perceive when dealing with our new method.medical doctors strengthened our sense for the urgency of organ printing even more and we are more convinced than ever before that a successful implementation of the technology could save thousands of lives every year.In our Linker Chemistry subproject we then developed extended linkers that were expected to be easier or harder to cleave by the biotinidase.In fact the real world impact that our technology might have in the future is one of the major reasons that motivated us every day during the last few months.This approach was successful and we found two additional linkers that are easily accessible by means of organic synthesis and the biotin-valin-NHS linker proved to be much more resistant towards biotinidase cleavage.We did our best to combine a healthy optimism that is needed to do cutting-edge science with a responsible communication to vulnerable stakeholders.The kill-switch was implemented into our project as we were asked several times in discussions with experts (such as medical doctors or life science professors) what would happen if we would have some malignant cells in our printed organs.The prodrug-convertase expressed in the printed organ is generally not harmful as long as no problems for the patient occur.\u0093A car hit you when you were out on your bike.\u0094Her mother interrupts him: \u0093Luckily the following car saw you lying at the side of the road and called the ambulance.\u0094\u0093I don\u0092t know how many of your bones are broken.With any luck, 3D organ printing can provide a full and healthy life to Luke and other people in need of organ transplants.A donor organ not only helps the patient but is a relief also for family and friendsHow these tech-moral scenarios influenced our projectDuring the project we often discussed the new possibilities that successful organ printing would have.Some of the experts worried about immunogenicity of these components especially if it was somehow mentioned in the discussion that in the future it could be an aim for the bioprinting sector to print replacement organs.After her eyes gradually adjust to the brightness, she recognizes that she is in a hospital.As it cleaves-off biotin molecules from proteins in the blood it is also capable of dissolving our bioprinted tissue as soon as it is added to the petri dish with the synthetic tissue.With 3D printing, Luke could have a new, healthy liver printed from his very own DNA,\u00a0highly reducing risk and improving his chance of complete recovery.Suddenly, there is a thread of hope for Luke s parents and their newborn son.As this case is potentially possible and may also be a factor patients or healthcare officials would probably be sensitized, we started to plan a kill switch.After the emergency operation, the doctor came in and took a DNA sample.Patients on a waiting list for a donor organ are in an extremely stressed situation.She opens her eyes and is blinded by the white bed and the bright wall paint.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "Since herpes simplex virus TK is able to phosphorylate guanosine analogues, it has been widely tested as a successful suicide gene in combination with ganciclovir, especially for the treatment of cancers and various virus infections, but also as a kill-switch in various iGEM-projects [7].Therefore, we recommend for in vitro studies to use either ganciclovir or penciclovir, the latter known to be less effective in vitro at least on rat Sertoli cells [21].All strains and lines organisms and cells used were specifically designed for lab applications and are therefore not able to survive outside laboratory conditions as no aspect of our project work overrides these restraints.Biosecurity: No potential misuse or dual-use character in our projectIn order to fully ensure that a project does not allow for any harm to be dealt it is also imperative for the scientists to assess possible harmful misuse of an invention.3 Biosafety: No danger to scientists, the population or the environment4 Biosecurity: No potential misuse or dual-use character in our project6 Flp Recombinase - A stable but reversible genetic alteration7 A practical contribution to Biosafety in iGEM projects: The kill-switch7.1 Aim of the new designed Thymidine kinase / ganciclovir system7.2 The role of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinaseBiosafety is defined as \"the discipline addressing the safe handling and containment of infectious microorganisms and hazardous biological materials\"[1] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC.For our team, the security and safety measures of our project have had the highest priority.Another positive effect is, that the bystander effect needs direct cell-cell contact because a soluble factor seems not to be involved [13].Upon exposure to a suitable stimulus Flp recombinase will be transcribed and excise the integrated plasmid from our synthetic organ.A practical contribution to Biosafety in iGEM projects: The kill-switchAim of the new designed Thymidine kinase / ganciclovir systemOne key factor in guaranteeing the safety of our project and preventing in advance any dangers is the implementation of a well-known kill-switch.The reason for selecting HSV-TK in combination with GCV is a result of its high specificity for the guanosine analogue compared to thymidine kinases [12].It is worth mentioning how there is a big debate about organ transplantation already since it first became possible in 1945 when the first kidney was successfully transplanted (HRSA).Due to its highly preferential metabolism penciclovir is more commonly selected for GMK-TK30 infected cells [18].Our Kill-Switch construct consists of a CMV-promoter, the GMK-TK30 and an additional Poly-A-tail.In contrast to some guanosine analogues like aciclovir, the active form of famciclovir, penciclovir, is even phosphorylated much more efficiently.Ganciclovir is known as the hydroxymethylated form of aciclovir and is known for its better activity against CMV [15].To get nearer to in vivo conditions in cell culture assays, the diacetyl ester, famciclovir, should be incubated in extracts of liver, previously processed by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase or implemented on a cell culture assay with cells that are capable of effectively transforming famciclovir.Nevertheless, the assumed effect was almost not observable, which shows that in the case of HEK293T cells famciclovir is not well suited for acting as an inducing drug for the GMK-TK30 Kill-Switch.Although HEK293T cells are known to produce aldehyde oxidase [19] and xanthine oxidase [20] the conversion of famciclovir into its active form penciclovir seems not to proceed effectively enough in HEK293T cells in order to be detectable by fluorescence microscopy.This is where the question comes, whether or not a printed organ should be considered as artificial or normal organs.Flp Recombinase - A stable but reversible genetic alterationIn our talks with medical doctors, pharmaceutical companies and the public one question always popped up: \u0084Can you undo the genetic engineering after the synthetic organ is transplanted into a humans body?\u0093We thought about this tricky question and finally came up with the idea to modify the well established \u0084T-REx\u0093 system.Like it is in the case with tumor cells, we assume that our printed tissue is dividing more frequently than its environment after implanting, especially if the printed tissue evolves malignant.Nevertheless, we have had an extreme caution to prevent any spreading of used living organisms, since this were S1 genetically modified organisms.The field of synthetic biology provides us with the possibility to work with living organisms and modify them.Since the base of synthetic biology is the work with genetically modified organisms (GMO), it is necessary to look out for risk factors like spreading of the organism or infection from the investigators.Figure 1: Team members listening (except Jan\u00a0;) ) to the lecture of Dr. Martin Schlapschy covering safety in the laboratory and the german genetic engineering law.The Laboratory in which the iGEM Project has been conducted, at the Chair of biological chemistry is classified as a laboratory with the biosafety level S1.Although it was demonstrated that phosphorylated GCV metabolites can leak out from cells, only neighboring cells are at risk to be killed by an unknown cellular uptake mechanism independent of gap junctions [14].In order to fulfill the iGEM-competition\u0092s philosophy, we intended to improve current BioBricks and the kill-switch, that was implemented for instance in Freiburg 2010 and Slovenia 2012.It is also important to highlight that molecular biology works at the laboratory involve the use of some harmful chemicals, which is another aspect of the safety to be considered.In this case, we worked in cooperation with the iGEM-team of Slovenia and Freiburg, who each provided us with their Biobrick (BBa_K404113 - HSV-thymidine kinase fused to mouse guanylate kinase, iGEM Freiburg 2010 and BBa_K782063 - CMV-promoter, iGEM Slovenia 2012).The \u0093bystander effect\u0094: tumor regression when a fraction of the tumor mass is genetically modified.The \u0093bystander effect\u0094: tumor regression when a fraction of the tumor mass is genetically modified.It is assumed that the bystander effect is based on apoptotic cell death.In order to test the functionality of our Kill-Switch, we transfected HEK293T cells with the construct.In the future case of implanting printed tissues into a patient, the bystander effect supports biosafety.It is important to underline some important safety measures that have to be taken while conducting molecular biology experiments:  The use of Ethidium bromide, since it is considered to be a mutagenic chemical compound.As an example the use of big centrifuges, which if mishandled could cause harm to the investigators.Biosafety: No danger to scientists, the population or the environmentIn the daily work with genetically modified microorganisms and cells, it is always important to consider various aspects of biosafety.Its prodrug famciclovir, with two acetyl groups instead of the hydroxyl groups and without the keto group at the purine (see Figure..).When planning and conducting experiments one has to evaluate all potential risks and dangerous posed to human health and the environment thereby and take all eventual necessary precautionary measures (precaution principle).We are suggesting to encode the Flp recombinase, on the same plasmid as the integration cassette, under the control of a tight promoter like the tet-promoter.The trimethylated state is obviously the active form of the prodrugs [9].[3]etbr.html This measures also applied for compounds like Hydrochloric acid and Ammonia, additionally this were to be handled with the protection of a fume hood, due to the volatility of some of them.Nevertheless, all four guanosine analogues show adverse side effects, especially on the male reproductive system [17].The major metabolism of orally admitted famciclovir includes normally a deacetylation followed by oxidation of the purine to form penciclovir.Penciclovir has lower bioavailability than the other two guanosine analogues.Since there are many inherent risks of our work in the iGEM laboratory, we have decided to thoroughly present the dangers that we have analyzed while working at it.This specific kill switch is known as the Thymidine kinase / ganciclovir system.The system is based on a FRT site encoded on a plasmid and another FRT site in the genome.Replacement of the ether oxygen by a carbon atom reflects the structure of penciclovir.This is how the prodrug works in vivo.[2] In order to guarantee the integrity of all the team members and the environment, we took preventive steps prior to the beginning of our lab work.Suggested utilisation of the system for a reversible genetic engineering by inducible excision.Firstly it is relevant to mention that we used non-pathogenic E. coli strains like BL21 and Xl1-blue for the cloning part of the project, which are typical strains used in the labs.After this, all team members were given an introduction to the laboratory, in order to get to know all important safety features as well as localization of the proper lab equipment.Under this principle, general contact with the biological material, for instance, shall be reduced to a minimum.As our project relies on a variety of wet lab work all constructs and experiments were carefully checked ahead of execution.With this design we could ensure that the integration plasmid and the Flp recombinase are always present in any cell.This is why it is very important to consider all these political, social and ethical issues bonded to the scope and effect of the project.In the Level S1 there is considered that no risk for human health or the environment is present.The use of a special protective mask in order to protect the eyes from the UV Light while analyzing gels.But more likely is the excision of an integrated plasmid.Finally, we can only assume that the reason for the weakness of famciclovir as an inducer of apoptosis may be due to its complex metabolism.After a site-directed mutagenesis (Quickchange) the restriction site was removed and the sequence hence repaired.Therefore, we did not only erase point mutations in the mGMK-TK30-construct and added a Poly-A-tail, but went on using the current most modern prodrug: famciclovir.Constructs for example that allow for the production of any kind of toxins or dangerous chemicals as well as genetic code that allows for the integration or transmission of DNA.As we have evaluated our project accordingly we were not able to find any aspect of our work which could be used or modified to serve exterior unwanted purposes.There are many safety measures that are very important to consider while investigating and working at the laboratory for this purpose.After successful transfection of mGMK-TK30 fusion protein the following incubation with one of the mentioned guanosine analogues leads initially to monophosphorylation followed by di- and trimethylation by cellular kinases.At the end, this specificity leads to directed cell death.Upon plasmid loss the integration cassette can no longer be excised and the cell is stable genetically altered.Since a higher frequency of cytokinesis influences transfection positively, printed tissues would be targeted more directly by the bystander effect.No part allows for the production of any kind of harmful substances nor the spread of the construct themselves.The topic of bioprinting, due to the fact of being relatively young, is still currently being discussed in international ethics and safety forums and in courts.First, since for medication 4 common drugs are available on the market, we intended to analyze the differences between them in more detail.Researches address to this phenomenon as the \u0093Bystander Effect\u0094.The use of certain machines at the laboratory posed some risks as well.To implement a kill switch on famciclovir basis has the clear advantage of using the most actual drug that has higher biocompatibility and bioavailability (41%) in humans.By recombineering of these sites, catalysed by Flp recombinase, the plasmid is integrated.To compare GCV to thymidine, it is 500-fold more catalytic active in the case of thymidine than GCV.These being questions about the ethic of some projects and furthermore the regulation of the reproduction of the same experiments, in the case of its success.[5]Another important factor to consider and discuss is the patentability of such a printer, or in the given case of the printed products.To illustrate this problem, as an example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in charge of regulating medical devices as artificial hearts.All team members that were going to be performing wet lab tasks were required to attend a lecture about the risks and precautions while working with GMOs.With aciclovir the new era of antiviral therapy started in the 1980s.In this presentation information about the regulation of biology by governmental institutions in Germany and the obligations each laboratory has to fulfill e.g.Sequencing results showed a point mutation in both the part by the iGEM team of Freiburg 2010 and the Slovenian part of 2012.It was conducted by Dr. Martin Schlapschy in charge of the safety of the laboratory.? Freeman, S. M., Abboud, C. N., Whartenby, K. A., Packman, C. H., Koeplin, D. S., Moolten, F. L., & Abraham, G. N. (1993).? Freeman, S. M., Abboud, C. N., Whartenby, K. A., Packman, C. H., Koeplin, D. S., Moolten, F. L., & Abraham, G. N. (1993).Our work in the laboratory was determined not to pose any kind of unusual risks neither to the experimenters nor the general public or the environment.According to the German law of the regulation of GM technology (Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik) there are 4 levels of biosafety, namely from S1 to S4.Considering the fact that the transplantation of these organs needs still years of research of becoming a reality, the governments and regulation organisms are facing a great challenge in regulating the use and manufacture of 3D printed organs.The strict containment of the experiments within the lab was ensured at all times.Quantitative analysis by mRNA measuring of Poly-A-sequence addition showed 4.6-fold higher mRNA stability in comparison to the non-Poly-A-construct.Each one of the Poly-A/Non-Poly-A cross-point-values was proportioned to the negative control and house-keeping gene values.Meanwhile is Organ Donation regulated by other governmental agreements, like in the case of Illinois, the Anatomical gift act.One of the biggest security concerns around the use of 3D printed organs for transplantation is the tort liability of physicians, added to the intellectual property debate of 3D produced organs.? Qiu, R., Horvath, A., & Stahlmann, R. (2016).? Qiu, R., Horvath, A., & Stahlmann, R. (2016).The world is facing a lot of challenges nowadays with the constant improvement and advances in the field of biology.For iGEM, it may be also of great interest to take the mouse GMK since it is soluble in E. coli in comparison to its human analogue [8].Nevertheless, in uninfected cells, host cell kinases phosphorylate both guanosine analogues to a small and similar content.The effect of, for instance, GCV on HSV-negative cells seems to be an in vitro result for experiments where cultured cells contained at least 10% HSV-TK-positive cells.?

& Stipanuk, 2006).Conservation of functional residues within eukaryotic and putative bacterial CDOsAlso in 2013, the paper \u0093Discovery of a substrate selectivity motif in amino acid decarboxylases unveils a taurine biosynthesis pathway in prokaryotes\u0094 publish that the sequence, structural, and mutational analyses of the structurally and sequentially related hCSAD and human glutamic acid decarboxylase (huGADL) enzymes revealed a three residue substrate recognition motif, within the active site that is responsible for coordinating their respective preferred amino acid substrates.Mammalian cysteine metabolism and Hypotaurine formation in mitochondria.However more experiments about the taurine and hypotaurine production and function have been carried out in eukaryotic organisms.In 2006 a study of in vivo production of taurine, hypotaurine and sulfate following subcutaneous administration of L-cysteinesulfinate (CSA) to rats and mice indicate that liver is the most active tissue for taurine production, followed by kidney, also that external CSA, hypotaurine and taurine are easily taken up by these tissues (Nakamura, Yatsuki & Ubuka, 2006).In 2008, in an investigation of the hypotaurine production from L-cysteinesulfinate in rat liver mitochondria was indicated the presence of L-cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase activity and the possibility of antioxidant roles of cysteine metabolites like hypotaurine (Ubuka, Okada & Nakamura, 2008).In 2010, in the publication \u0093Enhancement of menadione stress tolerance in yeast by accumulation of hypotaurine and taurine: co-expression of cDNA clones, from Cyprinus carpio, for cysteine dioxygenase and cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u0094, taurine was used as a compatible solute for stress tolerance of yeast, isolation of cDNA clones for genes encoding enzymes involved in biosynthesis of taurine was attempted.We chose this project because the idea has not been developed yet using synthetic biology and because of the market potential that has emerged around taurine.There are several ways in which hypotaurine is biosynthesized from cysteine, but the simplest and shortest one found was the one that acts via oxidation of cysteine with the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), followed by the decarboxylation of cysteinesulfinate using the enzyme cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) to produce hypotaurine.When the genetically modified E. coli is cultured in a cysteine-rich medium these enzymes will be in charge of catalyzing the reaction to produce hypotaurine, which leads to the opportunity to the production, purification and commercialization of this precursor of taurine.Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO, 2 EC 1.13.11.20) is a non-heme mononuclear iron metalloenzyme that catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) with addition of molecular oxygen.The plasmids shown below have different purposes, like only for the expression of the required enzymes, and plasmids that codify the sequence with poly his-tag to ease the purification of CDO and CSD.Figure N\u00b0 1. pSB1C3 with the construct for constitutive expression of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD).Figure N\u00b0 2: pSB1C3 with the construct for constitutive expression of CDO enzyme with a poly-his tag attached downstream to ease the protein purification.For this device (BBa_K2004009), both enzyme sequences were joined to a RBS sequence (BBa_J61101) at the 5\u0092 side, a constitutive promoter sequence (BBa_J23106) upstream at the 5\u0092 end and a double terminator sequence (BBa_B0012) downstream at the 3\u0092 end.Furthermore, we have noticed that protein purification is an essential step to further experiments and analysis of the system behavior, because of this we decided to fuse the optimized enzyme sequences (CDO and GADL) with another registered part which is a poly his tag (BBa_K844000) designed by iGEM12_Utah_State team.A culture with a proper expression of the CDO construct (BBa_K2004011), will be green because the reporter gene located downstream of this sequence, which codifies to Green fluorescent protein (GFP).Meanwhile, the CSAD construct (BBa_K2004012) will produce this enzyme and a pink chromoprotein because both gene sequences are together next to its constitutive promoter.This enzyme has a length of 200 aminoacids and a mass of 22,972 Daltons (UniProt, 2005).The product of the reaction catalyzed by CDO, cysteine sulfinic acid, is either decarboxylated to hypotaurine, which is further oxidized to taurine by a poorly understood mechanism, or transaminated to the putative intermediate 3-sulfinylpyruvate that spontaneously decomposes to pyruvate and sulfite, with sulfite being further oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase.CDO is one of the most highly regulated metabolic enzymes responding to diet that is known (Stipanuk et al., 2008).CDO is known to be expressed in the brain, kidney, and lung, with significantly high levels in liver tissue, where this enzyme has an important role in maintaining the hepatic concentration of intracellular free cysteine (Ye et al., 2007).It is believed that CDO is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson and Alzheimer, and also in autoimmune diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, due to its function in regulating free cysteine levels (Ye et al., 2007).Two types of cDNA clones corresponding to genes encoding cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1 and CDO2) and a cDNA clone for cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase (CSD) were isolated from Cyprinus carpio.Although there are no records of iGEM teams who have worked with the direct bioproduction of taurine or hypotaurine, some teams have used them as precursors for other purposes in their projects.Dominy, J., Simmons, C., Karplus, P., Gehring, A., & Stipanuk, M. (2006).The cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase enzyme (CSAD), also known as sulfoalanine decarboxylase, is an enzyme involved in the hypotaurine biosynthesis.Figure N\u00b0 4: These constructs ease the identification of the respective enzymes because contains the sequence attached a reporter gene, GFP with CDO and SPISPINK with CSAD.Figure N\u00b0 5: Assembly shown above contain the sequences for a modified and improved version of the chromoprotein Spis Pink designed by BIOSINT_Mexico 2015 iGem team.The same happened with the GADL sequence to codify the CSAD enzyme, which is part of the Homo sapiens sequence; this sequence has been widely used in a experimental way to study the expression of this enzyme by using microorganism, so we cleaned up the sequence of restriction enzymes, optimize the sequence to be used into E. coli ((BBa_K2004008).This device (BBa_K2004013) allows to test the fusion, because contains a constitutive promoter and a RBS upstream and the double terminator downstream.In order to get as a final result, the hypotaurine production, both enzymes CDO and CSAD must be together.A similar protein in rodents plays a role in multiple biological processes as the rate-limiting enzyme in taurine biosynthesis, catalyzing the decarboxylation of cysteine sulfinate to hypotaurine.Figure N\u00b0 3: pSB1C3 with the construct of constitutive promoter, CDA enzyme sequence with a poly-his tag attached downstream to ease its purification.It should be noted that the sequence used to the pink chromoprotein is a new and improved version of SpisPink part (BBa_1684000) designed by iGEM BIOSINT_Mexico 2015 team.In this way, a brief step to confirm the chromoprotein expression is purifying it, so to facilitate this process we fuse a improved version of the sequence (BBa_K2004004) that codifies to pink chromoprotein with another registered part, the poly his tag (BBa_K844000).The last version of this chromoprotein(BBa_K1684000), designed by the previous Biosint team, was analyzed according to its sequence and all the parameter that must meet to be part of a standardized biobrick.Meanwhile device in the right side is the chromoprotein with a poly-his tag attached downstream for a better protein purification.Several devices were designed with different purposes, some of them just correspond to the protein expression, CDO and CSAD, meanwhile other devices were built for help the protein purification and the protein expression identification in the wet lab by using chromoproteins like reporters.Recuperado el 27 de marzo de 2016, de http://www.javeriana.edu.co/Facultades/Ciencias/neurobioquimica/libros/neurobioquimica/taurina.htmIn 2006 were identified four proteins from Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Streptomyces coelicolor A3 that shared low overall identity and conserved important active-site residues to the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) which provides important oxidized metabolites of cysteine such as sulfate and taurine.Amino Acids, 35(1), 53-58. doi:10.1007/s00726-007-0633-xThis project aims to bioengineer E. coli in order to produce hypotaurine, the predecessor of taurine.From L-cysteine metabolism to be converted in 3-Sulfino-L-alanine to finally convert this substrate in Hypotaurine.Below are shown different constructs the team designed to ease the identification of a functional device, or right expression of the enzymes.In this way, there are two new modified parts, the first is BBa_K2004002, the fusion between CDO (BBa_K2004007) with Polyhis tag, and the respective constitutive promoter, RBS and double terminator.For carry out this project, we took the CDO1 sequence from Enterobacter aerogenes and we optimized the sequence to be able to express a functional enzyme in Escherichia coli (BBa_K2004007), besides the sequence was cleaned up of whatever restriction site, that is not part of the BBF RFC 10, that could generate troubles with the standard 3A Assembly.The hypotaurine is the key intermediate for taurine synthesis, it\u00b4s an obligatory precursor leading to taurine but also it has been proposed that hypotaurine may act as an antioxidant, although the mechanism of the oxidation of hypotaurine is not fully understood.The enzyme responsible of the transformation of hypotaurine to taurine, hypotaurine dehydrogenase has not been totally identified in some tissues, thus, some researchers suggest that the conversion may be nonenzimatic or either spontaneously.Brain, lung and sexual tissue contain high levels of hypotaurine, there is evidence to support that it can protect these cells from oxidative damage during hypotaurine quenching of carbon or oxygen-based free radicals can itself react with oxygen, removing dissolved oxygen from the microenvironment undergoing oxidative stress.Taurine and hypotaurine are closely linked.Hypotaurine differs from taurine only in the oxidation state of the sulfur center and the resulting change in the acidity of the molecule.The second device BBa_K2004010 is the corresponding to the GADL1 sequence, in the same conditions, assembled with its constitutive promoter, RBS and double terminator.Recent experimental data have shown that hypotaurine reacts rapidly and efficiently with the hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, and hydrogen peroxide.An Insight into the Mechanism of Human Cysteine Dioxygenase: KEY ROLES OF THE THIOETHER-BONDED TYROSINE-CYSTEINE COFACTOR.An important paralog of this gene is DDC.GADL1 encodes a member of the group 2 decarboxylase family.Most metabolic pathways give hypotaurine as a precursor to taurine.For this it was used PSI-BLAST searches and crystallographic information about the active-site geometry of mammalian CDOs.The device in the left correspond to the current chromoprotein sequenced with an improved stop site to end the transcription process.Figure shown above explains how the entire system works.", "design": "",

the high spectrum of applications they offer: this through a series of workshops where they are shown how to use certain softwares for plasmid assembly and gene blocks constructions, as well as simulations of DNA replications and all the machinery involved in these kind of processes; and a mini-summer camp where they are exposed to all the things Tec de Monterrey is doing in its science faculty in campus Queretaro, where the schools of Biotechnology, Agronomy and Food Science Engineering try to develop new sustainable projects in order to help the community and give it the much needed tools to improve old fashion techniques of production of any kind of bioproduct that are harmful to the environment, non efficient or more wasteful of resources (especially in a part of Mexico where the climate seasons tend to be a bit harsh and there\u0092s a severe problem with water supply and usage).The camp consisted on a series of conference talks from different professors of the university, lab workshops imparted by members of the Biosint_Mexico team, and of course several outdoor activities.Undoubtedly the support and collaboration between different institutions and iGEM team is vital to achieve this goal; there are many problems that arise throughout the development of the project to meet all the objectives; in this case the Guanajuato_Mx team, with all their encourage decided to participate in the annual version of Interlab Study, nevertheless, its iGEM kit was unfortunately not given them, so this study could hardly do.Finally, although it was a mutual

requirements to be fulfilled in order to do the following: creating and establishing a pilot plant that is capable of reproducing the lab experiment.This project had the specific intention of realize an estimation of the costs that a person will incur if he/she/they were planning to develop the iGEM Biosint_Mexico 2016 project at a semi-industrial scale.The CDO and CSAD lines overlap, as we assumed they are translated and degraded at the same rate.As we can see in the plot, in this simulation the enzyme concentration increases until it stabilizes at 90.9 nM, and there is no change in the cysteine concentration until CDO and CSAD have been produced.However, the code includes comments for changing this easily.This model can be seen as a template which describes how the system would work in general, and can easily be edited to improve it with Michaelis-Menten kinetics if the enzymes are characterized to get a more accurate representation.Below is a plot of how the system would behave with an initial cysteine concentration of 1000 nM.- Shipping cost for the reagents and materials(if the company settle down in Quer\u00e9taro M\u00e9xico).As part of the objectives the Biosint_Mexico team have, this pilot plant will be a microbiological fermentation unit capable of produce and extract hypotaurine for the enrichment of other food products, energetic beverages and food supplements.This simulation uses the parts and compositors MATLAB framework developed at MIT for the \u0093Principles of Synthetic Biology\u0094 edX course.The equations used to describe all reactions are based on the law of mass action, using estimated rate constants.We developed a MATLAB simulation in order to model how the system and concentrations would change through time.It includes the essential elements required to provide an overview of the net flow the company will be exposed to, such as: costs of all types, prices of every material/equipment/space and the initial monetary investment in order to start a company of this kind.This after find out that the molecule in question is highly used in the animals food industry as well as in the beverages ones.The two enzymatic reactions would be better modeled with Michaelis-Menten equations, but we could not find characterization information for our two specific enzymes, and therefore the simpler mass action equation was used with a single rate constant.", "notebook": "Undoubtedly the support and collaboration between different institutions and iGEM team is vital to achieve this goal; there are many problems that

Initiatives, Initiatives village, in which we presented our project and answered questions on iGEM and synthetic biology.We were the first team to present, at 9:30 in the morning, and ended with an interesting session of questions and answers, the public raised very good questions for us to think about, for our presentation and our project s progress.We thank the organizers of the Biodesign Nightscience for giving us the opportunity to present the project and convey synthetic biology approach to more diverse audience.It was an interesting first test at presenting and sharing results, the only drawbacks being hat at this stage of the project we did not have that much to present.Every team started in the morning by presenting its project, we all had posters and were exchanging with other iGEMers.A jury evaluated presentations and gave us good advice on our to present better and told us what part of our project to better linked with the rest.It was a good opportunity to explain our project Frank&Stain for the first time : we presented our main idea, our workflow, our goals, etc.It was a very good way to practice for the Jamboree and present a more defined project and first results.The Festival vivant is a event organised to learn about synthetic biology and have an informed debate on the future we wish to build with this technology.We participated in the European Experience, a big gathering for European iGEM teams organized by iGEM Evry and iGEM IONIS.On this day teams from Paris had a meeting, organized by Paris Pasteur team, at the Institut Pasteur, and everyone had to do a twenty minutes presentation of its project.This event gathered start ups, iGEM teams, designers and artists who presented their projects and their vision of the future synbio can inspire.Eventually on the last day, we co-animated a workshop on the future we can imagine with synthetic biology with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Tournier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, and Philippe Deterre, biologist at CNRS.Last but not least we had to very interesting conferences on Synthetic Biology in the afternoon.We also pitch our project during a conference held for this event in an amphitheater.We realy enjoyed ourselves this day and enjoyed exchanging with Paris team and learning about each other s project and progress.By exchanging with other iGEMers on our project they gave us feedback and ideas.", "modeling": "To better understand the enzyme-stain-fabric system.To choose an optimal binding affinity for our fabric binding domain.To predict how much enzyme activity improvement we can expect.But for a wide range of conditions, enzymatic activity is optimized at a binding activity around 10-4 M. For reference, this affinity is much lower than typical antibody-antigen interactions (10-9 M) and is within reach of our protein engineering methods.Our project began with the idea that we can effectively increase this concentration with a fabric binding domain (FBD).Under realistic conditions we predict that an optimal binding domain will improve activity by 100 or 1000 fold.What is the optimal affinity for a stain removing enzyme?We predict a 100 fold improvement from an optimzed enzymeTo act on stains, an enzyme must be concentrated at the fabric surface.Enzyme activity can be optimized at intermediate binding constants near 104 M-1.", "notebook": "Involvement of the plasmid pPGH1 in the phenol degradation of Pseudomonas putida strain H.

C with shaking to mid-logarithmic phase in LB solution containing antibiotic and 20 umol/l Cu++ (Sullivan et al., 2004)Induce by adding IPTG (500 umol/l) and grown for an additional 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 \u00d7 g for 1 min and resuspended in PBS buffer.Lysozyme was added to 100 ?g ml?1, and the suspen sion was incubated at room temperature for 15 min.All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 ? C or on ice:The inclusion bodies were separated from the soluble extracts by centrifuging at 10,000 \u00d7g for 10 min.Carry out a second round of panning: repeat DAY 1 using the calculated amount of the first round amplified eluate as input phage, and raising the Tween concentration in the wash steps to 0.5% (v/v).No band should appear in the negative control, so that no contamination during the PCR preparation could interfere with the sample s bacterial identification.The PCR purifcation was performed using the QIAquick\u00ae PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) :Add 5 volumes of binding buffer to 1 volume of PCR product in a sterile 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube, mix by pipetting up and down.Continue shaking at 37\u00b0C for 5 hr.Centrifuge samples at 4000rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, remove supernatant, they are ready to do the cell extract, with agents such as B-PER for example, or resuspend them in glycerol 30% in water to be stored at -80C.Clontech Laboratories, Inc. pET Express & Purify Kits User ManualMeasure the OD600 of the cells, and harvest them by centrifugationResuspend the cells in the appropriate volume of 2x Laemmili sample buffer so that OD600 of the cells is 10The cell extract was mixed 1:1 with Laemmili sample bufferThe electrophoresis is run under the following conditions: - After 10 min the samples have reached the separating gel, so the current is increased to 50 mA and ran until the front line reached the bottom of the gel.Gels are washed 3x for 5 min in miliQ water to remove the SDS.Staining is performed with BIO-RAD Comassie dye for 30 min with gentle shaking Assaying the strength or the Fabric Binding Domains using the assay developed by our team We assayed the strength or the Fabric Binding Domains using the assay developed by our team, carrying cotton, wool, silk and linen fabrics.Put the column in a sterile 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.Add directly to the center of the column 35 ?L of the elution buffer.Discard the column and stock the solution at 4\u00b0C before quantification.DNA quantification was performed with the Thermo Science Nanodrop 2000 and enabled to check if our PCR purification product fit with GATC samples requirements.Notably, the PCR product concentration needs to be between 20 and 80 ng/?l.Per sample, two 1,5 mL microcentrifuge tubes will be necessary.In both, add 5?L of the purified DNA at the proper concentration ( For instance, a dilution with sterile water is thus possible if the concentration is higher than 80 ng/?L).Add 5?L of the forward primer in one of the tube, and the reverse in the other tube (we used a concentration of 10 uM).The purpose is here to generate a consensus sequence for each sample, based on the alignement of the two chromatogram (AB1 file) obtained through GATC.16s rRNA PCR protocols for bacterial identification Pick a single colony freshly struck into 10 ?L of sterile RNAse and DNAse free water (purchased from Gifco\u00ae), in a PCR tube.Fresh colonies (grown that day) work best, but they can also come from 4\u00b0C.2 ?l can then be used directly for PCR but the solution can also be stored at 4\u00b0C for a few days.The following PCR protocol was followed : The extent temperature was chosen according to the PCR product length.The following primers were purchased from IDT, stocked at -20\u00b0C at a 100 ?M concentration.Use a sterile wooden stick or pipette tip to stab a blue plaque from a titering plate (important: plates should be less than 1\u00963 days old, stored at 4\u00b0C and have less than 100 plaques) and transfer to a tube containing the diluted culture.When the culture in Step 1 reaches mid-log phase, dispense 200 ?l into microfuge tubes, one for each phage dilution.After the first centrifugation in Step 4, transfer 500 \u00b5l of the phage-containing supernatant to a fresh microfuge tube.Carry out a third round of panning: repeat DAY 1 (steps 1 to 9 only), using the second round amplified eluate at an input titer equivalent to what was used in the first round, again using 0.5% Tween in the wash steps.For long-term storage, add an equal volume of sterile glycerol and store at \u009620\u00b0 C. Incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C a new piece of fabric/thread in 1mL of blocking buffer for the 2nd round of panning.Then apply to the QIAamp Mini spin column in 2 mL collection tube and centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min.Cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl.Pick colonies to inoculate small (5 ml) LB + antibiotic cultures and shake overnight at 37\u00b0CIn the morning, inoculate a new culture by diluting the overnight culture 1/100 to 1/1000 with LB + antibioticGrow shaking at 37\u00baC until an OD of 0.5\u00960.8 is reached, and then add IPTG to a concentration of 0.5 - 1 mM.Immediately prior to the detection step, add 36 ?l of 30% H2O2 to 21 ml of ABTS stock solution per plate to be analyzed.Add 5 ?l of phage stock from Step 1(or a single phage plaque) to a 20 ml culture for each clone and incubate with vigorous aeration for 4.5\u00965 hours at 37\u00b0C.Dilute a 25-fold representation of the library (e.g., 2 x 10 11 phage for a library with 2 x 10 9 clones) with 250\u00b5l of TBST (therefore add 10\u00b5L of phage library).The next day, dilute the overnight culture 1:100 in 20 ml of LB in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask (do not use a 50 ml conical tube) and add the unamplified eluate.Note: The remaining eluate can be stored overnight at 4\u00b0C at this point, if preferred, and amplified the next day.In the separate blocked plate, carry out fourfold serial dilutions of the phage in 200 ?l of TBS/Tween per well, starting with 10^12 virions in the first well of a row and ending with 2 x 10^5 virions in the 12th well.Alternatively, after inoculation of the titering culture incubate the piece of fabric/thread at least 1 hour at 4\u00b0C on DAY 1.Incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C a new piece of fabric/thread with 1mL of blocking buffer for the 3rd round of panning.Place the spin column in a clean 2 mL collection tube, add 500 \u00b5L buffer AW1 to spin column (carefully) and centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 1 m.  Place the spin column in clean 2 mL collection tube again, add 500 \u00b5L buffer AW2.Pipette 5 ?L of each PCR product inside a different well.Pipette 5 ?L of a 1kb ladder  purchased to Thermofisher) in one of the wells (better if it flanks the PCR products when there is many of them).Close the machine and launch the migration with a 100V voltage and wait approximately 20 minutes.Add 500 \u00b5L lyticase solution to the cell pellets and incubate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C.Washes were increased to 1ml * 5 times.For the Golden Gate assembly (GG) here we fused two protocols, using part of the one facilitated by NEB Golden Gate Assembly Mix, which contains BsaI and T4 DNA Ligase, and another which we had by courtesy of our advisor Nadine Bongaerts: Once this is done the product of the reaction can be transformed avoiding to use electroporation, since it could be ions still in the mixIn this protocol volumes and other quantities used are proportional.To carry out infection, add 10 ?l of each phage dilution to each tube, vortex quickly, and incubate at room temperature for 1\u00965 minutes.Transfer the culture to a centrifuge tube and spin at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C.Transfer the culture to a centrifuge tube and spin for 10 minutes at 12,000 g at 4\u00b0C.Inoculate 20mL of LB medium in a 250mL Erlenmeyer flask just before the end of the incubation period of the fabric in the phage library solution.Microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, discard the supernatant, re-spin briefly, and remove residual supernatant with a micropipet.Count blue plaques from the titering plates in Step 6 of DAY 2 and determine the phage titer, which should be on the order of 1013\u009614 pfu/ml.Spin in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and discard the supernatant.In TE buffer, the phage DNA should be stable indefinitely at \u009620\u00b0C.Elute bound phage with 1 ml of an ap\u00acpropriate elution buffer for the interaction being studied.Wash the fabric rapidly 10 times with TBST 0.1% (TBS + 0.1% [v/v] Tween-20) by dipping the threads in a well from a six-well plate filled with ~8mL TBST per well and going back and forth through the washing solution.Transfer the suspension to a microcentrifuge tube and spin at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet residual cells.This protocol was inspired by a protocol called \u0093Isolation of genomic DNA from fungi (culture and blood) using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit\u0094 that can be found under the section user-developed protocol here  In this protocol we use lyticase, thus before doing our dna extraction we prepared lyticase aliquots: Store in a freezer at -20\u00b0C (or the lyticase will loose efficiency) DNA is isolated from fungi grown 48h to 72h on Sabouraud medium at 30\u00b0C, so 3 days before going through the dna extraction we inoculated our fungal strains on Sabouraud.The phage pellet should be a white finger print sized smear on the side of the tube.Transfer the suspension to a micro\u00accentrifuge tube and spin at maximum (14,000 rpm) for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet residual cells.Titer the amplified eluate as described in the Phage Titering protocol.A second, fully uncoated microtiter plate should be blocked for use in serial dilutions of phage (step 13) before addition to the target-coated plate.Titer a small amount (~2 ?l) of the eluate as described in the Phage Titering protocol.If the phage titer of the amplified eluate is too low, succeeding rounds of panning can be carried out with as little as 109 pfu of input phage.Dilutions are done in a separate blocked plate to ensure that phage are not absorbed onto the target during the course of performing dilutions, which would result in a sudden \u0093falling-off\u0094 of signal as the phage is diluted.Plaques from the titering can be used for sequencing: time the procedure so that plates are incubated at 37\u00b0C for no longer than 18 hours, as deletions may occur if plates are grown longer.The NEB Quick-Load\u00ae Taq 2X Master Mix was used in the following master mix :The following protocol was followed : The extent temperature was chosen according to the PCR product length.The following primers were purchased from IDT, stocked at -20\u00b0C at a 100 ?M concentration.Place the piece of fabric/thread in the Eppendorf tube containing the library and rock gently for 60 minutes at room temperature.Plaques from the first or second round eluate titering can be sequenced if desired.Multiply each number by the dilution factor for that plate to get phage titer in plaque forming units (pfu) per 10\u00b5L.After that, place spin columns in a 1.5 mL tube, and add 50 \u00b5L distilled water.Transfer the upper 80% of the supernatant to a fresh tube and add to it 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and re-spin (discard the pellet).Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and re-spin (discard the pellet).Add 5?L of SYBR\u00ae Safe (10000X) and mix gently until the solution homogenizes.Use this value to calculate an input volume corresponding to the input titer in Step 3 of DAY 1.Using a multichannel pipettor, transfer 100 ?l from each row of diluted phage to a row of target-coated wells, and transfer 100 ?l to a row without target.The percentage of Tween should be the same as the concentration used in the panning wash steps.In our experiments we measure the fluorescence of the GFP fused with the FBD, therefore we set the plate reader to excite the samples with a wavelength of 475nm and for the emission a wavelength of 515nm.We also wash the sample with different washing solutions, these were:1.Carry out the plaque amplification procedure described in the Phage Amplification protocol.Pipette the upper 80% of the supernatant to a fresh tube and add 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl.Then, the Targeted Loci BLAST tool on NCBI enables to identify the strain.Whole Genomic Sequencing was performed using Illumina\u00ae Technology at GATC\u00ae, for 5 strains (4 gram negative and one gram positive).Genomic DNA extraction was performed with the Qiagen\u00ae DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit.The followed protocol was indicated in Qiagen\u00ae handbook.Remove piece of fabric/thread from the Eppendorf tube.Shake out the blocking buffer and wash each plate 10 times with TBST, slapping the plate face-down onto a clean section of paper towel each time.One part of the cell culture is diluted in 50 parts of LB broth.Add 200 ?l of substrate solution to each well, and incubate for 10\u009660 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation.Remove the piece of fabric/thread from the blocking solution.As for genomic dna isolation:Harvest colonies using an inoculating loop and resuspend them in 1 mL of 0.9% saline solution in 1,5 mL tubes, centrifuge and collect the cell pellets (we did by pipetting the supernatant).Decant and discard the supernatant, re-spin the tube briefly, and remove residual supernatant with a pipette.Amplify the rest of the eluate by adding the eluate to the 20-ml ER2738 culture from Step 4 (should be early-log at this point, i.e.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and reprecipitate by adding 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and re-precipitate with 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl.For each clone to be characterized, dilute an overnight culture of ER2738 1:100 in 20 ml of LB.Dispense 1 ml of diluted culture into culture tubes, one for each clone to be characterized.Mix 0.5g of agarose with 50mL of a 0.5X TBE solution in an Erlenmeyer.Heat the solution in a microwave until the liquid becomes totally transparent, avoid

eluate from the 2nd round.First wash by adding 200ul of washing solution and removing it after 30 secondsThis protocol is based in the one carried out by Imperial College London iGEM team 2014, which project was called Aqualose.Place spin columns in a new collection tube and centrifuge at full speed for 1 min.Pour the liquid in a gel mold with the desired number of wells and wait 20-30 min (or until the gel is solidified).Put the gel inside the electrophoresis machine and pour TBE 0.5X until the gel is totally submerged.Carry out the plaque amplification procedure described previously- After the first centrifugation, save the phage-containing supernatants at 4\u00b0C.Using a pipette, transfer the upper 80% of the supernatant to a fresh tube.Transfer in a centrifugation column and centrifuge 1 min at 14000 rpm.Inoculate 10mL of LB with ER2738 from a plate and incubate with shaking ~3-4 hours (mid-log phase, OD600 ~ 0.5).A volume of 200ul is incubated 24 hours in each well of the assay plate.3.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and re-spin.Soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis).Cells carrying the recombinant plasmid were grown at 37 \u00b0C in LB + antibiotic (100 ?g/mL)(I guess at OD 0.6 were) induced by adding 0.4 mM IPTG.After induction, the cells were grown at 22 \u00b0C during 20 h and collected by centrifugation.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.Elisa was first performed in the 96 well plate with the target (fabric) developed by the Assay team.Check that the third nucleotide of each codon in the randomized region is G or T. TAG stop codons are suppressed by glutamine in ER2738 (glnV).All protocols displayed here are identical to the ones provided in the NEB Ph.D.\u0099-7 Phage Display Peptide Libraries Instruction Manual, except for the Panning Procedure that was adapted to our needs.#27-9421-01) in blocking buffer to the final dilution recommended by the manufacturer.Add 200 ?l of diluted conjugate to each well and incubate at room temperature for 1 hour with agitation.Libraries often contain a small percentage (less than 1%) of clones containing multiple inserts of the randomized region.If the library was amplified in this strain or any glnV (also known as supE) strain, TAG should be considered a glutamine codon when translating.Add 200 \u00b5L buffer AL, mix by pulse vortexing for 15s, and incubate at 70\u00b0C for 10 min.10\u009620 clones from the third round are usually sufficient to detect a consensus binding sequence.Decant and discard the supernatant, re-spin briefly, and remove residual supernatant with a pipette.Discard the supernatant, re-spin briefly, and remove residual supernatant with a micropipet.While cells are growing, melt Top Agar in microwave and dispense 3 ml into sterile culture tubes, one per expected phage dilution.All the reagent volumes were the same.Microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and discard the supernatant.Do not amplify the third round eluate and carry out a fourth round of panning unless the characterization shows no clear consensus sequence or phage ELISA results are negative.Transfer the infected cells one infection at a time to culture tubes containing 45\u00b0C Top Agar.Prepare 10 to 103 -fold serial dilutions of phage in LB; 1 ml final volumes are convenient.The protocol was later performed in micro-centrifuge tubes to reduce non specific binding of peptides to the polystyrene.Wash the pellet with 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol (stored at \u009620\u00b0C), re-spin, discard the supernatant, and briefly dry the pellet under vacuum.Inoculate 10 ml of LB+Tet with ER2738 and incubate with shaking overnight at 37\u00b0C.The phage stock can be stored for several weeks at 4\u00b0C.In this case, inoculate 10 ml of LB+Tet with ER2738 and incubate with shaking overnight at 37\u00b0C.Inoculate 10 ml of LB+Tet medium with ER2738 in a 125mL Erlenmeyer flask.By applying simple mathematical operations of multiplication or division one can adjust the protocol based on his/her needs.Grow minimum 25 mL of overnight culture of BL21(DH3)-bpul in liquid Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with chloramphenicol.In the morning, prepare 1L of LB broth in 2L Erlenmeyer flask and add 20 mL of overnight BL21(DH3)-bpuI cell culture.The sequence being read corresponds to the anticodon strand of the template.Write out the complementary strand

extract5.Selected phage clones can be identified by DNA sequencing, and target specificity can be confirmed by phage ELISA.Allow the plates to cool for 5 minutes, invert, and incubate overnight at 37\u00b0C.For preparation of individual clones for sequencing or ELISA, set up a 10-ml overnight culture of ER2738 from a colony, not by diluting the titering culture.This was performed with the Geneious De Novo Assembly tool.Incubate at room temperature for 1 min, then centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 1 min.Incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C the piece of fabric/thread with 1mL of blocking buffer.", "result": "The circles of cotton stay on the glass substrate.Hold it tight and move the glass substrate laterally so that all the cotton circles fall into the wells.Additionally, we have shown that more than 60% of indigo can be degraded by bpul laccase in the 13 hours of the experiment.The cell extracts of both strains were tested for the ability to degrade indigo carmine and indigo.The same can be done for other fabrics like silk, polystyrene, nylon etc.An Image processing plugin was developed to measure the pixel intensity of each well of the scanned image of Microplate on fabric.All results shown in the figure above are made with our bpul gene expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3).ACS is a known mediator of the laccases and it is often used and needed in the studies of the laccase activitiy As expected, the 1mM indigo carmine solution is entirely degraded within the 13 hours of the experiment in the cell extract which contains overexpressed bpul.It is important to notice, that in longer experiments would probably lead to even more degradation since the degradation curve didn t reach the saturation.Construction of the strain database by the microbiology teamThis summer, our group designed an experiment to find the best stain fighting enzymes that nature has to offer.Place the glass substrate of cotton circles on fluorescent microplate such that all circles face the wells and align well.In the degradation experiments (figure above C and D), both the transformant BL21(DE3)-bpul, and the negative control BL21(DE3) have been induced with IPTG.Automated/DIY microplate on fabric-Image processing tool for stain measurementAn automated 96 well microplate for fabric was made using a fluorescent microplate, 96 well tip holder and laser-cut cotton circles.Put the tip plate holder on the top of the microplate and adhere it to the microplate using a glue.When comparing uninduced bpul sample with the control sample (BL21(DE3)) we can notice leakiness of our promoter, which is probably due to great transcriptional strength of T7 polymerase.Cover it with a lid and the microplate is ready to use for experiments.The relative change in pixel intensity is the quantitative measure for degradation of stain.The protein gel (figure above B) is showing an over-expression of the bpul, after the induction with IPTG.Catechol dioxydases were expressed with and without Fabric Binding Domains and their functionality was demonstrated in both casesSix candidate plant and bacterial enzymes were tested for expression in E. coliThree out of six enzymes were functionally expressed in E. coli and tested for their ability to degrade their natural substrateFeasibility of fusing proteins with FBDs was tested by fusing them to GFP and assessing their GFP ability and their ability to bind to several fabricsThe selected enzymes were fused with Fabric Binding Domains and their activity was still observedWe succeeded in finding 16 microbes that grow on denim, covered with M9 media.96 Wet cotton circles of 6.5mm are laser cut on glass substrate.", "safety": "Currently the use of enzymes as cleaning agents accounts for 60% of all enzyme production (Niyonzima 2015).The main drawback to enzyme use is currently the high cost of production, although improvements in fermentation efficiency may help reduce these costs.Safety and Regulatory Considerations for Enzymatic ProductsThe use of GMOs is heavily regulated in France, particularly in regards to agriculture; in general regulation in France follows the guidelines of the European Union in terms of GMO definition and use and study rules.For industrial use, authority is given to the local prefect rather than the research ministry (Loi n\u00b0 2008-595 Art L. 532).In general, enzymes have been produced at industrial scale and used in consumer products for several decades and have been extensively studied for their potential risks to human health.The most well documented health hazards are to factory workers exposed to aerosolized enzymes at high concentrations or for extended times.In practice, exposure levels to enzymes in consumer products are much lower and probably present no health risks (Basketer, 2008).As a result, large-scale enzyme production facilities are subject to regulatory monitoring for air quality, employee health, and employee education for health risks.Lancet (London, England), 1(7607), 1177\u00961181.Niyonzima 2015 Coproduction of detergent compatible bacterial enzymes and stain removal evaluation.Our project involves the discovery and use of microbial enzymes for removing stains from fabrics in an environmentally conscious way, making it less likely to face public or regulatory challenges.Only two patients produced positive results, and neither of these could be confirmed with a clinical response to enzyme exposure (Pepys, 1973).Even so, GMO use must be declared to the government.These regulatory controls are generally effective, with aerosol enzyme levels exceeding regulatory standards in <1% of more than 300,000 readings in 2010 (Basketer, 2015).At the consumer level, guidelines for enzyme exposure levels are one-tenth the occupational exposure limit.These enzymes are used as supplements to detergents.Basketter, D. A., English, J. S. C., Wakelin, S. H., & White, I. R. (2008).Managing the Risk of Occupational Allergy in the Enzyme Detergent Industry.This has been linked to respiratory allergy (Flindt, 1969) and asthma (Cullinan, 2000).This would help us realize our goal of making a meaningful application useful in real life.Enzymes have been used to fight stains since the mid-20th century, and are used to enhance the action of detergents, both by improving stain degradation capabilities and through fabric protection.Cellulases break down cellulose polymers into glucose.Amylases digest starch polymers to simple sugars.Cullinan, P., Harris, J. M., Newman Taylor, A. J., Hole, A. M., Jones, M., Barnes, F., & Jolliffe, G. (2000).As a result, GMO projects are mainly confined to theoretical use.Flindt, M. L. (1969).Enzymes replaced the previously used petroleum-derived synthetic surfactants.French guidelines state that GMOs can be subject to prior authorization, unless health or environmental risks are minimal.", "keywords": "scientific concentration salicylate chlorophyll illustrated Photosystem therapeutic tetrapyrrolic characterized BBa_K1875016", "track": "Manufacturing", "part_favorite":

M9 minimum media with 0,1%, 0,25%, 0,01%, 1% and 0,5% of different sugars: arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, melibiose.These are the results under UV light:XylS is much stronger than XylF, and 0,25% of xylose in M9 medium is enough for a good expression in longer (44,5h in this example) culture.We also checked Arashort1 and Arashort2 on M9 medium with 0,01%, 0,1%, 0,25%, 0,5% and 1% of arabinose (44,5h, 37\u00b0C): And RhaWT and Rha without EcoRI - 0,01%, 0,1%, 0,25%, 0,5%, 1% of arabinose (44,5h, 37\u00b0C): The fluorescence of all the previous samples was measured using Denovix (see Methods).We prepared bacterial glycerol stocks with RhaWT, proRha1 without EcoRI, proRha2, AraWT, Arashort1, Arashort2, XylS, XylF and proD.(See Methods)So as we can see in the picture, our proRha1 is acting in a good way- it is induced by rhamnose (left) and the colonies don\u0092t produce fluorescent sfGFP on different carbon source- glucose.We picked the best colonies from proRha1 and proD and inoculated the overnight liquid LB with them in order to multiply bacteria that took up plasmid.The possible reason of that is the falsity of NanoDrop - maybe we didn t use enough amount of different elements.We tried to perform the assembly of our first constructs one more time using CPEC, but this time we used two times more nanograms of elements then last time.We also prepared fragments for our next construct: proD-sfGFP, which is an isolated, constitutive promoter; we amplified proD and sfGFP-D- with overlaps for each other and with overlaps for plasmid.We performed the elution of proD and sfGFPD.We also used AraGFP-WT as a control.We inoculated some of the colonies on the M9 minimal medium with agarose/glucose to investigate how those promoters work.This is Arashort1 on arabinose (left) and on glucose (right; negative control).Then we diluted them and use as a template in a reamplification with primers that add overlaps:We performed elution of the desired agarose bands- everything went well and now we have fragments for the assembly with plasmid.We also precipitated constructs from our last CPEC (Arashort1 and proRha1 without EcoRI).We performed CPEC for proD-sfGFPD construct.We inoculated some of the colonies into M9 medium with glucose as a control (left) and with rhamnose for the induction (right):As it is seen on the picture, proRha2 is not as strong as RhaWT or proRha1 without EcoRI.After electroporation and incubation in 37\u00b0C we inoculated bacteria on Petri dishes.Unfortunately, there was nothing on those plates the next day- bacteria didn t grow.We performed CPEC for Arashort1 and Arashort2 one more time- we used more nanograms of different fragments (we started to think that NanoDrop is \u0093lying\u0094 and it overstates the results- it s telling us that the sample has more DNA, than it has in the reality).That s how they looked on minimum media- XylF is pretty weak- again glucose on the left and xylose on the right:We inoculated XylS and XylF on M9 minimum medium with 0,01%, 0,1%, 0,25%, 0,5% and 1% of xylose and incubated the culture for 44,5h in 37\u00b0C.XylS-sfGFP - a shortened form of the XylA1 promoter, since we have expected that catabolic repression should be weakened to enable the efficient induction of this promoter on standard media like LB.XylF-sfGFP - a DNA fragment containing only the XylF promoter with the original UTR of XylF gene upstream the sfGFP ORF.After reamplification of fragments with overlaps, we performed CPEC, purification of the product, and electroporation.After transformation with XylF we obtain only 3 colonies.And, as you can see, the induction occurs only in a presence of arabinose:We had our proC_thermometer construct on two Petri dishes with M9 medium with glucose- we put one in 37\u00b0C and second in 23\u00b0C.We tried to check, whether it is better to isolate them with isopropanol or ethanol.We found out that it is better to use isopropanol- on the gel, samples that were treated with isopropanol show no contamination of small RNAs (samples in the boxes- picture), whilst samples after ethanol have those low bands that represent those RNAs (=contamination).After sequencing our plasmids, we found out that constructs were assembled in a proper way, which is a very good news.After CPEC we purified constructs and completed electroporation with DH5?.We inoculated some colonies on M9 minimal medium with arabinose and with glucose (as a negative control).They started to show fluorescence on plates with arabinose, because it is required for the induction of expression in arabinose promoters.We inoculated some colonies from plates with arabinose into the overnight liquid LB medium.Once again we put bacteria with proC promoter into M9 medium with different sugars (0,5%), we also checked proC with thermometer and proD in that way.After PCR, we performed electrophoresis and elution of the desired bands:We performed CPEC reaction for the assembly of Arashort2 (Arashort2 + pSB1C3) and Arashort1 (Arashort1 + pSB1C3).We centrifuged the culture, resuspend the pellet in Mili Q water and put probes into a freezer.We think that those weights are so little, that there is no sense in measuring the weight in future experiments carried in 2/5ml tubes, cause it is really easy to make a mistake, and obtain false data.We performed the assembly of XylWT-sfGFP promoter, which is a promoter induced by xylose (we added sfGFP to it) and is present in E.coli.We performed CPEC reaction with our amplified fragments from previous week- CPEC is a circular polymerase extension cloning; the combining of different elements is possible thanks to overlaps (see Methods).The rule is, that one should take ten times less ng of template than it has base pairs- e.g.So we have to repeat it, starting from the beginning.We started amplifying fragments (with specially designed primers of course) for the next attempt for the Arashort1 assembly (let s hope that this time it will have sfGFP protein!).On Tecan we also measured 8h-cultures of arabinose and rhamnose promoters from last week.In order to compare our promoters with pET system (that uses T7 polymerase) we inoculated all of them into M9 with 0,5% of glucose.We picked single colonies and checked them on plates with M9 medium with 0,4% of rhamnose (which is an inducer) and with 0,4% of glucose (as a negative control)- bacteria on M9 with rhamnose should demonstrate fluorescency under UV light, because of sfGFP expression- proRha1 is induced by rhamnose.We purified constructs after CPEC (Arashort1 and Arashort2) and performed bacteria transformation- we also used AraGFP-WT construct as a control to check, whether our competent bacteria are not defective.The transformation was successful- bacteria grew on all the plates.We started to wonder, whether our fragments were amplified with proper primers, so we performed amplification of all fragments once again, just to be sure.We also amplified proC (which is an isolated, constitutive promoter, just like proD; they differ from each other only in one nucleotide) and proC with a thermometer (a hairpin at its 5 UTR) and sfGFP for them.(See Methods)We prepared cultures with bacteria that carry desired constructs in liquid LB medium, so that we can use them to inoculate M9 media the next day.That s a lot of tubes to label!The samples were incubating in 37\u00b0C for 24h, next we centrifuged them, resuspend the pellet in 100?l of water and measured them on Tecan fluorometer (using special 96-well plate; see Methods).After that we picked the best colonies from the plates and inoculated them into overnight LB liquid medium.We inoculated all of our promoters into M9 with all sugars (0,5%), in order to check, if they are tight (so the expression is only on their inducers, not on other carbon sources), or if they tend to leak.After that we performed plasmid isolation (see Methods).After sequencing: proC looks good, but Arashort1 doesn t- in a mysterious way we assembled it with Glo protein, not with sfGFP.We checked it by sequencing- they were assembled in a good way.We started amplifying fragments for the new construct- proRha2- which is a promoter induced by ramnose, but shorter- we will try to cut out the site responsible for catabolic repression.In order to start the culture we inoculated M9 media with the proper amount of bacteria, so that the final OD600 was about 0,1.After that, we performed plasmid isolation (see Methods).We centrifuged the cultures, resuspened the pellet in LB liquid medium, added glycerol (final concentration: 7%) and the antibiotic (chloramphenicol).Mel2-sfGFP- which is a shortened version; without PstI site (biobrick standards) and with changed 5 UTR- we exchanged it on 5 UTR that comes from the rhamnose promoter, it should position RBS element better.We also started amplification of fragments for Arashort2 (shorter arabinose promoter, without elements responsible for catabolic repression).XylWT: XylF-XylAwt-sfGFP - contains both promoters (xylA and F) oriented in the direction in which sfGFP expression is driven by the original xylA promoter copied from Escherichia coli genome.XylA1: XylF-XylA1-sfGFP containing both promoters oriented in the direction in which sfGFP expression is driven by xylA promoter , the 5 UTR has been modified to make it similar to RBS from a proD.add more GC pairs).We picked the best colonies from Arashort1 and proC and inoculated the overnight liquid LB with them in order to multiply bacteria that took up plasmid.We also made M9 minimum media with: 0,5% of xylose, 0,25% of xylose, 0,5% of arabinose, 0,5% of glucose, 0,5% of rhamnose.We were hoping that low temperature will stop the induction in this construct because of hairpin, that we created in the 5 UTR.We put stocks prepared in that way into the freezer (-20\u00b0C).Using specially designed primers and Rha-sfGFP-WT promoter as a template, we were able to amplify shorter version- proRha2-sfGFP.Those two bands represent shorter proRha2 with sfGFP.We purified it after the reaction and put it in the freezer (-20\u00b0C).We transformed DH5? using electroporation with Arashort1 and Arashort2 (see Methods).After inoculation we collected samples from all the cultures every 1hour, 8 times (so all the cultures lasted 8 hours) + one sample from 0h (to measure fluorescence at the beginning of the culture).We picked some colonies, inoculated them into liquid LB medium and performed plasmid isolation.We found out, that T7 (that should be induced by lactose/IPTG) shows sfGFP expression on a high level on all carbon sources, whilst our promoters are tight.", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "",

made!While many steps within this process are very important in cheese making, the most critical step is the addition of enzymes and bacteria, specifically rennet and lactic acid bacteria, respectively.More importantly, the bacteria are used to ferment the milk by lowering the pH, which ultimately aids in the creation of a product that can actually be cut and molded into what we call cheese.Many different techniques are used to control phage infection, including prevention of phage contamination by routine cleaning of the fermentation areas and rotation of cultures, employment of phage resistant strains of bacteria, and efforts to minimize opportunities for the appearance of new strains of phage.Once all of the unwanted solids have been filtered out of the milk, the milk is placed in troughs where enzymes and bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, are added to create flavor and texture.In the version where the bacteria are able to fight against the infection, a kill switch will cause the bacteria to lyse before the phage is able to fully form, preventing further damage to the culture.In addition, another goal for the USU team is to test the viability of promoters and fluorescent proteins that were designed for lactic acid bacteria in L. lactis.With the rise of molecular biotechnology, it is possible to create new types of phage resistant bacteria.These bacteria will work by using a promoter from the virus itself which will activate when the phage is present.The dairy industry has funded research of this sort to creating phage resistant strains of lactic acid bacteria.The 2015 Utah State University iGEM team is using synthetic biology to create a strain of Lactococcus lactis that is capable of detecting, reporting, and fighting against phage infection, specifically the bacteriophage P335 from the Siphoviridae family.A GFP or RFP that is functional in the L. lactis bacteria will report the presence of phage so that actions can be taken to counteract virus propagation.As said previously, these organisms provide the different textures and flavors to the cheese.At this point, the milk starts to curdle and the curds and whey become differentiated.One notable example is the fermentation of dairy products in order to create cheese and yogurt.Because cheese makers are only interested in the curds, the whey is separated from the curds.Cheese would be very bland if salt was not in the process; therefore, after separation, the curds are milled, where they are broken up into smaller pieces and then salted.", "design": "In this system, transcription and subsequent expression of the fluorescent reporter proteins would only be initiated during ?31 phage infection of L. lactis, from the designed construct within the cell, and allow for qualitative and quantitative detection by observing and measuring fluorescence, respectively.This system is designed to provide an effective defense against ?31 infection of L. lactis industrial dairy fermentations that results in cell death of infected cells and prevents propagation of the ?31 phage, allowing Additionally, this experiment was designed purposefully incorporating the divergent p2001 promoter because of its conservation and high sequence similarity with the other lytic members of the lactococcal P335 species phage.Our designed experiment investigates the use of two ?31 promoters, a divergent promoter (p2001) located within the genetic switch region of the phage genome and a middle promoter (p1997), for detection and a triggered defense system.Making them excellent candidates for use in a detection and defense triggered system.Our ?31 phage detection system was designed utilizing these promoters and the reporter genes superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) and mCherry (a red fluorescent protein, RFP), inserted within the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) expression vector pTRKH2.With the assumption that expression can potentially be induced from this promoter by other lytic members, allowing for broader detection and defense against one of the main phage species that infect and ruin Fluorescent detection of ?31: Upon injection of the ?31 chromosome expression from the p2001 rightward promoter or the p1997 promoter is activated in our designed construct, resulting in production of green fluorescent protein.Triggered defense of ?31: Upon injection of the ?31 chromosome expression from the p2001 rightward promoter or the p1997 promoter is activated in our designed construct, resulting in expression of the three-gene restriction cassette lalR.This detection system provides a rapid detection method that could be implemented within dairy fermentation facilities, allowing for timely monitoring The ?31 phage triggered defense system was designed using the same promoter concept, but with expression of lalR, a three-gene restriction cassette (depicted as a single gene and enzyme for simplicity), after initial phage infection.", "human_practice": "It is of particular importance to our project as it deals with the dairy industry which does allow for the use of microbes in food production but has yet to allow their genetic modification.To date, no genetically engineered starter cultures have been approved for use in the USA by the FDA, and specific criteria for approval has yet to be established [2, 3].USU Video ChallengeElementary, Middle School, and High School Students from the 4 corners area of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico were able learn about iGEM as part of the STEAM Expo, at Utah State University\u0092s Blanding Campus.Research and the accomplishments of former USU iGEM teams were the main attractions, and the scope of the iGEM competition was used to explain the wide development of genetic engineering at high school and undergraduate levels.This event is hosted annually, and is a boon to inspiring young minds to pursue higher education.Because the promoters and all subsequent genetic elements incorporated within this project are of lactococcal origin, it is a reasonable assumption that they should rationally meet the requirements of being considered GRAS, making this a promising model for P335 lytic phage detection and defense in future approved genetically engineered starter cultures [4].Because of the countless foreseeable benefits using genetically engineered starter cultures and the amount of increased potential profits in industrial cheese production, scientist continue research into the area and remain optimistic for future approval [3].Although the world seems to be headed in the direction of accepting genetic engineering, it is apparent that it will be a process that will take many years, continued research on both the potential benefits and safety of the technology, and the development of regulations to help guide its use.But it became clear that having each of these components separately constructed would give us the ability to independently test them and determine if one was a more efficient solution than simply combining them.Equipped with our outreach video, we now have a tool to help engage the public and discuss how genetically modified organisms have the ability to impact and enrich their lives in a positive manner.Those involved in it have the responsibility to ensure that their decisions consider not just the economic benefit of a potential solution but also the moral implications and the health and environmental impact that could arise.The debate on whether this technology can be implemented safely rages especially fiercely in the realm of food production.The technology is a two-edged sword with the ability to save and improve many lives or to place the lives of many into danger, perhaps irreversibly.Attendees traveled hours, some driving by bus from their reservation, and over one thousand participants gathered at the USU Blanding Campus for the two day Expo.Carl specifically noted stages of the process where phage infection becomes a concern, which is where the iGEM project should come in handy: preventing phage from ruining a batch of cheese.After the information session Carl also gave a tour of the facilities and explained the different machines used in the factory.After speaking with industry, the team met together to discuss how this new insight might impact our original set of goals.Carl is very familiar with methods and techniques of the production of cheese.One such standard is the GRAS standard which stands for generally regarded as safe.Building upon previous endeavors such as The Flame Challenge with Alan Alda and the news website Reddit\u0092s ELI5 (Explain Like I\u0092m 5) page, we proposed to solicit other iGEM teams in order to develop videos to explain synthetic biology at its most basic level.The USU iGEM team met with Carl Brotherson, Associate Director of the Western Dairy center to learn more about the cheese-making process.Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a status given by the USDA for allowable food additives.During the meeting Carl explained different types of bacteria used and various methods of creating different types of cheese.A large portion of these students were Native American, exploring their options and interests in the many disciplines of higher education.At this booth, the main topic presented was the application of synthetic biology.From this effort we hope to excite professionals in other scientific fields who can initiate their own informal competitions to open up the black boxes of their field of work and make this knowledge freely available to the public, especially our youth.doi: 10.1016/S0168-1605(02)00238-6Soccol CR, Pandey A, Larroche C (2013) Fermentation Processes Engineering in the

\u00b5L of each culture in three individual wells of a 96-well plate (triplicates of 200 \u00b5L samples).Pipette up and down a few times to mix.Remove the solution to just above the two plates in the first removal pipetting (~1/2 of the volume) and transfer it to the original cell tube (NOT THE DNA TUBE).Add 1 \u00b5L of Ethidium bromide for EACH 10 mL of gel volume (5 \u00b5L for small gel, 20 \u00b5L for large gel).The gel solution can be allowed to cool slightly before pouring into the gel box (pouring boiling solution into gel box can cause it to warp and bend over time).Gently pour the gel into the gel tray by leaning it on the gel box wall farthest from the top comb, and slowly tipping it into the box.Do not leave for longer than 24 hours, as contaminants might have a chance to grow and the plates could dry out.If your cuvette arcs (bright flash and loud popping noise during electroporation):Wash out and sterilize the cuvette with ethanol \u0096 the cells have been pretty much killed and will not be usable in plating, so you need to restart.Glycerol Stocks are one of the best ways to store cells and DNA for long periods of time.CTAB is just above its soluble conditions at normal room temperature, and if the atmospheric pressure is low the day you are extracting DNA, it might come out of solution.Prepare two water baths, one boiling and the other 68C (this can also be accomplished with just the digital waterbath, by bringing the temp to 99/100C, then adding some water to the tank to help it cool down to 68C by the time that water temp is needed)Centrifuge the 12 ml tubes containing the 5 ml cultures in the large centrifuge at 3K RPM for 10 min.NOTE: addition of extra WB or lower amounts of DNA will reduce the time constant as well, so it is only a rough measure.To remove the cells from the cuvette add 1 mL LB media or SOC media (no antibiotic in this media) to the cuvette.Gel purification has the downside of losing some DNA, and reducing overall DNA concentration (a 120 bp band of DNA in a 2000 bp plasmid will only give .06 \u00b5g of DNA if 1 \u00b5g of total DNA digest is added to the lane).Make sure the hinge is away from the center of the rotor, this will make the pellet form on the bottom of the tube on the side of the hinge (it might be hard to see or invisible, so this way you know where it should be)Discard supernatant, rinse pellet in 80% ethanol, and let tubes dry upside down with caps open.Re-suspend DNA in ddH2O (50 uL).Always plan for 1-2 lanes of the DNA ladder (2 especially if this gel will be cut up and DNA removed from it), or another suitable control.For separating larger bands, a 0.7% gel is typically used and the smaller DNA fragments are run completely off the bottom of the gel.Solution should lose all blue color, if not, continue inverting until all blue is gone.Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes (keep the hinge out to get the pellet to form correctly)Using a pipette, remove the supernatant from the tubes, and apply to a labeled blue spin column from the kitPour flow-through BACK into the column and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute 17.This prevents bubbles from forming in the gel, and if they do form, forms them near the bottom of the gel.If additional bubbles form in the gel box, while the gel is still liquid take a pipette tip and push the bubbles to the bottom edge of the gel, where they won\u0092t interfere with DNA movement.Allow gel to cool for 40 minutes to 1 hour.This is usually done using a marker, a characteristic possessed by cells that have the DNA (or lost by those cells) that distinguishes it from the rest of the colonies that grow up.The small gel box supports gels of 50 mL (potentially up to 75 mL, but 50 is easier to use) and the large gel box supports gels of 200 mL.Set up the gel box by removing the gel tray.The large gel box is also capable of having 2 combs at a time (the second placed \u00bd down the box), and so its capacity can double at the cost of distance over which it can separate bands.Once your gel box is selected, determine the concentration of gel you wish to make (see description for details).Buffer EB (supplied in the kit) can also be used.The next day, add 1% overnight culture to 5 mL fresh M17-G, and let it grow for 3-4 hours, until you see light growth when you swirl the tubeThe cleared cultured in then centrifuged and filtered with a 10 mL syringe and 0.45 ?m syringe filter into a sterile tube.There are often special freezing boxes that let the freezing occur more slowly, but for E. coli these are generally not needed.To use the glycerol stock to establish a new culture, either scrape a very small amount of the frozen culture off with a pipette tip and add it to a culture (if it is still frozen), or add 10-20 \u00b5L of the liquid glycerol stock to the culture (if it is somewhat thawed).The DNA is drawn through the gel using an electric current; the negatively charged phosphates on the DNA backbone being attracted toward the cathode (\u0093Run towards red\u0094 is a helpful mnemonic as the cathode is generally red colored).The larger the DNA molecule, the longer it takes to fit through the gaps, making its progress through a gel slower than a small DNA molecule.those with the same fluorescent protein but with different promoters) Transformations are any procedure used to insert DNA into a bacteria (if you use a virus, the term becomes transfection).It is necessary when using higher gel concentrations (and recommended for all other concentrations) that the microwaving occur in 30 second increments, with the solution being stirred by GENTLE rotation (wear protective heat gloves) after each 30 second period, to ensure proper agarose distribution.After microwaving add Ethidium Bromide to the gel solution.Then, tip the cuvette on its side so that the space between the plates is vertical, place the 1000 \u00b5L pipette tip between the plates, and slowly draw up the solution, while tipping the cuvette further.Commonly, this is the expression of an antibiotic resistance gene included on the transformed DNA, which allows only the cells that have taken up the DNA to survive on a plate in the presence of that antibiotic.Test solidification by gently pressing on the bottom corner of the gel with a finger, it should feel solid and gel-like (not liquid).Slide the gel tray into the gel box so that the open ends of the tray are against the box walls, and so that the rubber seals have not rolled up out of their grooves (if the seals moved, return them to their grooves and try sliding the tray in again).Add the correct gel combs to the gel.This helps reduce arcing, although too much can lower numbers of transformed colonies.Transfer the cell/DNA/WB solution into the cuvettes by pipetting up and down in the 1.5 mL tube first to mix.These stocks are prepared so that the cells in the tubes are still alive, and capable of creating new liquid cultures from small amounts of frozen stock.Apply a small amount of water to the inside of the side walls of the gel box and to the ends of the gel tray that have the rubber seals.Cells need to be made competent before doing this procedure, in order for them to efficiently take up the DNA.Add 500 \u00b5L of solution to one plate, spread with the spreading stick, and then spread the spreading stick on the second plate without adding any solution to it.Keep the cuvettes on ice.Before electroporating, dry the cuvettes of with a KimWipe, to ensure no liquid on the surface that could create other paths for the electric pulse (and could cause arcing).Pulse the cells and return cuvette to the ice.Clean and sterilize the electroporation cuvettes by washing with double distilled water (ddH2O) twice and then fill the cuvettes with ethanol.Add 3 \u00b5L of DNA to the cell solution.The small gel combs have two sides (one thinner than the other) the thinner side has about 2/3 of the capacity volume of the thick side (which has the capacities listed in #1), so choose what you need.In a flask that can hold at least 4x your gel\u0092s volume, add the correct volume of 1x TAE buffer.This should draw up the rest of the liquid in the cuvette.Incubate the cell solutions at 37 \u00b0C for 1-2 hours (can go up to three, but try to avoid doing it for that long).Plate the cells on plates containing the correct antibiotic.Example protocol for ligation (to be added to a PCR tube)Add the following reagents to a tube (50 \u00b5l reaction) in the following volumes and order: The thermocyler is setup beforehand

keep them alive, a cryoprotectant is added to the cultures.The concentration is the mass of agarose/mL of gel x 100%.One issue with transformations is selecting and verifying which colonies have the desired DNA.By varying the concentration of the agarose gel, it is also possible to increase the separation of bands of certain sizes on the gel.Have the settings of the centrifuge at 3500 rpm, 25 min, and 4\u00b0C.If they do thaw completely, they can be re-frozen, but repeated thawing may reduce the number of live cells in the stock tube.Make sure the pipette tip is between the metal plates on the cuvette before ejecting the solution.For small band sizes (< 200 bp), it may be necessary to use CIP or TAP dephosphorylation and ligation using the digested DNA solution without gel purification.Determine the number of lanes you wish to run.The main comb for both gels goes into the first notch on the gel tray (should be 1-2 cm from an end), the secondary comb for the large gel is placed in the notch in the middle of the tray.Cyroprotectants function by reducing the freezing point of the solution and act to reduce the formation of large ice crystals inside cells that could rupture membranes.For separating smaller bands, a 2% or 1.5% gel can be used, and run normally.When OD600 reaches between 0.5 and 0.6, take culture out of incubator and place immediately on ice and swirl the contents of the flask to coolStart centrifuging down the cells in the 4x 50mL pre-chilled falcon tubes.Gels are useful for purifying DNA bands of a particular size from restriction digests (to prevent multiple products from forming during ligations) and also for removing proteins from a DNA sample (such as restriction enzymes that are not inactivated by heat).Boil for 45 seconds and centrifuge for 20 min at 13K RPM (or until pellet gets tight).Use a pipette tip to remove the pellet by dragging it (it should be somewhat slimy, but if pelleted well enough, it will hold together), if it doesn\u0092t hold together, re-centrifuge and retry.Centrifuge for 5 min at 13K RPM, discard supernatant, and re-suspend in 300 ul of 1.2 M NaCl by vortexing.Optional Step (but gives better

can directly impact in its properties, resulting in a material with poor electronic and optical applicability.Nowadays, there are two major bottlenecks when talking about production of high quality graphene:First, its mass production, since it is very difficult to produce large amounts of graphene with needed qualities for electrical sectors given that it must have a high conductivity and optical transparency.Secondly, actual methods to synthesize graphene involve the usage of hazardous chemicals, like hydrazine, that generate toxic gases and waste.To address these issues, it is imperative to develop a greener process with an eco-friendly approach, since the demand of this material will increase, and as such, its pollutants if the process is not modified.From all these methods, the chemical reduction is the most likely to be used in mass production given that its disadvantages vary according to the reducing agent Actually, hydrazine is the reducing agent of choice,

sterilising medical equipment to producing ethylene glycol (antifreeze), and as a versatile intermediate for pharmaceutical products, ethylene oxide is essential in many products we use.2 Indeed, in 1992, the world production of ethylene oxide was about 17 x 106 metric tons, and that number has no doubt been increasing.3Traditionally, ethylene oxide has been produced through a chlorohydrin process.Our revised strategy was based on the idea that, by repressing ethene MO expression, we inhibited production of toxic epoxides, enabling robust colonies to grow, which could then better withstand producing large quantities of ethene MO when expression was induced with IPTG.We chose Pseudomonas putida for two major reasons -  If we are successful, Psuedomonas is a good intermediate host between Mycobacterium smegmatis and Escherichia coli.We hypothesised that the minimal expression in Pseudomonas was due to incorrect protein folding and thus our design sought to remedy this.We are focusing on the enzyme ethene Monooxygenase due to its ability to catalyse the ethylene to ethylene oxide reaction.Thus, the Sydney iGEM team is attempting to utilise the monooxygenase enzymes found in Mycobacterium Smegmatis to perform this reaction in a more efficient and safe manner, for a fraction of the cost.Monooxygenase enzymes are capable of performing this epoxide reaction, thus converting alkenes to epoxides safely and efficiently.During the research undertaken to develop the human practices business plan, we reflected on the toxicity of epoxides, the product of ethene MO, to the cells that produce it.This was undertaken as we hypothesised that translation was occurring too frequently, resulting in ribosomal congestion, and thus the rate of the protein s translation was not regulated correctly.Third, we optimised protein folding by adding codon-optimised GroES/GroEL chaperones to encourage correct folding.It was from this we developed our revised hypothesis: because epoxides are toxic to the cell, the enzyme s expression should be controlled to ensure optimal growth of the genetically engineered cells.7 Furthermore, a major disadvantage exists in the lower yield or selectivity of ethylene oxide and the loss of 20-25% of the ethylene to carbon dioxide and water.This repressor binds to the lac operator (within the promoter), which is upstream of ethene MO.8In a time where the demand for ethylene oxide is increasing we simply cannot afford to continue using inefficient, environmentally damaging, and expensive methods of chemical synthesis.Ethene monooxygenase is a member of the group 6 soluble di-iron monooxygenases.This process was replaced by the complete oxidation process, pioneered by Theodore Lefort in 1931.4 Since the production of ethylene oxide, chemists have successfully synthesised other epoxides including propylene oxide.In 1859 the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz first chemically synthesised ethylene oxide (also known as oxirane) from ethylene chlorohydrin and aqueous potassium hydroxide, unlocking a compound that has been extensively utilized in the pharmaceutical, medical, and manufacturing industry.This was the major modelling component of our project and more information can be found on the modelling page.Second, we optimised translation through adding weak ribosome binding sites.As our ethene MO was cloned into pBBR, it was under the control of the lac operon regulatory system.9Previous work in the Coleman Laboratory showed Pseudomonas putida can express low levels of wild-type ethene monooxygenase.During this experiment, we were unable to attain expression of the codon-optimised GroES/EL chaperonins.Consequently, the team is attempting to achieve high levels of expression in Pseudomonas Putida.Because of this, the lacI repression system was able to be adopted as a method of controlling the expression of ethene MO.Thus, the conditions must be tightly controlled to ensure maximum selectivity, making this a high-maintenance process.LacI is inhibited by addition of a compound, IPTG, thus by adding IPTG, repression of ethene MO expression is released.9 Ly MA, 2014, Evaluation of components for the heterologous expression of Mycobacterium chubuense NBB4 monoxygenases.These enzymes are characterised by the following arrangement of subunits: a coupling protein and a reductase, as well 4 subunits in (??)2 configuration.The silver catalyst is highly selective and thus ages quickly, the reaction requires incredibly pure oxygen (99% or greater), and toxic by-products such as formaldehyde are generated.Epoxides are incredibly versatile due to the addition of the oxygen atom on the tetrahedral ring making the compound strained and unstable.Escherichia coli is a more suitable host as it is easier to work with and scale up to create a commercially viable product (see here).1 American Chemistry Council, What is Ethylene Oxide?, 2015, ACC, USA, Accessed 20th of July 2015,

deposit produced chemicals directly into the surrounding broth.5 This is the approach planned for MycoMimic s implementation, and thus some of the enabling technologies may already exist, particularly since we intend to achieve final expression in e. coli, which already finds extensive use in industry.It is imperative MycoMimic is closely monitored when it is scaled up to an industry level: Ethylene oxide is a highly flammable and reactive compound.Figure 5 - SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of MycoMimic.By considering our SWOT analysis (particularly the weaknesses identified), throughout project we made proactive changes to improve MycoMimic:To address the identified weakness of toxicity due to excessively high levels of protein production, we co-expressed the operon LacI which will stop the production of ethylene oxide before these levels are reached.To take advantage of the opportunity identified for governmental support, we engaged with the New South Wales state government, in return receiving funding for part of our project (see Attributions).To investigate the challenges and possibilities of scaling up production of MycoMimic, we discussed what would be involved, and what this might require, with a number of our sponsoring BioTechnology firms (see Attributions).We believe this is important as it creates competition in the market, which will lead to a more diverse and fair environment.Based on lessons learned from prior implementations of bacterial synthesis procedures in industry, to bring MycoMimic into action as a substantive source of ethylene oxide we would require development of industrial plants on a large scale.This venture draws many parallels with our own, and thus serves as a case study from which we can learn.5Prior to the application of bacterial synthesis Insulin was, much like ethylene oxide, produced by an inefficient and environmentally degrading method.Consequently the ring can be easily opened up, releasing abundant amounts of energy that can be used in further reactions, such as nucleophilic addition, hydrolysis, and reduction.Over time the production processes for ethylene oxide have evolved, incrementally improving efficiency and reducing waste.3 This has demonstrated a chemical industry happy and willing to embrace change to improve their environmental impact, even if on occasion it is to the detriment of their bottom line.Studying these problems from a business perspective provided influential insight into our iGEM project, and indeed the entire concept of our project is a direct result of the volatile, finite, and environmentally damaging methods of ethylene oxide production that are ubiquitous at present.Due to the abundant use and versatility of ethylene oxide it is evident this compound is at present essential to our society: Thus, it is imperative we find a new avenue for production of this critical substance in an environmentally friendly and cost efficient manner.Thus, we believe that if we can develop an economically-feasible product we will be able to make a strong case for its replacement of contemporary processes.In Figure 2 the advantages and disadvantages of current methods of production are compared: Based on the numerous disadvantages of the complete oxidation process, which we believe far outweigh the advantages, it is evident a new, clean, green process needs to be created and implemented on an industrial scale.However, at present the production method of ethylene oxide is environmentally detrimental, expensive, and uses non-renewable resources as its reagents.1 A major focus of governments, industries, companies, and universities over the last few decades has been the creation of a more sustainable future.By sharing details of our business plans, particularly how they can lessen the environmental impact of industrial processes, we were able to garner considerable interest, and help to allay common (but often misinformed) fears held by the public.By identifying opportunities for expansion of our methodology to biological synthesis of other chemicals, our business plan played an important part in motivating our modelling research: Since many hurdles will need to be overcome with each synthesis pathway developed in the future, we designed adaptable tools for codon optimisation.Bacterial production of ethylene oxide is a significantly better alternative to traditional chemical synthesis.Ethylene oxide, one of the most abundantly produced chemical compounds, is derived from ethylene via an oxidation process.As outlined, MycoMimic has the potential to be an incredibly effective, versatile, and necessary product in a time when the world is striving to improve environmentally sustainability.Therefore, perhaps the greatest risk facing MycoMimic is a failure to become economically viable: If we cannot demonstrate a process which at least has the potential to be economically scaled up, it will be all but impossible for our new technology to be implemented on any meaningful scale.The only requirements for this product are the bacteria MycoMimic itself and a source of ethylene.Secondly, the reduced barrier-to-entry and comparative ease of production provided by MycoMimic creates a more accessible market, preventing monopolies from forming in which the control of this important compound might fall into the hands of a few.Encouraged by these discussions we set expression in e. coli as the eventual aim of our project, since this is the most common and effective host for production on industrial scales.As public concern and opposition plays a major part in all Synthetic Biological ventures, we were able to tailor our approach to Human Practices to address this.In addition, through our research, we discovered that the amount of ethylene oxide a single cell had to produce in order to be a more efficient alternative than the current method of production would be toxic to the cell.Consequently, in a time where the demand for ethylene oxide is increasing we simply cannot afford to continue using inefficient, environmentally damaging, and expensive methods of chemical synthesis.Image from 5Though MycoMimic hopes to break new ground in industrial synthesis, the application of bacteria for large-volume chemical synthesis of chemicals is not without precedent: One of the early breakthroughs in this field came in the development of an e. coli strain able to produce Insulin.Many aspects of our project were motivated by consideration from a business perspective, which revealed the range of interlinked challenges faced in the implementation of synthetic biological technologies.Moving forwards after MycoMimic, much of our work has been completed with the necessity for future industry implementation in mind: by developing adaptive tools and methodologies, and by improving public understanding of these technologies, we hope that we have helped to invigorate a market more receptive to synthetic biological solutions to everyday problems.Our project has a very viable \"real world application\", and thus we created a Business Model and plan for the transition from laboratory experiment to a feasible product.Similar safety checkpoints will be necessary in any ethylene oxide synthesis process: Via their inclusion the risk of any physical threats (such as explosion of synthesised products) can be monitored, and financial and time costs due to errors in production may be minimised.Furthermore, in the case of ethylene oxide competition can also arise in the form of new methods for production, such as that current used for crude oil.Figure 2 - The advantage and disadvantages of production of ethylene oxide through the complete oxidation process.Without the means to break through the cellular membrane the Insulin accumulates inside the body of each bacterium, and thus maximal production is reached within the span of a few hours.Its aim was to demonstrate the capacity and the MycoMimic project has to be applied to the real world and developed into a working product.Aside from the core industrial processes involved, many aspects of bacterial Insulin production may provide important lessons for our project.By continuing to promote the research and development of biological synthesis pathways we believe that even if MycoMimic does not achieve this economic feasibility, we will have taken important strides in laying the groundwork for similar technologies to be implemented in the future.Similar obstacles have plagued innumerable past ventures, which can be seen in the plethora of biological solutions to important environmental problems that are unfortunately stalled by a lack of economic feasibility.Thus we needed to create a mechanism in which the expression could be cellularly monitored and repressed when the production of ethylene oxide nears the \"danger zone\".Our case study serves to illustrate another major technical challenge of MycoMimic s application on an industrial scale, which is that development of the necessary logistical and regulatory framework can provide a substantial challenge outside of the biological context.It is therefore necessary to firstly establish the different views on this issue held throughout the community, and secondly to explain or market the product so that the consumers understand the benefits of MycoMimic, both to themselves and the environment.Furthermore, numerous environmental and sustainability organisations, including the United Nations Environmental Program, have highlighted the need for greener and more sustainable alternative procedures for production of common chemical compounds.We believe that the product developed in our project can significantly assist in decreasing carbon emissions and in creating a more sustainable future for all.With each such venture new research spotlights and studies the financial barriers in this field, and as we incrementally push these forwards we will see greater numbers of possibilities for the implementation of synthetic biology in industry emerge.Typically, synthesis is performed simultaneously by a large array of fermentation tanks, though the mechanisms of this process differ widely depending on the circumstance.The \u0093EtnA\u0094 \u0093EtnB\u0094, \u0093EtnC\u0094, and \u0093EtnD\u0094 are the four subunits of the enzyme.Given MycoMimic is an easy product to work with, it can be used on both large and small scales.With the insertion and successful expression of this enzyme, the bacterium can produce ethylene oxide.The world production of ethylene oxide is (17\times10^6) metric tons2 and will only increase on the back of the expanding economies of countries such as China and India.Once this reaches maximal capacity it is time to begin production, which is kick-started by the addition of an inducer to the broth.Though other processes have pioneered the implementation of genetically modified organisms for industrial synthesis, the community reaction to this pivot may present a risk.The purpose of this report is to provide an analysis of the development and commercial economic viability and likelihood of the MycoMimic product.This involved the processing of huge volumes of pig pancreases, with more than 8 tons necessary for the production of each kilogram of purified insulin.5 Due to this inefficiency researchers sought, as we do with MycoMimic, an alternative production pathway.Our project aims to produce ethylene oxide in a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and timely manner.When working with it on a small scale in the laboratory, it poses minimal and controllable threats.The processes these early pioneers developed inspired those used in our project: Antibiotic resistance is utilised to select out appropriate e. coli strains, which are then left to reproduce in an incubator over the course of some days.Thus, going forward it is essential that consumers are well informed (as we have aimed to do with our Human Practices project), such that they can make scientifically sound judgements upon these issues which play increasingly important parts in their lives.A SWOT analysis is used to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of this project.In the business implementation process these risks can include failing to manage cost restraints and changes, and can quickly balloon when unforeseen complications arise.However, in the long-term, the financial advantages of MycoMimic are greater, as too are its prospects for minimisation of environmental impact.Building upon this analysis we can proactively plan an effective strategy that will focus on the strengths of this product while catering for weaknesses and possible threats.This lead directly to the inclusion of the LacI in our project, which became one of the submitted parts.For example, it would not be entirely unexpected that objections might be raised against the idea of engineered organisms producing highly explosive compounds.In Australia, as one of the most economically prosperous nations in the Asia-Pacific region, great effort needs to be undertaken to ensure the financial aspect of the product is under control.Though the need for logistical development is a mainstay in almost all industrial synthesis, as MycoMimic departs considerably from many existing synthesis procedures this will likely provide a major challenge.In the short term, competition from oil-companies may prove to be a risk.Over the following years chemists have successfully synthesised other epoxides including propylene oxide.Data from 4Traditionally, ethylene oxide was been produced through a chlorohydrin process.This eventuated in the late 1970s, when after much research and development scientists finally demonstrated the ability to express a gene in e. coli which enabled it to produce human-viable insulin.1 United States Environmental Protection Agency, 1986, Locating and estimating air emission from sources of ethylene oxide, viewed 20th of July 2015,

effective time management was critical in helping us balance university, iGEM, work, and everything else.Harry & Matt discussed this possibility, along with potential areas for improvement.Started to brainstorm ideas for a human practices project and outreach activitiesAfter continued research over the weekend, met with academic staff in the department to discuss sensible mechanisms that should be included in simulating, and potentially optimising, translation.Continued research, focusing on the work of Brakley et al, as well as different aspects of our organisms of interest (and how they compare to yeast).Started designing the G-Blocks for order and began creating electrocompetent cells and various agar platesEvery day in the lab we would begin by asking ourselves what needed to be done that day and in what order.Meet up for the first time and were intrdouced to the project.\"Progress is made by trial and failure; the failures are generally a hundred times more numerous than the successes\u00a0; yet they are usually left unchronicled\"This was not the case for our team as we sought to extensively chronicle all the successes and failures.This allowed us to work faster and more efficient, it also created an easy transition between the different lab members as one member could pick up where the other left off without having to chase them down to find out the important information about the past experiment.", "protocol": "Stand the column for 2-3 minutes and centrifuge at full speed fro 1-2 minutes to elute DNA The miniprep was performed using the Bioline ISOLATE

short overlaps at the restriction sites.Add 5 \u00b5L of appropriate 10x buffer to a microcentrifuge tube.Set up thermocycler to cycle between 16 C (1 minute) and 37 C (1 minute) for 30-35 times  After the termination of heat cycle, incubate sample at each 50 C and 80 C for 5 minutes Note: Assign volumes of insert and vector such that to avoid total volume of more 15 uL.Refer to NEB Golden Gate Assembly or Sydney iGEM Golden Gate explainer for further information on GGA method and design.Transformation is a technique by which DNA may be inserted into competent cells.For instance, centrifuge the tubes, pour off supernatant, resuspend cells in the final drop remaining in the tube and spread-plate the last 100 \u00b5L of cells.Psudomonas electrocompetent cells are used for transformation of plasmid with or without the gene of interest by electroporation.The system is based on binding up to 20\u00b5g DNA to a silica-based membrane in chaotrophic salts with average recoveries of 60 to 90%.Use a clean, sharp scalpel or razor blade to excise the gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest Measure the weight of the gel slice (about 50-200mg) and place it into a sterile 1.5ml or 2ml centrifuge tube.The following protocol is readily tweaked depending on the specifics of the template DNA, primers and polymerase of choice.PCR of multiple samples is sped up significantly by making a master mix; the volumes below are for one 50 \u00b5L reaction, but the volumes would be multiplied by the number of reactions required and mixed together in a single tube.Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes (49 \u00b5L) then add 1 \u00b5L of the template DNA.Add 500uL of 1:1 (triethylamine: acetone) and observe for colour change and measure OD600 with deionized water as blank.Mix 10 g Tryptone, 5 g Yeast extract, 5 g NaCl and 1 L of water, or use the same ratio in the required volume.Antibiotics can be added to make the media selective for antibiotic resistant cells.(Note: 10%Glycerol can be used as electroporation buffer for Pseudomonas putida) After centrifugation, resuspend pellet in 5mL cold electroporation buffer and place on ice.Competent bacterial cells are used for transformation of plasmids to allow propagation of plasmids and for expression of the genes of interest.Split DNA prep into 4 equally sized aliquots (~400 \u00b5l each) Precipitate DNA by adding 1/10-volume 3M Na-acetate (~40 \u00b5l) to each tube, and then add 2 volumes cold ethanol (~1 ml).Alternatively, if performing a colony PCR, aliquot 50 \u00b5L of master mix into a tube and resuspend cells directly from the plate into the tube.It relies on the fact that DNA is negatively charged, and that a uniform electric field can be applied across the semi-permeable agarose gel.Once dispensed, collect all tubes and store in -80\u00b0C freezer.Electroporation, or electropermeabilization, is a molecular biology technique in which an electrical field is applied to cells in order to increase the permeability of the cell membrane, to allow DNA of interest to be introduced into electrocompetent Pseudomanas cells.Add all the mixture from step 1 into the column Was the column once with o.5ml WN Buffer by centrifuging for 30 \u0096 60 seconds.The ligation reaction is quite flexible, and the following protocol can be applied to general ligations, as long as care is taken to maintain a ~3:1 molar ratio of insert:vector, and that the total DNA concentration does not exceed 10 ng/\u00b5l.The introduced DNA will often contain a marker gene (usually antibiotic resistance) so that successfully transformed cells can be grown on selective media (normally an antibiotic), which corresponds to the marker gene.The buffer choice depends on the restriction enzyme used and can be checked from readily available tables.Add restriction enzyme; 10 U activity is sufficient, which is normally the activity of 1 \u00b5L restriction enzyme solution.Once set remove the comb, tape/end formers and place into electrophoresis chamber and submerge in TBE.The Polymerase Chain Reaction is used to amplify segments of DNA to high concentrations as a screen for the presence of the target or for further manipulation.DNA can be stored at -20\u00b0CPipet 10-100\u00b5l of PCR product or DNA solution after enzymatic reaction to a new 1.5ml centrifuge tube.This is only possible if the enzymes have compatible reaction buffers and optimal temperatures; if they do not, then you must perform two sequential digests with a purification step in betweenLigase facilitates binding between complementary sequences of DNA.Invert the tube every 1-2 minutes during incubation Place a GPTM Column onto a Collection Tube and load no more than 0.6ml dissolved gel mixture into the column.After incubating, plate the cultures on appropriate selective media plates in 100uL aliquots and as resuspended whole pellet.Grow the appropriate host by inoculating LB culture with the culture and incubating it while shakingAlso, the same protocol can be followed by other inducers such as tetracycline (in low amounts) instead of using IPTG, however, the concentration in the inducing sample may be different.NBP or 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridine assay is used to evaluate ethene monoxygenase activity.Aseptically inoculate 100 mL LB in 500 mL Schott Bottle with enough culture to obtain OD600 of

samples, heat inactivated digestion samples can be used for the ligation.This kit purifies fragments of DNA (100bp \u0096 10-kb) from agrose gel or other reactions with enzymes, dNTPs, salts and primers without the need for the phenol/chloroform extraction.VIOGENE)Combine on ice 2 \u00b5L of NEB 10X T4 ligase buffer, 8.5 \u00b5L purified insert, 8.5 \u00b5L of purified vector, and 1 \u00b5L

Eppi tube.Cycles must have a peak high enough to denature template DNA, a trough low enough to allow annealing of primer pair, followed by an intermediate stage for the optimal polymerase activity.Restriction digestion employs restriction enzymes which recognise specific sites in a DNA sequence and will cut the strands at those sites.Add 15-30\u00b5l of Elution Buffer onto the center of the membrane.Spin at top speed (4000 rpm) in Centaur centrifuge (doesn\u0092t need to be cold) for 15 min, pour off supernatant, keep pellet.Redissolve pellet in 2 mL TE with mixing (tapping tube ~ 1 min , don\u0092t vortex too much from this point onward).In this case, make sure that:Golden Gate Assembly (GGA) is used for cloning one or more inserts into a vector by designing overlapping ends which can join desired DNA together after cleavage by non-palindromic restriction enzyme, BsaI, followed by ligation to seal the DNA together.Incubate tubes for 1 hour on the 37\u00b0C shakers.The restriction enzyme volume should not be more than 1/10 of the total reaction volume.Incubate for an hour at the optimal temperature for restriction enzyme activity; again, this should be checked from relevant data tables.Restriction digests with two enzymes simultaneously are also possible and were performed over the course of the project.Add 0.5ml GP Buffer and mix well Place a GPTM Column onto a Collection Tube.Alternatively, the cells can be diluted or concentrated before plating.This involves the same protocol as above except that the reaction mixture is made up to 48 \u00b5L in step 3.Add

buffer, combine resuspended pellets in one tube.If using end formers, seal the ends by pipetting a small volume of gel solution into the contact between the end formers and tank and allow to set.Spin 15 min in Centaur centrifuge (doesn\u0092t need to be cold).Centrifuge the column at full speed for another 3 minutes or more to remove the residual ethanol.Place the column onto a new 1.5ml centrifuge tube.Add 1uL of appropriate purified plasmid for positive control; 2~3uL of ligation mix for test; and no DNA for negative control.Heat shock transformation uses a rapid change in temperature to cause plasmids to enter cells via pores in the membrane.Spin for 10 min, drain off supernatant, rinse pellet with 70% ethanol (as above, but using 500 \u00b5l 70% EtOH), drain excess EtOH off, then dry 10 min at 50\u00b0C.Add 8 mL lysis solution (SDS-OH), mix well by inversion and shaking(~10 sec).Resuspend the pellet in 30mL cold electroporation buffer and centrifuge at top speed (~4500rpm or ~3000g) for 15mins at 4\u00b0C.Depending on the tank, use masking tape or end-formers to seal the two ends of the gel tray.Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds and discard the flow-through.Wash the column once with 0.5ml of WN Buffer by centrifuging for 30-60 seconds.Repeat solvent extractions using 500 \u00b5l chloroform:isoamyl (CI, \u00b5l) per tube, as described for PCI above.This must be added after autoclaving.Working with DNA often involves adding enzymes (polymerases, restriction enzymes, ligases), which may subsequently need to be removed before they prevent or contaminate the next stage of work.Ligation allows fragments of DNA with sticky ends to be joined together, but the enzymes also has other uses like in Gibson Assembly.In \"Exponential\" protocol on the electroporator, change the settings to 2500 V, 25 \u00b5F, and 200 ?.Avoid the white junk at the interface between phases.Spread-plate 100 \u00b5L of cells on LB media containing the appropriate antibiotic.Also consult the instruction booklet that comes with the Viogene kit \u0096 the protocol below only gives the bare essentials required.Add 6 mL ice-cold precipitation solution (K.Ac).Ligase is not thermostable, so there is an efficiency trade-off between increasing the rate of ligation and the rate of ligase degradation at higher temperatures.Prepare fresh from separate stocks (NaOH \u0096 2 M, Autoclaved\u00a0; SDS \u0096 10%) Precipitation sol\u0092n (solution III): 3 M potassium, 5 M acetate, pH 4.8.Gel electrophoresis is used to separate DNA based on their size and mobility through agarose.Pellet 100 mL culture in 2 x 50 mL Falcon tubes.(Only dip the toothpick 3-5 times in the master mix).Start the thermocycler at the setting desired.", "result": "", "safety": "Although antibiotic resistance genes were used as selectable markers in many of our constructs, it is unlikely that these genes would allow for pathogenicity in the lab strains of E. coli and P. putids that were used.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?None of the parts we created encode virulence factors or toxins known to be a threat to human or animal health, which was confirmed by BLAST searches of each of the sequences.Hand washing was conducted when entering or leaving the lab, and aseptic techniques were adhered to when working with microorganisms.Additionally, we ensured that none of the genes or parts that we were assembling would act as virulence factors, and that no known pathogens would be involved in our research, with our research plan cleared with the University of Sydney Biosafety Committee.The location of the fire escapes, and evacuation area, along with the details of the First Aid Officers.As we were working in a Physical Containment Level 2 Laboratory (PC-2), additional training was required specific to our project.Furthermore, we ensured none of the genes (both whole and fragmentary) would act as virulence factors, and that no known pathogens would be involved in our research.The School of Molecular Bioscience also has a set of well-documented standard operating procedures.All training and work was undertaken in accordance with the Australian Standard For Safety in Laboratories - Microbiology (AS/NZS 2243.3:2010), for GMO specific regulations we followed the Guidelines established by the Australian Gene Technology Act (2000), and the Sydney University Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).This was done by conducting our research in a physical containment 2 (PC-2, equivalent to BSL-2) lab, where all biological material was autoclaved before disposal, to prevent release of these recombinant organisms into the environment.Although antibiotic resistance genes were used as selectable markers in many of our constructs, it is unlikely that these genes would allow for pathogenicity in the bacterial lab strains that were used.In order for our group to be allowed to work in the laboratory, we had to go through extensive safety training both online and practical.None of the parts we created encode virulence factors or toxins known to be a threat to human or animal health, which was confirmed by BLAST searches of each of the sequences.This included:Extensive knowledge of the chemicals used, safety equipment required in their use (such as the Fumehood) and, correct methods of disposal, along with the online and physical location of MSDS sheets.No parts had sequences sourced from known human or animal pathogens.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?Despite exclusively using non-pathogenic laboratory strains of bacteria, our team endeavoured to further reduce the risk of handling the recombinant microorganisms that we made.Our project was covered by previous applications to the IBC and work was undertaken in accordance with the School of Molecular Bioscience standard

"background": "", "description": "This protein, which is encoded by the nuclear MRPS12 gene (systematic name, YNR036C) is essential for the function of mitochondrial ribosomes and the synthesis of key components of the electron transport chain, without which, aerobic respiration is not possible.To test our idea, we modified the popular yeast expression vector, p416-GPD (M\u00fcller 120), by replacing the multiple cloning site with the BioBrick prefix and suffix (pSB416-GPD).However, a copper chelator like bathocuprione disulfonate could then be added to the system, to derepress the MRPS12 gene and allow aerobic respiration to begin again.Such a system could be employed during industrial fermentations.By disabling aerobic respiration, the yeast could begin generating secondary metabolites sooner and, therefore, might produce more over the course of their growth.We propose that the production of fermentation products and secondary metabolites could be optimized by purposefully regulating aerobic respiration during industrial fermentations.Additionally, if fermentation products could be consumed by the yeast, such a switch could prevent this consumption to increase yields (Aerts 115).We then used overlap assembly to clone a new translational unit (BBa_K1729001), including the wild-type Kozak sequence and a yeast codon-optimized MRPS12 gene, behind the GPD promoter.Ultimately, we envision controlling the expression of this gene with a repressible promoter such as that of the CTR1/3 system (Labbe 149).Therefore, when a higher concentration of copper is added to a culture, MRPS12 will not be expressed and aerobic respiration will not occur, forcing the cells into fermentative growth.", "design": "In order to avoid any potential conflicts, we started looking into new promoter systems that could potentially be used in our project.Our team found three new potential promoter systems that may be used in the project: MET-25, FET-3, and FIG-1.Created mini-preps and ran gels for a number of colonies, worked on project description.Week 5 This week focused on researching how our system could be used in industry and the details of the CTR-1 copper-repressible promoter system functions.Wrote the project description for the wiki and the iGem deadline, reviewed work left to do after week off.The team completed the project description and placed it on our wiki.Each promoter system was then discussed and thrown out due to issues with potential ligands needed to activate the systems and lack of information available that would prevent implementation.Upon continuing review, the team found a new promising promoter system using copper.In addition to the mRPS12 ORF construct, our team also designed and ordered a transcriptional unit to submit to the registry as a new part (construct 2 optimized).With this system, we would also need to utilize a construct consisting of a constitutive promoter (perhaps ADH1) and the TetR-VP64A coding region in order to produce the regulatory element (TetR-VP64A) required for the operator.We also started ideas for graphics that would be good to have on our presentation.Week 9 This week s design work focused on the presentation and poster, as well as discussing documentation for part submisson.We continued work on poster and presentation.Week 6This week focused on the documentation of the project (poster, presentation, and potential papers) and learning more about repressible promoter systems.Discussion on how to design the copper repressor began.Planned out experiment for cell number standard curves.The team discussed site directed mutigenesis for removing illgeal PstI site and removing a premature atg in our vector at the cleavage of the GPD promoter and the translation unit.The team ordered primers for the mutagenesis discussed on 8/4/15, discussed how to submit parts, and which parts go where, and how to document them.We started designing poster for giant Jamboree.The team discussed the creation of a new part, a modified version of the p416 plasmid which would be biobrick compatible and would be used in our experiments with our created translational unit.Discussions were conducted regarding how the experiments could be carried out and possible modeling that could be done.The team discussed possible papers to review for modeling yeast ethanol production with Dr. Goulet and read the user manual for the fluorescence reader for the ethanol assays.Week 7This week focused on learning about ethanol assays and how to use the fluorescence plate reader.We began working with the fluorescence plate reader in the Myers lab on campus.Additionally, we began consulting the literature to delineate the mechanism by which Mac1 protein interacts with the promoter.The team planned for our human practices project with the middle schoolers.We also began thinking about how we could analyze our data.Week 8This week focused on site-directed mutagenesis, the poster, and presentation for the Giant Jamboree.Sent off a set of DNA for sequencing.We decided on a project, set goals, and started designing parts.Our team spent time discussing project ideas, establishing the overall goal to create an on/off \u0093switch\u0094 for the mitochondria in S. cerevisiae.Additionally, this motif suggests that it is cleaved off in a two step cleavage event by mitochondrial processing peptidase and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase.The team conducted a literature review to understand the genes encoded by the mitochondrial DNA in order to assess which proteins would no longer be translated as a result of the inactivation of mrps12.From the literature review, we found that some components of the electron transport chain and proteins involved in the krebs cycle would no longer be translated due to this inactivation.We decided to continue research into this system as it is the most promising we have found.Week 3 This week s focus was the Human Practices portion of our project.Additionally, the team began to plan out the experiments for our ethanol assays.Upon further looking into the tet-o system we found that there may have been potential copyright issues with using a tet-o system for our project.We discussed track selection further and began discussing, in depth, the roles our project may play in a manufacturing setting.This system will be used to explain the basic components in a general sense to the group before having them delve into the more advanced challenges.Today the team had its synthetic biology education seminar with the middle schoolers.We started to review the content written for the poster and plan the graphics that will accompany/replace the text currently there.The team further discussed the protocol and necessary lab work for the ethanol assays which we will be conducting.We are still unsure of what assembly method to use to create this modified plasmid.Our team started today by having a meeting to establish what needed to be finished for the week\u0092s end, as well as goals for the following week.The team then switched gears and wrote up our summary of our human practices events from the previous week as well as wrote a preliminary draft of our project description.Overall, the meeting was incredibly helpful in seeing the larger process to which our system fits and how our system may affect various aspects of that process.Begun work on building the copper repressor part by assembling in silico the sequence for CTR1p with +/- 1kb up or downstream of the ORF as found on SGD.Today our team began discussing methods for visualizing yeast mitochondria as well as methods for comparing the mitochondria between the on and off states.Each group was able to complete the challenges in a reasonable amount of time and were able to explain the purpose of each part in the biological circuit that they had constructed.Week 4This week revolved around researching leader sequences and how regulating MRPS12 might affect growth and production of fermentation products.It was also realized that the MRPS12 ORF part order previously (construct 1) was designed with the prefix for non-coding regions rather than the prefix for coding regions, and must be reordered with the correct prefix sequence.Lastly, we found that a base concentration of 16nM of copper is necessary for the function of the promoter and the repression occurs around a copper concentration of 1\u00b5M.started idea on a potential model, which would be related to the amount of copper needed to activate/deactivate gene.We learned of various products that the general idea of our system may be used, including, ethanol, vanillin, indigo, etc.The team created a first draft of the written content for the introduction, application, and human resources portions of the poster.Began work on the presentation at the Giant Jamboree, including an outline of content as well as rough drafts of diagrams.There are three possible promoters to use the two repressible CTR1 and CTR3 promoters and the inducible CUP1 promoter.We discussed an outline for our parts documentation and submission status to the registry.We looked into the equipment that would be needed for our ethanol assays.This part will be used as our new BioBrick part for the second silver medal requirement.al (1997) as the CTR1 promoter as well as the CuRE transcript elements within this region were also identified.The activation of the system involves a binding event between the CuREs, Mac1 protein, and copper.Today\u0092s focus was on the background biology and considering how much of it was needed for the jamboree, considering the significant biological background that attendees will have.We continued work on poster and presentation.This system would be regulated using varying sugars in the media.CTR3 was reintroduced as a possibility after concern over a transposon in the wild type CTR3 promoter was dismissed.Thus, we chose to proceed with the CTR1 promoter.We also discussed Kozak sequences and determined that the Kozak sequence listed on the registry on the yeast page is actually the mammalian sequence.We planned and held three seminars for middle school summer campers on campus.We decided on continuing our examination of literature about the CTR1 and CTR3 promoter systems.We also selected information sections that would be put onto the poster.Work continued on the poster and graphics.The team typed up preliminary drafts for the documentation of the parts which we will be submitting to the iGEM parts database.The safety page for the wiki was written by the team.This part consists of the optimized mRPS12 ORF following the native Kozak sequence.A 64bp region in the promoter region of the CTR3 gene was identified as the minimally required loci for the promoter to respond to copper input and function correctly.This composite part was also flanked by 30 nucleotide overhangs homologous to the registry\u0092s prefix and suffix.Secondary metabolites is a significant portion that we wanted to address, since production of the metabolites are the primary use of fermentation in industry.We were able to find the user manual for the machine and the software user manual allowing us to gain an understanding of how to use the machine for our experiments.The proteins involved in entry are mitochondrial peptidases for cleaving the signal peptidase after entry and various TIM and TOM proteins that mediate entry.We compared the four cleavage motifs for mitochondrial peptidases with our sequence and matched our leader sequence with the R-10 cleavage motif.Lastly, our team discussed possibilities for promoters that could be used for our translational unit and concluded that a tetracycline operator system (TetO) could be useful for regulation of our construct.The first will be composed of the wild type mRPS12 sequence, preceded by the native Kozak sequence.We plan on introducing them to synthetic biology and the idea of how genes are turned into proteins.We brainstormed potential questions from judges about any information thus far selected.Prepared for the creation of the mitochondrial localization sequence for submission to the database.The TET system was investigated by our team as a potential candidate for an on/off switch.The mRPS12 ORF was then flanked by 30 nucleotide overhangs homologous to the prefix and suffix listed in the registry to allow for insertion into pSB1C3 via homologous recombination.Primary discussion revolved around color scheme and graphics for the poster.The R-10 motif suggests that localization of mrps12 would occur in either the inner mitochondrial matrix or the mitochondrial matrix.We began discussing possibilities for parts submissions, including the ORF for mRPS12, a promoter, and a reporter.The students enjoyed the presentation and activity and were extremely interested in learning about synthetic biology and the field of biology in general.In order to assess the application of our product more effectively we decided to meet with other faculty at Rose-Hulman with experience in industry using yeast for industrial processes.Team arranged meeting with Dr. Serbezov to understand the industrial roles of yeast more effectively.The team met with Dr. Serbezov and, an incoming professor, Dr. Reizman in order to discuss the manufacturing application of our system.Week 2 This week was primarily focused on finding a system to act as a  switch  to turn the gene on and off.We also began planning out new partsThe team began a literature review regarding leader sequences and their function for mrps12.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Also, single colonies of BY4742 and ? disrupted strain were picked and smeared on a fresh YPD plate to use to inoculate 5 ml cultures tomorrow that will be used for yeast transformations on Friday.Overnight cultures were

pSB416-GPD sample 1B to compare.Also, ran a lamp glass gel on digested p416 from yesterday to make sure it was cut, which was confirmed.Today, we performed boiling preps on NB1, LA3, LB2, and pSB416 cultures from overnight.The resulting gel was messy due to star activity of PvuII, so the minipreps were then digested with PstI to run on a gel tomorrow to estimate concentrations in order to send off samples for sequencing.Week 7Highlight: pSB1C3/translational unit construct sequencing came back correct for one sample.Sample 1B of pSB416 was digested with SpeI, and used with T.U.Colonies were found on five of the twelve plates from yesterday, and colonies were picked to start 3 mL overnight cultures (8 from 4A, 2 from 5A, 5 from 5B, 7 from 6A, and 10 from 6B) for boiling preps.A gel was run on SpeI digested NB1, LA3, and LB2 and affirmed that we have the correct plasmid.Then, boiling preps were digested with PvuII and SpeI and run on a gel, expecting bands at 4450, 931, and 879.All 6 pSB416 digests resulted in bands of the correct sizes, and the remaining liquid cultures of these were used for a miniprep to be sent off for sequencing.The preps were then digested with XbaI and PvuII and run on a gel, expecting correct bands at 4450, 879, and 931.We also replated pSB416-GPD/A and pSB416-GPD/A+MRPS12Today, we picked 6 colonies from each of the Q5 transformation plates and started overnight cultures, also picked one colony each from pSB416-GPD/A and pSB416-GPD/A+MRPS12 to start overnight cultures.Only pSB416-GPD/A culture grew, so we did a boiling prep on that and stored some in glycerol stock.Four preps (1A, 2A, 2B, and 4A) returned positive results and the remaining liquid cultures of these four were used for minipreps.The four returned positive results again and will be used tomorrow for a yeast transformation.Today, we transformed yeast with pSB416-GPD (2A) and pSB416-GPD-S12 (2A) following the protocol for yeast transformation from the Breeden lab.These should show growth by Thursday and will tell us whether or not our translational unit was able to restore function to the strains with their endogenous copy of MRPS12 disrupted.Today, 5 mL cultures of YPD were inoculated with BY4742 for transformation tomorrow.BY4742 was transformed with pSB416-GPD (2B) and pSB416-S12 (2A).After running on a gel, three correct samples were found: NB1 (NEBuilder Assembly, plate B, colony 1), LA3 (Ligation assembly, plate A, colony 3), and LB2 (Ligation assembly, plate B, colony 2).Tomorrow, we will run a digest on the boiling prep and run on a gel to confirm

colonies.Boiling preps were performed on the 3 mL cultures of pSB1C3/T.U.ligation and NEBuilder Assembly were plated (2 plates with 300 \u00b5L each).Week 3Highlight: pSB1C3/translational unit assembly yields seemingly correct results.No colonies were seen on the p416/T.U.Minipreps were then digested with SpeI to be run on a gel.Both NEBuilder assembled, and ligation assembled plasmids were transformed with E. coli and 100 \u00b5L aliquots were plated on LB+chlor plates.Minipreps were performed on NB1, LA3, and LB2 cultures.Sample NB1 came back showing a single deletion (G 2372), LB2 came back with a double point deletion (TG 2452-2453), and LA3 sequence did not cover the entire MRPS12 sequence and will be re-sequenced.Three of the four yeast transformation reactions seem to have worked.We plated the remaining transformation mixture from Tuesday (-TU-ATG A; +TU-ATG A), transformations with the remaining KLD mixture from Tuesday (-TU-ATG B; +TU-ATG B), and transformations done after new KLD reactions were done using PCR products from before (-TU-Pst B; -TU-ATG C; +TU-ATG C).Digest pSB416, pSB416 - ATG, +MRPS12, and +MRPS12 - ATG with BtsCI and run on separate gels to

pSB416-GPD-MRPS12, and pSB1C3+MLS).On the gel we saw bands at ~1300, ~3000, and ~4500.ligation mixture was used in 6 transformation reactions: three 1 \u00b5L reactions (1, 2, and 3), and three 2 \u00b5L reactions (4, 5, and 6).Today, pSB416 minipreps were digested with BamHI and PvuII and run on a gel.Today, we started 3 mL overnight cultures for boiling preps tomorrow.Also, eight more colonies of Disrupted + and - each were resuspended in 50 \u00b5l water and 25 \u00b5l was spotted on a dextrose plate and 25 \u00b5l was spotted on a glycerol plate.Meanwhile, 1 \u00b5l of the Gblock was run on a gel to ensure it is still useful, which was confirmed.The four minipreps and a pSB416-GPD miniprep, were then cut with PvuII and run on a gel.Gel returned unclear results, so we sent off DNA for sequencing.Transform P and D with pSB416-GPD+MRPS12-ATG clone #2 (correct sequence) and pSB416-GPD-ATG (control).Start precultures for yeast transformation.Boiling preps from yesterday were digested with SpeI to determine if anything unusual was happening at the SpeI site.E. coli was then transformed with the assembly product and plated on LB + Amp plates.preps were then cut with XbaI

plated on -ura plates to select for the plasmid.Week 8Highlight: Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change a premature start codon in our construct.Sequencing came back for pSB1C3 clones.Three colonies were picked from each of these three, resuspended in water, and spotted on both dextrose and glycerol plates.Four transformation reactions were then plated on four plates each: BY4742 + pSB416-GPD; BY4742 + pSB416-GPD-S12; Disrupted + pSB416-GPD; and Disrupted + pSB416-GPD-S12.The digests were then run on a gel.NB1 miniprep was digested with XbaI and SpeI in order to recover the translational unit for new ligation.Overnight cultures for A1-8 grew, so boiling preps were performed on these.The entire 10 \u00b5L V was ligated with 7 \u00b5L I and transformed into E. coli.Assembled product was then transformed into NEB 5-alpha competent E. coli cells and plated on five plates of 100 \u00b5l each.The two fragments were then ligated and transformed into E. coli competent cells.Week 6Highlight: NEBuilder was used to insert our translational unit into pSB416.pSB416-GPD insert fragment was received and resuspended in TE to 10 ng/ml.Transformations were plated onto twelve plates, two plates (A and B) for each of the six transformations with 200 \u00b5L on each plate.When run on a .9% gel, confirmed that minipreps are concentrated enough to use.A dot analysis was performed using NB1, LA3, and LB2 to estimate concentrations for sequencing.Eight colonies were picked and grown up in 3 mL cultures overnight.were purified by QIAquick gel extraction kit.The gel purified I and V (T.U.Miniprep #s 1, 3, 5, and 7 were digested with EcoR1.This ligation should insert the translational unit into p416 where the multiple cloning site was originally.More

Gate Regions in the Primary Structure of the Secretin pIV.\u0094 The pIV porin that we used for our project comes from the bacteriophage f1.In fact, in this article, the pIV porin channel behavior (produced by the filamentous phage 1 to export virions out of its E. coli host) is analysed.Let\u0092s remember that staple.First thing to know, the phage F1 produces a channel porin pIV that is placed in the outer membrane of E. coli.Thanks to that method, bacteria with the open channel pIV and only them can grow on this media.Marciano and his team wanted to see if between those two pIV porins some differences in the permeability of the E. coli\u0092s membrane appeared.So if the bacteria expressing pIV proteins are sensitive to vancomycin it means that the channel pIV is opened.The assembly of the phage is coupled to its extrusion which is done by a machinery composed of three phage-encoded proteins : pI and pXI in the inner membrane and pIV in the outer membrane.However, this last article showed that when using the pIV mutant (pIV*S324G) the bacteria became more sensitive to the action of vancomycin.(Spagnuolo et al., 2010)Beyond the use of vancomycin to highlight the permeability caused by the pIV*, Marciano et al, used a strain of E. coli with a deletion of the gene LamB.Identification of the gate regions in the primary structure of the secretin pIV.They achieved this by random mutagenesis of the pIV gene followed by selection for mutants with compromised barrier function, called \u0093leaky\u0094.This channel is closed (avoiding the lysis of the bacteria) except when the phage is leaving its host ? So it\u0092s possible to open this gate but surely thanks to a gating mechanism provided by the phage.More precisely, pIV is secreted in the periplasm and then inserts into the outer membrane, where it forms a radially symmetrical 14-meric complex with a barrel like structure.Our project \u0093The Gatekeeper\u0094 is based on two scientific publications : the work of Marciano et al.(2010) were able to identify residues in the pIV primary structure responsible for the gating mechanism.These effects are illustrated on the figure 1.Figure 1: Graph showing the effect of vancomycin on the growth of E.Coli expressing or not pIV proteins or pIV* mutant proteins.IPTG is here used to induce the production of pIV via the control of the promoter of this gene.This one codes for a maltoporin placed in the outer membrane.Without this LamB gene, the bacteria can\u0092t grow on maltodextrin (larger than triose) media; The concentration of maltodextrin was determined too (0.2% to 0.6%).(1998) on the

ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+).Moreover, no other differences have been detected between the wild-type and the mutated porin.Figure 3: Sequencing data for the pIV WT and mutatedIn order to generate linear fragments with a targeted randomized region and overlapping ends, we performed PCR reactions using different set of primers :To verify the length of our PCR products, we used a linear version of the

sequence over 16 leaky mutants that went through the first selection step, each presenting mutations within one of the two gates (see figure 10).(Molecular weight : Smart Ladder)During the first selection step on selective maltodextrin media, we were able to get leaky mutants (see figure 6).Figure 6: Growth of leaky mutant on selective maltodextrin medium.As a positive control, we used the

of the QuickLib method used for mutagenesis.This system induces the expression of the porin in the presence of propionate (0,5 mM) and suppresses the expression when adding glucose (1%).Figure 1: Representation of the pPro30 vector used for the expression of the pIV porinTo check the quality of these constructs, we performed a restriction reaction with HindIII.This restriction enzyme is expected to give 2 fragments when cutting the plasmids, one at 3917bp and the other at 2789bp (see figure 1).As expected, we obtained these two bands for each construct after restriction (see figure 2).Figure 2: Plasmid restriction by HindIII.This step provides us further information on the quality of our constructs.The sequencing data confirmed the punctuated mutation (pIV*S324G) located in the mutated porin (see figure 3).Histidine mutations are shown in red and other mutations are shown in yellow.These first results are very promising since a lot of colonies were obtained after the first selection step and the sequencing analysis shows mutants with many different amino acid combinations.We used this concentration for all manipulations onwards.The pPro30 vector is used for the expression of the wild-type and the mutated pIV porin.If, on the same medium, a mutant survives in presence of the ions and dies in its absence or vice-versa, it possibly contains a porin for which the gate opening or closing is regulated by Zn2+ or Ni2+.(Molecular weight : Smart Ladder)After amplification, those linear fragments are circularized back to a plasmid form thanks to the hybridization of the overlapping region and the Gibson assembly method.Figure 5: Plasmid recircularization using Gibson Assembly (B1-B4).Also, it\u0092s quite surprising to see that the mutated regions are rather resistant to mutations, with some porins presenting more than 10 mutations in the gate.Figure 10: Sequencing results of the mutated porins.We observed up to 7 histidines in one of the mutants and the actual porin is made of 12 identical subunits, which means a total of 84 histidines added right on the hinge of this door.With additional sequencing results, it will be interesting to do some statistical analysis of the mutations introduced in the gates.", "safety": "", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track": "Manufacturing", "part_favorite": "", "part_normal":

in isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), the universal precursors to terpenoids like trans-zeatin.In order to produce trans-zeatin, we have inserted the Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 gene tzS and the Oryza sativa gene LOG into E. coli.While this composition is no longer suitable for frying, the DAGs, MAGs and FFAs leftover are high-energy molecules, making the spent oil an ideal feedstock.In order to further breakdown the TAGs, DAGs, and MAGs, we expressed an extracellular lipase from Bacillus stearothermophilus L1[9].When heated to high temperatures during the frying process, TAGs breakdown into diacylglycerols (DAGs), monoacylglycerols (MAGs), and free fatty acids (FFAs)[3].\"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis very-long-chain fatty

lipase L1 into a vessel where extracellular breakdown could occur to create fatty acids and glycerol from triacyl-, diacyl-, and monoacylglycerols.A process flow diagram showing our required equipment and flow streams is below.Process Flow Diagram showing our proposed process for trans-zeatin production using frying oil wasteWe spoke to employees at the City of Fort Collins to discuss how our process would integrate into frying oil recycling in our community.Because zeatin can be used to increase plant biomass, it has potential applications in food, feed, and fuel.We tested strain growth in 100% frying oil (left) and 50% frying oil (right) solutions.Our team attempted to build a functional prototype of both the trans-zeatin production and frying oil breakdown steps of our process.We developed an experiment which grew our strain on frying oil waste (both at 100% and 50% concentrations) donated to us by a local restaurant, The Mayor of Old Town.The process we have designed is for the use of frying oil waste as a feedstock for E. coli which can use that energy to produce trans-zeatin.Next, the mixture would be fed into a continuously-stirred bioreactor containing our E. coli optimized for fatty acid breakdown and trans-zeatin production.Our use of frying oil waste as an alternative substrate for chemical production would not necessarily replace, but expand the amount of frying oil waste recycled instead of sent to landfills.Our process could allow for restaurants to break even or be paid for recycling their spent frying oil.Finally, the supernatant will be transferred to a column for solid phase extraction to create the final product.The results of this experiment showed that our lac promoter:fadD:fadL construct improved the cells\u0092 ability to grow

proposed use of biological hosts to manufacture reagents is part of a larger movement in the synthetic biology community to work towards greener production.The production of cytokinins in bacterial hosts also offers an important alternative to the time- and cost-intensive process of extraction from plant tissues.Ideally, products would be transported outside of the cells.This vessel will need to

was not consistently at higher ODs, but the lac promoter:fadD:fadL strain grew much better.Figure 4: Growth comparison of strains grown on 100% used frying oil solution.From the results, we can conclude that the presence of the genes does not increase metabolic stress on the cell.Figure 5: Growth comparison between a control strain and our trans-zeatin strain in shake flasks over 24 hours.Figure 6: Growth comparison between a control strain and our trans-zeatin strain in shake flasks over 72 hours.Figure 7: Growth comparison between a control strain and our trans-zeatin strain in bioreactors over 72 hours.Throughout these experiments, we also collected suspension samples which we purified and ran on a reverse-phase HPLC column.We found that combining the fadD and fadL resulted in the best growth rate by far.With the concept proven, we moved on to testing all of these constructs in real used frying oil.Both experimental strains were able to obtain increased cell growth compared to the control strain.The data that actually says more about the cells\u0092 usage of the oil is the qualitative data.We suspected that it might have to do with our jerry-rigged dark room (cells got light exposure before we even had a chance to plate), or maybe we did not have high enough intensity light (so we tried exposing the plates to direct sunlight, the heat killed all our cells) or maybe our entire premise on how to measure the kill rate was off.To prevent unintended cell death, we kept our KillerRed strains in a jerry-rigged darkroom.We found that adding that just the fadD gave the cells no advantage over cells that had a similar metabolic load but did not produce fadD (the control - cells containing pSB1C3 with only the lac promoter).Our first issue was the strain of cells we were using did not have a strong lac repressor, therefore KillerRed was always being expressed.We then ran a very similar experiment as before on all of those constructs with the lac promoter plasmid as a control.However if trans-zeatin is better produced while the cells are in exponential growth the fadL by itself would be more ideal.The optimum point in the cells\u0092 growth cycle for trans-zeatin growth would dictate which construct we would want to use.The data of the growth on 100% frying oil is less conclusive.The fadD +fadL cells likely as a whole reached stationary phase much sooner than the fadL cells.We concluded fadD addition was insufficient for increased fatty acid breakdown.Figure 2: Our second growth curve for the breakdown process.When no cells were added the water separated from the Brij 58:oil solution into very clear layers.Another observation that points to the cells using the fatty acids came from the 50% solution.Our results (shown in Figure 4) indicate at least an initial observation that the addition of these constructs is beneficial to cell growth.There is lots of room for error, including: getting a consistent volume of oil in the draw, spinning down the sample all the way to collect all the cells, and pulling off all the oil so only the cell weight is left.This made constructing a kill curve almost impossible, as we lost our control every time at the same rate we lost the cells that were supposed to be expressing KillerRed.Figure 1: First growth curve for the breakdown process.To determine if this is the issue, we will run qPCR to detect mRNA expression.We ran a lot of experiments to try and characterize the KillerRed part.Our team was able to successfully create two constructs, a basic part and a composite part which included an inducible promoter, which encode for the trans-zeatin biosynthesis pathway.The data we got from this experiment shows as little correlation as any of the previous ones we ran.The results from this experiment can be seen in Figures 3 and 4.From this data we can determine that when grown on 50% Frying, 50% Brij 58 solution both of our constructs reach greater cell density than our control.If trans-zeatin is best produced in stationary phase then fadD +fadL would be the better choice.The growth on 100% frying oil was quickly too much to measure using ODs so we switched to measuring cell weight.From this we conclude that the cells were doing something to alter the composition of the media.Growth comparison between lac promoter control, lac promoter:fadD, lac promoter:fadL, and lac promoter:fadD:fadL.This told us that the media was becoming more soluble in water, implying that the cells took up and used the insoluble fatty acids.Growth comparison between lac promoter control and lac promoter:fadD.We speculate that the E. coli may mutate the KillerRed gene so that the cells turn red but no reactive oxygen species are released to induce cell death.Ma, Zhen et al.Both the constructs do better than the control.It seems that the fadD + fadL does the best with fadL not far behind.The viscosity of the oil makes it very hard to work with.Alternatively, it is possible that the E. coli is not producing trans-zeatin at all.Instead of using steric acid, we grew the cells on 0.04% used frying oil.This is illustrated in Figure 1.Once we discovered that having just the fadD wasn\u0092t enough we went back and did more research to see what else we could add to improve its performance.There is no noticeable difference in peaks between the controls and the test strains, and there are no noticeable peaks present at the time of the retention standard.There are two possible reasons for these results.To resolve this, we will use a more sensitive process, liquid chromatography with dual mass spectrophotometry, which can detect trans-zeatin presence in the pico- to nanogram per mL range.We found the the transport of fatty acids into the cell was another rate limiting step.Figure 3: Growth comparison of strains grown on 50% used frying oil solution.The first breakdown construct we made was just fadD under lac promoter control.The 50% oil: 50% Brij58 solution remained at low enough densities that we continued to measure growth using ODs.So we then constructed plasmids with just fadL and a promoter as well as one with both fadD, fadL, and a promoter.", "safety": "Standard safety measures such as long pants, gloves, goggles, and biosafety cabinets were used every day to protect both us and our organisms.Our lab work mostly involved chemicals typical to synthetic biology.For some of our experiments, we did have to take extra safety measures to protect ourselves.To test our breakdown constructs, we wanted to grow our E. coli in a media where the only carbon source was fatty acids.Before getting access to the lab every member had to be certified in BSL 1 safety procedures, hazardous waste creation and disposal, and undergo an orientation on the building we work in and the specific equipment in it.We were required to work with high concentrations of acetic acid, methanol, and formic acid during our extraction (SPE) and detection (HPLC).Fatty acids are very hydrophobic and suspending them into a media that cells can grow in requires surfactant (detergent).We used safety glasses, lab coats, and gloves in conjunction with a fume hood to ensure our safety.Out of concern for safety, we continued our search for a surfactant that had been proven to work in literature and had fewer hazards.This is a strongly corrosive detergent, and would require face shields to work with.Through our research we found that our use of a kill switch for cellular level bio containment was insufficient.In addition to using a laboratory strain of E. coli (DH5alpha) as our chassis we included a kill switch in our design.The trans-zeatin production construct makes a molecule that is beneficial to plants, and harmless to humans and bacteria.As a manufacturing track team, we wanted to create something that could be feasibly scaled up.We eventually found Brij 58, which is very safe to work with.For our work in extracting and

Mumberg, R. M\u00fcller and M. Funk, \"Yeast vectors for the controlled expression of heterologous proteins in different genetic backgrounds\", Gene, vol.By joining yeGFP to the mls with a non-polar chain we hope to observe targeted areas of fluorescence inside yeast cells that might be the yeast\u0092s mitochondria.The two vectors we chose to convert were originally known as p413-GPD and p416-GPD both were produced as part of a 32 expression vector series [9].To begin exploring these opportunities, we adapted two commonly used yeast expression vectors to the RFC 10 standard and used them to express yeGFP preceded by the mitochondrial localization signal from the mitoribosomal protein mRPS12.One of the ways that aerobic respiration can be controlled in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is by manipulating the translation of electron transport proteins.Electron transport china proteins are translated by the mitochondrial ribosome, thus we propose that by controlling the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins we can control aerobic respiration.[7] M. Woellhaf, K. Hansen, C. Garth and J. Herrmann, \"Import of ribosomal proteins into yeast mitochondria 1\", Biochemistry and Cell Biology, vol.Its ability to grow and replicate utilizing aerobic respiration or fermentation, and its ability to survive without functional mitochondria, provide opportunities to control or alter mitochondrial function to optimize production processes or develop novel cellular subsystems in the mitochondrial space.However, there are some other pathways where the protein goes through some processing in the intermembrane space.Figure 2 Individual steps of the import reaction of protein into mitochondrial matrix [6].As shown in Figure 2 above [6], Proteins that are imported to the mitochondrial matrix have a preprotein mitochondria localization signal or mls.yeGFP is a yeast codon optimized GFP protein, its excited by light in the wavelength of 395 to 485nm, and emits light at around 510 to 515 nanometers [7].To compete with fast metabolizing prokaryotes, the surviving strategy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is to quickly convert surrounding glucose into ethanol regardless of the presence of oxygen since yeasts are more tolerant to acid and ethanol [1].We decided to investigate using expression of mitochondria ribosomal protein S12 in yeast as a means of controlling aerobic respiration.When the gene encoding mRPS12 is knocked out in BY4741 yeast, the strains exhibit a petite phenotype and become unable to utilize non fermentable carbon sources like glycerol [5].Without mRPS12, yeast mitochondria lack a functioning ribosome and become unable to produce proteins necessary for aerobic respiration.[3] E.

Southworth and R. Green, \"Mutational Analysis of S12 Protein and Implications for the Accuracy of Decoding by the Ribosome\", Journal of Molecular Biology, vol.These two proteins are called the Translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria (TOM) and the Translocase of the inner membrane of mitochondria (TIM).Once the glucose in the culture is depleted, ethanol production rate decreases due to continuous cell respiration.By gene manipulation, production process can start with aerobic respiration of yeast and switch to anaerobic fermentation when glucose level is low to prevent ethanol consumption.Mitochondria have very specific membrane proteins that will allow for proteins to be imported into the mitochondrial matrix.The series has vectors with different promoter strengths, different ORI\u0092s that affect vector copy number, and different selectable markers but the same MCS [9].[1] J. Barnett and K. Entian, \"A history of research on yeasts 9: regulation of sugar metabolism\", Yeast, vol.[6] K. Fujita, T. Horie and K. Isono, \"Cross-genomic analysis of the translational systems of various organisms\", Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, vol.Thus by manipulating the expression of mRPS12 we hope to optimize ethanol production in yeast.Commonly the preprotein signal is removed by MPP\u0092s and other proteases [6].We proposed that the function of the mRPS12 mls could be verified by creating a hybrid mls-yeGFP protein.When glucose becomes depleted at around 6 hours, yeast starts to consume ethanol as carbon sources [1].By expressing the mRPS12 protein in a haploid mRPS12 knockout strain, we investigated its usefulness as a means of regulating aerobic respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We propose that without mRPS12 expression it is likely yeast will lose the ability to metabolize ethanol.Without the proteins encoded by mtDNA aerobic respiration stops [4].", "design": "", "human_practice": "It was decided that Justin would introduce synthetic biology and the Rose-Hulman
