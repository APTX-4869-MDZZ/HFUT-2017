as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.The third area is light controlling area, which includes a LED light.When it is turned on, red emission will activate the promoter and bacterial cells will express attracting substance; while the LED light is turned off, toxalbumin will be produced.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "To make the project applicable in real life, we designed a device with modified engineering bacteria inside, which can be placed in soil to attract and kill nematodes.Assuming there is a farmland, we took advantage of gas diffusion and nematodes\u0092 movement analogue simulation to find the best position for the device to be placed.We established a database to broaden the scope of our applications, combined with our methods, to kill more different pests.Additionally, it takes time for nematodes to reach the device, so we can determine the distance between the devices we place according to the three-day-period and the crawl speed of nematodes.Let L be the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment, V is nematodes\u0092 crawl speed, and T is time nematodes need to develop into adult.Firstly, we considered a square farmland, to minimize the number of equipment we use, the arrangement mode of equipment is as follows (firstly, we consider the situation with four devices arranged together).As shown above, the white circles represent the devices of colon bacillus, while the bigger circles represent diffusion, with the same odorousness in a circle.Our modeling process is given below:Nematodes can be attracted if the attraction concentration of limonene is higher than the lowest attractant concentration and then can move towards the direction of the highest odor concentration after attracted by the limonene smell[4].Engineering bacteria in our device are able to produce enough limonene as we need.Nematodes move on a 2D plane.The rules of the movement are as follows:The nematodes move towards 4 different directions: front, behind, right and left;Every time the nematode choose one of the 4 directions randomly and the probability of these 4 directions are the same;If the nematode move to the place where the gas concentration is lower than the previous position, then the nematode will move back to the previous position.We did the different simulation experiments with one device in the farmland and four devices in the farmland separately.In order to apply our hypothesis and methodology to more agricultural pests control, we established a database.And we can achieve remote control by using radio technology.With these improvements to our device, we want to figure out how we can put our technology into practice in farmland, and whether our device would be more efficient and economical than the methods used currently used in killing nematodes (crop-dusting mostly).In order to meet the lowest attractant concentration, the concentration of limonene produced by every device should be (24.8 g/cm^3).The explanations of simulation: In the video above, we built up a simulation model of the movement of nematodes using the cellular automaton in MATLAB.Based on the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment which has been acquired in the first question, we obtain:Considering that odorousness will be reduced with the increase of distance away from the device, we should only consider about the superposed odorousness at point F(considering four equipment now) to reach the lowest attractant concentration.We set the attraction time as 3 days and the distance between two devices is 100 m. As the evenly distribution of nematodes is from 5 cm to 15 cm underground, we put the device into the place which is 10 cm underground.In order to answer these two questions, especially the second one, we need to conduct a simulation of the movement of nematodes to determine the most suitable place in the farmland to place our device.In matrix A, we assume that the device is put on row i and column j (i, j).In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.It shows how nematode moves in a real farmland with the device.We hope this new environment-friendly method, based on principles of synthetic biology, could be shared with and improved by the researchers all over the world.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.Because the movement range of nematodes is within 10cm and the distance between two devices is much longer than 10cm, we can ignore the depth.When the gas diffuses in space, the concentration is not affected by temperature, aerodynamics or other factors.The device emits gas continuously and the concentration is uniform in space.And after the gas diffusion, the attractant concentration will stabilize.Considering that we need to control the density of nematodes in a proper range, we hope to do this by killing all the mature nematodes within certain period of time under the identical condition.(2i+1)(2sqrt{Dt})^{2i+1}}) end{array} end{equation}This is the schematic diagram of our device in a 300m \u00d7 300m farmland according to results of simulation.First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.Thus we obtain:Where C1 is the superposed odorousness diffused from the device, C0 is the lowest attractant concentration.According to Fick s Law, We obtain a 3-D gas diffusion model.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).Orientation of the entomogenous nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae to carbon dioxide[J].Its mathematical expression is as follows:$$frac{partial C(t,x)}{partial t} = D_{A}frac{partial ^2 C(t,x)}{partial x^2}$$C(x,t) is the concentration at the distance of X from gas source in t, N0 is the concentration of gas source, D is the diffusion coefficient.According to the model above, we obtain the gas diffusion model in 3D.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.And we found that the Meloidogyne needs 8.5d-10.5d to develop into second instar larvae from monoplast egg according to an exiting literature[9].And according to the principle of isotropy, we simplify the problem in 1D.We build a gas diffusion model to calculate the gas concentration at each point in matrices.Since the three dimensions have no difference between each other, we simplify the question into a 1-D situation according to isotropy.According to Fick s Law, points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of x Since the three dimension has no difference between each other, we simplify the question into 1-D situation according to isotropy.A brief introduction to the Fick s Law: It points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of X, the change rate of concentration to time is equal to the negative value of the change rate of diffusion flux to distance.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\u0092s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.We will update relevant information about the engineering bacteria we designed to kill the pests in our database.Currently, our database contains the biobrick we established in this project and the one established by team ZJU-CHINA.All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!Liang W, Li Q, Chen L, et al.The proportion of virtual nematode and real nematode is 0.0084.The nematodes is distributed randomly at the beginning.It\u0092s obvious that in this farmland (do not consider points on the sides of the square), point F is the farthest point away from the four equipment.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.And the procedures below were conducted in a fume hood.Step 3.What\u0092s more, squares ABCD are the simplified farmland.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.We will attract nematodes into our device in time d and kill them in time d. We found that all nematodes are killed after two \u0093slaughters\u0094.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.We hope to take a better use of this new environmental-friendly method from the context synthetic biology and share it with researchers all over the world.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.We opened the faucet of the separating funnel in order to let HCl flow into the test tube under the atmospheric pressure.In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on nematode trophic groups in a Chinese paddy-field ecosystem[J].Ye H Y, Ye B P, Wang D Y. Molecular control of memory in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans[J].This change fulfills our aim to save money and energy, which is also more economical and enviromentally friendly.As shown above, device 2.0 has two shells \u0096 an outer shell and an inner shell.", "notebook": "The goal of our modeling project is to give a best attractant of concentration so that we can determine the most economical plan.We prepared the L-limonene and D-limonene and the synthases expression E. coli (BL21,pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) without standardization of them both, which were cryopreserved with glycerol.We prepared the BW25113 competent cells in terms of the component efficiency kit, and we detected their efficiency of transformation by transforming rfp-PSB1C3 plasmids of different concentration into the cells.We transformed pSB1C3-rMpL into BW25113 competent cells to cultivate on the LB plate and inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the obtained monoclonal colony to produce bacteria solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We revived the limonene synthases expression E. coli strain preserved in glycerol.We assembled bace16-pSB1C3 and transformed it into E. coli DH5?.And we processed nematodes\u0092 chemotaxis replication experiment of limonene as well.We also did expression replication experiments by doing SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample) which came out an obvious band (89kd).We ensured the empty vector plasmid was correct with three groups of restriction digestion.We repeated the induction experiment with different concentration gradient of arabinose as before, while we just collected the precipitation without extracting proteins this time.We built a device all by handwork!We inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the monoclonal colony to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction, and we named the obtained plasmid pUC57-rMpL.We digested the plasmid PSB1C3-RFP sent by iGEM and the pUC57-rMpL with restriction enzyme separately and obtained the PSB1C3 backbone and rMpL gene segment which were connected together later on to assemble the plasmid PSB1C3-rMpL.Together with members majoring in physics, mathematics and biology, we drafted an abstract settlement concentrating on how to simulate the concentration of nematodes in chemotaxis.And we sent plasmids extracted this time for sequencing.We re-prepared the homogenate of the revived E. coli-BL21(pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) for SDS-PAGE and enlarge cultivated the standard bacteria (BL21-pSB1c3) transformed the second time to express the objective product.We transformed bace16-pSB1C3 into the newly obtained BW25113 competent cells to express for another time, and examined the result with SDS-PAGE.We went on the expression experiment of rMpL as above except that we added parallel controll groups whereas canceled the control ones expressed under 37C and prolonged the expression period.After the result of digestion exam was correct we extracted the plasmid and did sequencing, and we transformed the plasmid with correct sequence into E. coli BW25113 to establish expression strain.We activated the preserved culture and enlarge cultivated it in 250 mL conical flask, inducting expression with different concentration gradient of L-arabinose, we collected the precipitation after centrifuging the bacteria solution.Additionally, we learned the life history, growth properities and feeding method of nematodes.We prepared nematodes for enlarge cultivation and induced expression of the LS expression E. coli, and we synchronized a batch of nematodes for verification.We digested rfp-pSB1C3 with two isocaudamas Spe I and Xba I and prepared empty vector plasmid as negative control of whether the desired gene expressed.Since we could get the solution of best concentration of attractant and the diffusion of nematodes, we decided to go towards a further step.We transformed into E. coli DH5? the bace16-pSB1C3 to find that the result of plasmid extraction and enzyme digestion was correct, thus we confirmed the problem was from the expression strain.We re-cultivated the collected bacteria and mixed up the recombined bacteria with the control ones to a certain scale (1:4) to coat on NGM medium, preparing for nematodes cultivation of toxic test.Another important module of our project is to build a database which researchers and even farmers can get information of bio-pesticide easily.Then we recycled the backbone and gene segments following the agarose gel DNA extraction kit and linked them to produce plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3 and d-limonene-pSB1C3.We continued to watch the movement of nematodes under toxic test, where the nematodes of M9 group was generally active, partly died of bace16 and heated bace16 groups, and acted normally in pSB1C3 group.Another SDS-PAGE of extracellular proteins extract was run while the objective band was still not observed.However, we still failed to observe obvious expression of rMpL, against which we suspected there occurred something wrong with the expression bacteria and planed to change bacteria strain to express de novo.We put the database on the github.com and it can be edited and added new items by all users.We transferred plasmids with correct sequenced d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS gene into expression strain E. coli BL21 respectively to express LS and GPPS.The problem was confirmed to be from the expression strain as mentioned above, so we adopted a new strain of BW25113 and continued our experiment.We enlarge cultivated the standard LS expression bacteria (E. coli-BW2513-pSB1C3) and expressed the objective produce (in contrast with empty vector).Congratulations!We tried some simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation to be familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We designed parts rMpL and bace16 by adding pBAD promoter (BBa_K206000) and RBS(BBa_B0034) to the upstream region of rMpL gene and bace16 gene, and we committed the GENEWIZ company to synthesize the rMpL and bace16 gene segment.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.So we re-transformed the plasmids from the company into E. coli DH5?and BL21 separately and did all the cultivation, plasmid extraction, enzyme digestion de novo to make sure the examine result correct.The results of SDS-PAGE suggested that d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS were expressed successfully.Incubate the bacteria with 8 (mu)M, 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose , run SDS-PAGE after ammonium sulfate precipitation.Change the E. coli strain to express rMpL, only add 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose for incubation this time.To test if rMpL is expressed in the pallet or the supernatant, ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to enrich the protein.using Ultrasonication and SDS-PAGE are also used during this process.This week we discussed factors that would influence the putting model of equipment on the farmland.So we extracted the bace16-pSB1C3 from the expression strain BW25113 for restriction enzyme digestion and no objective band was extracted still.We inoculated the obtained monoclonal colony into 10 mL centrifuge tubes to produce bacterium solution for plasmid extraction, the enzyme digestion result of which was incorrect that a band around 500~750 bp appeared whereas the backbone band lost.We examined the extracted plasmid with enzyme digestion, no objective band observed as a result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry powder.However, we regrettably observed that the effect of expression is not ideal from the SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis of both the homogenate and the supernatant.We realized that our original assumption that we regarded nematodes as static models couldn t react to some essential properties of nematode moving.We transformed the plasmid rfp-pSB1C3(BBa_J04450) in DH5? and proceeded amplification to obtain the standard plasmid backbone.We prepared some common used reagent such as TAE, antibiotics and LB cultural medium.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.We extracted the plasmid and did restriction enzyme digestion to test and verify the plasmid backbone PSB1C3, and preserve the correct plasmid for subsequent experimental use.We designed the sequence of Limonene synthase (LS) that would be transformed to E. coli to express.Our designed sequences were based on the two cDNA sequences of LS expression sequence--Citrus unshiu CitMTSE1 for d-limonene synthase and Mentha spicata 4S-limonene synthase, together with prefix and suffix codes and restriction enzyme cutting site were sent to the company for optimum synthesis.We obtained the plasmid of gene rMpL with PUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.The results verified that compound limonene could attract nematodes preliminarily.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria of experimental group and control group.We did SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample), no significant difference observed between the bands.In addition, the differences between bands of BW25113 and BL21 were obvious when ran SDS-PAGE together whereas the objective band of BW25113 couldn t be ensured.We expressed bace16 protein twice and prolonged the expression period to overnight.At the same time, we carried out the experiment of attractive interactions of limonene towards nematodes several times.Third, we had built a basic frame of the database.Sequencing gene l-limonene and d-limonene synthesized by the company to get an unsatisfactory result, we speculated that these plasmids were extracted from the wrong BW25113.Also we improved our device and made a 3D model of it, which we called Device 2.0.To verify whether limonene had been synthesized by bacteria, the fermentation broth was tested by GC-MS in School of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University.According to pair t test, we concluded that limonene could attract nematodes.According to the original paper, rMpL is soluble protein expressed inside the cell, so target protein should be still in pallets.The correct plasmids examined with restricton enzyme digestion was preserved in -20\u00b0, named l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57.We digested the plasmid pSB1C3-RFP from iGEM as well as l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57 separately with restriction enzymes to get pSB1C3 backbone and the two gene segments, among which the brightness of pSB1C3 backbone band was quite weak.That\u0092s why we had to make it by hands.We tried another protocol of replication experiment as increasing the amount of sample whereas the effect was still not ideal indicated by the statistical result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.Considering there are so many factors can\u0092t be predicted in the real situation, we talked about how to idealize and simplify our putting model.In order to testify if engineering bacteria have the ability to express limonene, amplification cultured bacteria liquid covered with n-hexane was cultured in the shaking table to express production.Inhibition is observed on the plate inoculated with recombinat bacteria.Through a lot of discussion among our group, and with accumulating realization and knowledge of this program, we finally came up with a method to solve the problem of how to place equipment we made on the farmland.We optimized the protocol of replication experiment on and on, and the growth condition of nematodes is favorable.Finally, we chose traditional technology to produce devices in the future if it was verified that our device had high value of application.At the same time, we make the model revision.Run SDS-PAGE and get bands which might be rMpL.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria.Still, we failed to observe objective band at all the supernatant of bacteria, homogenate and supernatant of ultrasonic broken cells.We induced expression of rMpL continuously with arabinose in concentration gradient to acquire a stable expression condition.Meanwhile, it appeared to be some problems of other groups\u0092 digestion too, against which we speculated that the cause may be the pollution of reagent, star activity or something wrong with the expression strain.GENEWIZ gave us the relevant feedback in time and modified the two sequences to synthesize again.We did the simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation again to be further familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We started to work on it.We transformed the obtained plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3?d-limonene-pSB1C3 into E. coli BW25113 and cultivated 10mL centrifuge tube with them to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We found the gene sequence of bace16(AAV3D0845) and the cDNA sequence of MpL(GeneBank accession number HQ449739) from the Genebank, and optimized the coded sequences in E. coli.After we determined the theme of our project, we recuited more undergraduates from related colleges, including college of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.Second, the device we had made actually was not applicable enough, which required further improvement.No positive results are observed in 4 days.Cultivate recombinant bacteria, bacteria with empty vector or OP50 bacteria for nematoxicity test of rMpL protein.As we discussed the influencing factors last week, our main work this week was to search documents to see what exact influence these factors would bring to our result, and whether these factors can be ignored or idealized.After being amplification cultured and expressing aiming products, the bacteria were smashed by ultrasonication.However, the cost of product by 3D print is too high.We also transferred empty pSB1C3 plasmids into expression strain E. coli BL21 and regarded them as the control group.Finally our plan is to design and build a debug device.We cultivated nematodes and proceeded synchronization, and we did replication experiment of baiting nematodes with linalool using pure chemical compound (linalool).", "protocol": "Incubate upside down at 37\u00b0C overnight.Flush nematodes from the plate

mentioned above as experimental group and NGM plate with blank E.coli as control group.Make 3 repeats of each concentration.Flush nematode from the plate with M9 and inoculate 20 (mu)L (about 30 nematodes) into the center of the medium.Inoculate 5mL LB liquid mediums added Chl with experimental group E.coli BW25113 (transformed with rMpl or bace16 genes) and blank control group

adown to contact the medium.Watch the growth condition of nematodes under the stereoscope everyday and re-inoculate every 4 to 5 days to avoid the nematodes growing too densely.For inoculating abundant nematodes rapidly, or changing plate to provide more food and better condition for them, we can flush them with M9 and centrifuge them with 1500 r.m.p for 1 min, and incubate the precipitate on a new plate.Grow slowly at 16\u00b0C and grow fast at 25\u00b0C while egg laying amount declines.Inoculate NGM medium with 150~200 (mu)L OP50, incubate at 37\u00b0C for 12hr.", "result": "2) occurs inBased on the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP in the pathways mentioned above, GPP synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation between IPP and DMAPP to synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the burden for E. coli, so in our research, we transferred both GPPS gene and LS gene into theIn our project we decided to use E. coli, MEP pathway to express limonene.We then add 5?L 5% limonene (T) and DMSO (C) respectively at the two small circular filters in the experimental groups(Fig.This proves that many terpenes can attract plant-parasitic nematodes in naturalSome researches showed that limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\u0092s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many kinds of volatiles to induce nematodes that are harmful to these predators.We put two small pieces of circular filter paper 2.5cm from the center of the circle (Fig.Later we add 30?L suspension of the nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\u00a0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.", "safety": "In addition, we established a photoinduced bidirectional transcription system regulated by light, where we can divide the process of attracting and killing nematodes into two periods to realize the relatively timing and quantitative release of the toxic proteins, bringing down the retention in the environment.Thirdly, a suicide system was constructed based on the principles of quorum sensing in microorganisms which would enable us to control the bacterial colony density artificially and therefore the quantity of engineering bacteria can be maintained in a stable and controllable range.Considering the biosafety, we improved device 2.0 into a relatively closed unit, and we also designed a dome to cover the medium.(Fig.1)We replaced GFP and RFP with limonene synthase and toxic protein respectively, so the release of the two proteins can be regulated by gp35 directly, and by light signals indirectly.Generally speaking, the Switch system works in this way--provide the system with light of wavelength in 600nm at first so gene gp35 will be repressed and the system will express the chemical attractants like limonene.In conclusion, the significance of our system is that we have built a photoinduced bidirectional system to avoid a simultaneous and strong expression of the bait and toxic proteins, in which way we can avoid the potential harm done to environment by the system.We not only considered the potential safety problem caused by the high expression of the toxic protein and attractant, but also designed a suicide system for our engineering bacterias to solve the problem by regulating the population size of our bacterias.We built our system based on the phenomenon of quorum sensing[1].In addition, replacement as well as remove of medium and engineering bacteria would all be done in the labs or safety rooms of factories which guarantee relative closure of the device used in farmland and avoid engineering bacteria spreading.Although Bace16 and rMpL are both toxic proteins towards nematodes specially, the over expression of these proteins can also break the ecological equilibrium inevitably.While when the concentration of attractants reaches a certain point (see modeling part), we would turn off the light to trigger the expressing of protein gp35 to push the system work in a reverse direction so that the toxic protein would be expressed.In addition, after the engineering bacteria works, the device would be recycled and the residual bacteria would be disinfected.3.Is it safer, cheaper, or better than other technologies that do the same thing?We concluded the action objects and disadvantages of various traditional nematicides of China according to related literatures, and the result is shown below.High toxicity Do harm to the soil, the environment even the health.This complex can bind with promoter luxpR, after which the transcription of mazf gene in the downstream will be triggered and bacterias will be killed by toxin protein MazF[2].Firstly, we designed a device to cultivate E.coli inside and restricted their movement at the same time, thus preventing the difussion of our engineering bacteria to soil.Will it be sterilized, discarded, or recycled?Our device is designed to be recyclable so the growing state can be checked at regular intervals, which means once something wrong happens, we can adjust the bacterial colony timely.With the biosynthesis of PCB, Cph8 can serve as a photoreceptor that regulates gene expression through PompC.In order to regulate the direction of promoter J23110 under the light signal, an integrase, gp35, is added to the upstream region of the PompC promoter.We constructed two main circuits.When gp35 expresses, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.Cph1 is a member of the plant photoreceptor family.As for environmental safety, on one hand, we design a semi-closed device to avoid the spread of engineering bacterias in which way we could increase the safety level and improve the attracting and killing efficiency of our bacteria; On the other hand, light-regulated bidirectional transcription system can avoid over-expression of toxin proteins, and the design of suicide part can regulate the population density of engineering bacteria.This system can be divided into three main parts: photoinduced system, bidirectional transcriptional system and bait-killer system.The red light sensor (Cph8) is a fusion protein which consists of a phytochrome Cph1 and a histidine kinase domain, Envz-OmpR.The first one expresses gp35 serine integrase,(Fig.1) which can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP, the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome.All in all, biosafety is ensured in both the developing and the application stage of our project.1.At first, the plasmid expresses GFP.It is probably do harm to the crops.It is suitable for the burst of the nematodes disasters.Next it is beneficial to the creatures who live in the environment suffering serious nematodes disasters because the traditional nematicides do harm to human.For instance, all team members in the lab should wear clothes for lab-use, wear gloves and work in the super clean bench when necessary; poison reagent should be used in the fuming cupboard; and the waste liquid and medium

Histidines are positioned in such a way, that they can coordinate the ions from two to four orthogonally oriented directions. Free binding sites of the ions are then exposed, so that a His-tagged protein can attach to them. This protein can be used to complex up to 4 nickel or cobalt ions. The underlying design of the protein is of a particular interest, too. LRRs are highly conserved motifs throughout evolution. They appear in all kingdoms of life in almost every thinkable role (ligases, receptors, toxins etc.). Their core is highly conserved and provides a very stable backbone, while the non-conserved aminoacids are almost freely interchangeable. Here we investigated an optimal set of non-conserved aminoacids by analysing large sets of similar proteins and databases. You can use this piece of work as a template to design your own protein and give it any function you like, by simply interchanging aminoacids and fusing other domains on the N or C termini. To guarantee proper folding and to shield off the hydrophobic core, a well studied fragment of an LRR protein coming from hagfish was used. The efficiency of this technique was proven before (Schmidt 2010). To find out the most likely folding, we designed many different protein sequences, trying out a variety of sets of non coding aminoacids for the LRR and submitted these to the I-TASSER structure prediction\nWe only submitted one of the three versions to the registry to reduce redundancy. Please contact us for any questions. Plastic binding domain\n\nOne of the issues of our project \u0084lab in a cell\u0093 was to use endogenous proteins produced by the cell itself for specific purification and hereby to replace expensive columns. The \u0084precipitator\u0093 designed by our team contains a protein binding domain which complexes nickel and thus enables the binding of His-tagged proteins. After cell lysis the \u0093precipitator\u0094 is freely dissolved in the cell lysate. To be able to isolate the \u0093precipitator\u0094-His-tagged-protein-complex from the other cell components it has to be immobilized by another protein domain. The part we designed for this function is the so-called plastic binding domain. During routine phage display of random peptide libraries, phages were found that bound directly to the plastic surface of the used plastic micro titer plates. The number of plastic binding phages obtained during the phage display experiments depended on the saturation of the plastic micro titer plates with target protein for the antibody-binding phages and could be reduced by the use of blocking proteins as BSA or non-fat milk. Plastic binding phages were resistant to washing steps with PBS alone as well as to PBS in combination with BSA or non-fat dry milk. It was shown that plastic binding phages were even more difficult to recover by acid elution than the \u0093normal\u0094 antibody binding phages (Adey et al., 1995). The binding strength of the plastic binding protein was best on polystyrene plastic surfaces and also observed on PVC-plates (Adey et al., 1995). The mechanisms by which the phage surface proteins bind to plastic are not well understood. The plastic binding amino acid sequences showed no obvious sequence similarity but where generally enriched by Tyr and Trp residues and are completely devoid of Cys residues. It is possible that the binding comes off non-specific hydrophobic interactions due to partial denaturation of the protein (Cantanero et al., 1980) and potentially due to interactions of the Tyr and Trp residues with the aromatic moieties of the polystyrene plastic surface of micro titer plates. As well as high hydrophobicity does not necessarily imply plastic binding quality (Menendez et al., 2005) the observed plastic binding phages showed hydrophobic peptide sequences on their surfaces. Expressing such hydrophobic proteins in our host organism E. coli can lead to problems with inclusion bodies or decreased vitality up to cell death. During our experiments we couldn\u0092t obtain any clones containing both the gene for the plastic binding protein and a constitutive promoter-RBS-construct. We finally succeeded in expressing the plastic binding domain using an inducible promoter. To test the plastic binding domain and get data for our modeling we hereby used an IPTG-inducible promoter. In our completed \u0093Lab in a cell\u0094 model the plastic binding domain, as a part of the \u0093precipitator\u0094 would be expressed by one of our light inducible promoters. Green light receptor\n\n\nSometimes a regulated and coordinated gene expression and therefore protein production is needed. We decided to use light-controlled gene expression, because light is everywhere and always available. The green light receptor is a light-sensing system from the cyanobactrium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. It consists of three parts interacting with each other in order to start regulated gene expression. These parts are the following: The main receptor is CcaS(1), a cyanobacteriochrome, which shows increased autophosphorylation after exposure to green light. The protein CcaS is made up of a N-terminal transmembrane helix, a cyanobactreria specific GAF domain, two PAS domains and a C-terminal histidine kinase.", "human_practice": "?SynBio Oath\n\nSynthetic Biology is a subject and a trade in which the researcher is facing a growing number of questions on a daily basis. Working in the development of technology that uses the very building blocks of nature in order to enable humankind to manipulate its surroundings, maybe even itself in an entirely new way, holds issues which need to be addressed. Synthetic biology carries the inherent risk to interfere with life itself on many levels \u0096 it is a vital part of the self-conception of the modern scientist that this imposes great responsibility on the part of the researcher. In order to make an informed decision, said researcher must rely on data gathered by the scientific community. Thus a common concept of good research and professional behavior is indispensable. The SynBio Oath is meant to express for oneself as well as to society the principles on which ethical, beneficial and safe research is conducted: Every researcher is responsible for his own work, but the implications of SynBio go beyond an individual, therefore to take the oath must be a personal commitment and independent from corporate and ideological structures. It reflects the intention to gather genuine information just like one must expect every other scientist to do, and puts into words a pride in one s profession that does not allow for vanity or greed. To give the oath more substance and to better connect scientists with each other, it is backed by a community of peers who ensure the keeping of their principles and further promote the oath and the ideas it stands for among life scientists. SynBioOathLogo.png\nThe oath\n\nI know I don t know everything.", "modeling": "?Modelling: Rational protein design\n\nThe Idea\nFirst there was the idea to replace the chemically produced Ni-NTA columns by some biological, reproducible material. It seemed unreasonable to produce an ion precipitating substance in a complicated, energy consuming way \u0096 completely artificial, while so many proteins in nature are capable of the same task \u0096 and much more complicated things. But how to harness that? The second milestone in the generation of the idea came up in a lecture of Prof. Martin, about Nickel allergy. He found a mutation in the TLR-4 receptor that introduces Histidines in the LRR motif of the protein, which are capable of binding nickel and thus forming complexes of receptors on the cell surface of immune cells, triggering the inflammatory reaction. Freiburg11Modelling1.png\nSchmidt 2010 a) Two sequences of a TLR-4 from mice, one with mutations, a phenotype showing Nickel allergy(Histidines marked red), one wild-type without a Nickel allergy. b) assumed superimposition of Nickel ions binding on the LeucineRichRepeat structure of the TLR-4\nThe core structure\nThis was the necessary clue that gave answer to the question. In the following work, a lot of investigation about the perfect Nickel precipitating protein was done. It seemed that there is no optimal natural protein which would serves our needs. Furthermore, many of the natural LRR proteins \u0096 of course \u0096 have their own biological function, we we were afraid could interfere in the cellular system we wanted to express them in. Luckily there are over a thousand already known structures of LRR proteins, what gave us a broad choice of motifs to choose and compare. The Construction of a new protein After a long and detailed search, we found out that it is most reasonable to use bacterial LRR motifs, since they seemed very well conserved in sequence, and they are the shortest \u0096 with only 21 amino acids per LRR repeat. (Wei 2008, Kajava 1998). We wanted to have a protein as simple and as predictable in behavior and structure as possible. Several search inquiries led to the most conserved and shortest of all bacterial LRR (PDB: 3CVR), unluckily this protein is a toxin derived from Yersinia pestis. We of course did not want to mess around with toxins,\nFreiburg11 Seq1.png\nThe aminoacid sequence of a bacterial\nligase we chose for our design (PDB:3CVR)\nespecially not with one of the black plague. We also did not know what amino acid pattern on the LRR motif would cause the toxic effect. Probably, there would have been no harm in using this protein alone, even if we did clone and express it, but why should we do that when we have a huge choice freely available anyway. Finally, we settled on the bacterial ligase PDB:3CVR. A ligase would be definitively harmless, especially since we planned to restructure it entirely. To do this we needed to understand how the structure of the Ligase was made up. Our desired protein LRR motif was only a part of a bigger protein \u0093factory\u0094 which included several domains that seemed to serve distinct functions \u0096 more than we had use for. So we exclusively used the LRR domain. It seemed to us that this domain had mostly a structural role in this \u0093factory\u0094, but we could still not exactly tell. To avoid any unspecific biological function it was necessary to rearrange the amino acid composition. We fed the protein sequence in a free online consensus sequence generator called weblogo from the Berkeley University. Freiburg11Modelling2.png\nConsensus sequences derived from the repeating loops of the 3CVR ligase to work out the conserved aminoacids and shared chemical properties of the different positions in the loops. By analyzing the logo it was obvious which positions of the LRR motif were conserved and which not \u0096 AND: which of the non-conserved amino acids appeared in what kind of pattern. Were there positions in the protein that required a polar amino acid? Or a non-polar, hydrophobic /-philic, charged, non-charged one?. We compared the consensus sequence with the 3D structure, using PYMOL, to extract as much information as possible, and then came up with this ideal consensus sequence:\nFreiburg11 Seq2.png\nideal consensus sequence extracted from the consensus motif above\nimposing desired functions\nThe next consideration we had to do was: how many Nickel do we need on the surface of our ideal Nickel binding protein, in what pattern, with what distances between, and at which angles toward each other to allow proper ion complexion? Nickel can be complexed by imidazole structures from 4 planar orthogonal directions, as well as to axial positions. It can, however, only take four ligands at once - preferably in a planar orientation. Cobalt has a bipyramidal setup for ligand-binding, too, but can take up to six ligands. The distances from an N-atom in the Imidazole ring to the ion had to be between 3 and 6 Angstr\u00f6m.", "notebook": "None", "protocol": "None", "result": "?results\n\nPrecipitator\n\nBBa_K608406 Precipitator\n\nProtein domain of Precipitator.

It is meant as protein that binds Nickel ions with Histidines grouped on its surface. The bound Nickel can then precipitate His-tagged proteins. In our Lab in a Cell it should function as an adaptor between the plastic surface of pipettes and the His-tagged protein. Please look at our detailed description of the design layout in our modeling section. The sequence was synthesised and cloned into the iGEm vector. The submitted sequence was fully confirmed by sequencing.

You can use this piece of work as a template to design your own protein and give it any function you like, by simply interchanging aminoacids and fusing other domains on the N or C termini. To guarantee proper folding and to shield off the hydrophobic core, a well studied fragment of an LRR protein coming from hagfish was used. This technique was investigated before\n\n\nSource\nThe part is constructed from the following protein sequences (PDB: 2z66) N-Terminal hagfish (PDB: 2z62) C-Terminal hagfish (PDB: 3cvr) bacterial ligase\n\nMathematical modeling\nTo determine the Affinity k_D, experiments to find out the binding affinity of the plastic binding domain are necessary. To get a direct access to these values, we cloned the plastic binding domain in front of a GFP. Then, dilution and washing assays could be performed on polystyrene microtiter plates, red out by a fluorescence plate reader. The desired parameters could be calculated by measuring dilution rows of GFP proteins and measuring the fluorescence signals at the different concentrations. C_total could be determined by a dilution row with subsequent washing steps, to find out at what [P] concentration there is a saturation. See description of the plastic binding subproject for more detailed explanation on the experimental setup. A qualitative experiment to prove that Nickel is binding the Precipitator is sufficient, since k_2 >> 1 and does not play a significant role in our setup. This experiment could have been done using a nanofilter that blocks protein but let through ions. The Nickel concentration of the flow through can then be measured. Alternatively purification of the Precipitator by fusing it with a GST-tag could be done, to subsequently measure the absorbance of the protein, before and after adding Nickel to the solution. After Jordan 1974 a detectable change in the absorbance should be detectable after the complex is formed. A similar effect \u0096 a colorshift from white to blue - is visible when one prepares a Ni-NTA column. For this purpose we cloned the GST domain in front of the Precipitator. However towards the end of the project there was no more time to perfom these experiments.

The submitted sequence was partially confirmed by sequencing. Results\nThe non-purified, sonificated supernatant of a 50ml E.coli culture pellet was resuspended in 7.5ml PBS. This sample delivered 319,4 \u00b5g/\u00b5l of protein detected with a Bradford assay. A second identical sample was GST-purified with a Glutathion-Sepharose pull down assay and resulted in 1ml of sample with a protein concentration of 1,6 \u00b5g/\u00b5l. However both concentrations were a little above the straight calibration line values. Therefore the results are not perfectly quantified, but the numbers are still significant enough to provide a good proof of the functionality of the assay. Then the GFP fluorescence of 100\u00b5l of supernatant of both samples was measured with a plate reader:\nNon-purified: 180630\nGST-purified: 243011\n\nThus the ratio of GFP absorbance / 1\u00b5g protein is:\nNon-purified: 5642\nGST-purified: 1432257\nIf the values of the Bradford assay are assumed as correct, the purified sample has a 254x higher GFP concentration than the non-purified sample. Due to 3 washing steps it can be assumed that there is barely any other protein left except GFP. Furthermore it can be estimated that only 17% of the total GFP amount present in the 50ml cell culture, could be captured using this assay.

the secondary structure prediction regions against the primary sequence, and we did not pick split sites that fell in these regions.Our second criterion was to avoid largely hydrophobic regions, likely corresponding to the protein\u0092s interior regions.The model aligned the \u0093annotated catalytic domain\u0094 against the primary sequence, and we did not pick split sites that fell in this window.Using these three criteria, we used our MATLAB tool to predict optimal regions in which to split our proteins.We hypothesized that such a model could lead to an important predictive tool for scientists, if it could ultimately find the few optimal places to split a protein that would create inert split halves but yield robust activity when dimerization occurs.Our first criterion was to avoid the secondary structures in the protein: the alpha helices and beta sheets.The model aligned the hydrophobicity profile against the primary sequence, and we did not pick split sites that fell in hydrophobic windows.Our third criterion was to avoid splitting within a known catalytic domain of each of the proteins.One of the main aspects of our project was to develop and refine a model that would help us predict the best places to split a protein, in order to most efficiently implement conditional dimerization.However, these are most easily identified through protein 3D structural analysis, rather than through the primary sequence.Over time, we think that more computational tools will be developed that can provide more insight into various levels of protein structure and how these contribute to function, and these could potentially be integrated into the model.We hypothesized that splitting through these sheets could also potentially disrupt folding activity and function.We used an online tool (JPRED) to predict where there would be alpha helices and beta sheets in the protein.The overall goal of the model was to narrow down the window of split site choices by focusing on feasible regions - regions that would be least likely to interfere with secondary, tertiary, and quarternary structure elements.This tool required input of the primary structure (linear amino acid sequence) of the protein as the input, and gave an output with the secondary structure prediction based on the linear sequence.Therefore, we focused on avoiding hydrophobic regions in the protein and targeting hydrophilic regions.We used the Janin hydrophobicity scale1, which assigns each amino acid in the primary sequence an index based on how hydrophobic it is (the higher the number is, the \u0093more hydrophobic\u0094 the amino acid is).We hypothesized that splitting within this functional domain could really interfere with the protein\u0092s overall activity.We wanted to avoid any such huge potential disruptions to protein activity so that our system would still have robust activity when the protein halves dimerize.We looked into the literature and found any relevant annotations of our proteins of interest, especially noting where catalytic domains may have been located.Protein primary sequence corresponds to the fundamental structure of the polypeptide chain; it is comprised of a string of amino acids that are covalently linked by peptide bonds.Also, we think that with more experimental validation, including our analyses, we can further refine some of the criteria.Ultimately we someday hope to see a refined tool that can input a protein\u0092s primary sequence and predict the most optimal split site(s).(This was our main contribution to the model itself.)Read our considerations below to learn more.We realized that these criteria do not account for all elements of a protein\u0092s secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure.Loops and turns are structures in the protein that might actually contribute significantly to overall protein function (many of these are binding sites).We took a running average of the hydrophobicity of 11 consecutive amino acids in the model to create a hydrophobicity profile of the entire protein.Theoretically, given that a protein that is n amino acids long, there are n-1 places to split the protein, since one can split the primary sequence between any amino acid (i.e.any peptide bond can be cleaved to yield two halves of the protein).Such a tool would be incredibly useful for researchers interested in splitting arbitrary proteins of interest, as well as for truly understanding all elements of protein structure.Our results for our protein splits can be found in the individual results sections of our application pages: Integrase/RDF results and SaCas9 results.We did not find catalytic domain/residue annotations for all of the proteins, and thus these images may not have these elements.Below is an image that incorporates all our criteria for one of the proteins that we tested.", "notebook": "Bacterial ProtocolsTo clone split protein constructs into our conditional

Up to now we are working on the descriptive phase of molecular biology. (...) But the real challenge will start when we enter the synthetic biology phase of research in our field. We will then devise new control elements and add these new modules to the existing genomes or build up wholly new genomes. This would be a field with the unlimited expansion potential and hardly any limitations to building \"new better control circuits\" and(...)finally other \"synthetic\" organisms, like a \"new better mouse\".

These parts can be extracting from existing organisms or be the results of a chemical synthesis after an artificial design. The SynBio can be divided in two approaches: top-down and Bottom-up.

The natural E. coli chemotaxis has limited receptor proteins which can respond to only six kinds of amino acids. Nevertheless, the reprogrammed chemotaxis named pseudotaxis makes the engineered E. coli able to respond to molecules, whose receptor proteins do not exist in classical E. coli, such as IPTG and L-arabinose, etc. E. coli have several flagella per cell (4\u009610 typically), which can rotate in two ways : counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW). [1][2] The former aligns the flagella into a single rotating bundle, causing the bacterium to swim in line, while the later breaks the flagella bundle apart such that each flagellum points in a different direction, causing the bacterium to tumble. The motility is determined by the phosphorylation state of CheY protein which is governed by CheZ protein. In the presence of CheZ protein, CheY-P is dephosphorylated and produce CheY, thus CheY leads to the flagellar motor rotating CCW resulting in swimming. In the absence of CheZ, CheY is phosphorylated into CheY-P which can bind to the flagellar switch protein FliM resulting in tumbling (Figure 1). [2] \nFigure 1.

Coli is one of the gram-negative bacteria and most of their types are harmless. However some of E.Coli types such as enterohaemorrhagic E.Coli (EHEC) can cause serious diseases. In our project we designed an innovative model to prevent gram-negative growth and infection. In our model, to prevent E.Coli growth, we modified non-infectious gram-positive bacteria B.Subtilis by transforming it with a construct, which was designed to produce limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) together with a signal peptide. LALF is expected to bind and neutralize Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in gram-negative bacteria cell wall.

Typical near-shore areas that form the prime habitat of the horseshoe crab can easily contain over one billion Gram-negative bacteria per milliliter of seawater. Thus, the horseshoe crab is constantly threatened with infection. Unlike mammals, including humans, the horseshoe crab lacks an immune system; it cannot develop antibodies to fight infection. However, the horseshoe crab does contain a number of compounds that will bind to and inactivate bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Anti-LPS factors that are synthesized in the blood cells of crab are part of this primitive \"immune\" system. Lots of horseshoe crabs are collected by some manufacture companies and their blood is extracted in some laboratories. During the extraction process, up to 30% of the animal s blood is removed. Research has shown that once returned to the water, the horseshoe crab s blood volume rebounds in about a week. But, it is also noted that a number of crabs which cannot be undervalued are also dying during the process. 590_crash_blood.png (613\u00d7359) \nIn our project, we aim to produce those factors by using the synthetic biology. In this way, we can obtain them without extracting blood and hurting any crab. Additionally, the possible medication will be gathered cheaper. In our project, mainly we study on a protein that is gathered from horseshoe crab (limulus polyphemus), limulus anti lipopolysaccharide factor (LALF). By the help of this protein, we planned to stop bacteria growth in vitro situations. Ppk?jougj.png (393\u00d7369)\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, is the major mediator of septic shock, a serious complication of Gram-negative bacterial infections in humans. Molecules that bind LPS and neutralize its biological effects or enhance its clearance could have important clinical applications. Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) binds LPS tightly, and, in animal models, reduces mortality when administered before or after LPS challenge or bacterial infection. The wedge-shaped molecule has a striking charge distribution and amphipathicity that suggest how it can insert into membranes. The binding site for LPS probably involves an extended amphipathic loop, and it has been proposed that two mammalian LPS-binding proteins will have a similar loop. The amphipathic loop structure may be used in the design of molecules with therapeutic properties against septic shock. To make it possible, we use Bacillus Subtilis as a host; because it is supposed that this bacterium cannot be affected by LALF. Preventing such possibilities during our experiments will help us to get the best and the clearest results. On the other hand, we want to apply our anti-LPS factor on a surface as a coat in order to obtain an anti-gram negative bacterial surface. Normally, B.subtilis has the ability to produce biofilm.

The advantage of the system is that antiviral processes in the cells start even before a virus infects cells. We discussed several possible approaches and finally focused on split proteins as a possible initiation point of a new signaling pathway. Two split proteins were found to be potentially useful (Stagljar and Fields, 2002; Wehr et al, 2006), ubiquitin and tobacco etch virus protease (TEVP), because they both result in a proteolytic event, which can liberate the next protein in the activation cascade. Split ubiquitin system\nFor the purpose of our project we fused CD4 transmembrane receptor with the C-terminal part of ubiquitin (Cub), and CCR5 (or CXCR4) with the N-terminal part of ubiquitin (Nub). Our pathway could thus be induced by both HIV-1 and HIV-2 (which uses CXCR4 as the coreceptor for binding onto target cells). The basic idea behind our approach was that dimerization of receptors caused by HIV enables reconstitution of Nub and Cub. The reassembled ubiquitin is recognized by the ubiquitin-specific protease and cleaved at its C-terminus. If we append an effector protein onto the CD4-Cub fusion, the specific protease would thus release the effector, which is fixed on the membrane in an inactive form before dimerization. The principle of the split ubiquitin assay is described HERE. It is likely that HIV causes dimerization of just a few CD4 and CCR5 receptors, therefore we could not rely on only a few effector protein molecules (e.g. caspase-3 or interferon ?) being released.

In all cases, T7 polymerase translocates into the nucleus, where it transcribes an effector gene, as well as T7 RNAP gene (self-amplification).

They reproduce and multiply themselves, causing disease by local cellular injury, secretion of toxins, or antigen-antibody reaction in the host. The spectrum of bacteria changes with time and the introduction of antibacterial agents. Nowadays, the emerging issue in this field is the appearance of multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and extensive drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria. Yet the development of resistant strains of bacteria could be limited by the judicious use of antibiotics. In order to use the appropriate drug, knowing the antibiotic pattern of the invading bacteria is of importance. The routine process to identify causative organism in hospital, culturing and sensitivity testing for a specific antibiotic, is found to be sensitive. Bacterial infection may be further classified by where the infection occurs, into community-acquired infection and nosocomial infection. The strains of bacteria, infection site, and epidemiological transmission pathway all differ between them. Nosocomial infection is of increased importance. MDR or XDR are present in hospital environments such as MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and Acinetobacter. Urinary tract infections, pneumopathy, and infections of surgery site are most common because of the formation of biofilm on the surface of catheters, endo-tubes, etc. What\u0092s worse, due to the drug-resistance, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial nosocomial infection become a serious problem.

Communication is a \"two way\" process. When you communicate you perceive the other persons responses and react with your own thoughts and feelings. It is only by paying attention to the other person that you have any idea about what to say or do next. Bacterial communication:\nBacteria communicate with another one using chemical signal molecules. As in higher organisms, the information supplied by these molecules is critical for synchronizing the activities of large groups of cells. In bacteria, chemical communication involves producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to small hormone-like molecules (called acylhomoserine lactones, AHL). This process, also known as quorum sensing, allows bacteria to monitor the environment for other bacteria and to alter behavior on a population-wide scale in response to changes in the number and/or species present in a community. Nevertheless, AHL molecules are broken down by other bacteria, and some AHL signals are poorly soluble in water, so they cannot travel far in an aqueous environment (this factor limits their potential as a long communication signals). Outer membrane vesicules in bacteria\nGrowing gram-negative bacteria (like E.Coli ) release vesicles from their outer membranes as a means of delivering toxins to host cells and other bacteria. This mecanism is conserved among Gram-negative bacteria. The vesicles consist of a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core and they can therefore transport lipid-soluble toxins (lipopolysaccharide endotoxin) on their surface and protein toxins in their core. They release their content by fusing with the lipid bilayer of target cells. The project :\nWe decided to improve bacterial communication thanks to the vesicles formation process. In this direction our engineered communication platform consists in controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins of the Tol/Pal system. The over-production of TolR (a major protein of the Tol/Pal system which ensure the membrane integrity) has to be controled to avoid the bacteria death. Another important key point of our project is to obtain a delay between the production of protein of interest and the vesicle formation, to be sure that the produced vesicles carried the different protein required for the recognition of the target bacteria and thus the one essential for the signal transduction. Producing the messenger :\nIn order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with our protein of interest and OmpA signal sequence or the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. OmpA is a major protein of the external membrane of E.Coli and is also localize on OMVs.", "design": "None", "human_practice": "None", "modeling": "?This part aimed at solving the first problem linked to the creation of messengers :\n\nTo improve the quality of signal sent, how can we get a good synchronization between the maximal vesicles production rate and the maximal concentration of proteins to encapsulate\n\nObviously, it is crucial to send vesicles only when the concentration of proteins to encapsulate is at its maximum level in the periplasm. To optimize the quality of our message, we tried to make this peak of vesicles creation corresponding to maximum levels of protein concentration. We assumed that the number of vesicles produced is at its maximum when the concentration of TolRII has reached its peak. In what follows, we consider two different designs for implementing the delay: using a transcriptional cascade and using feed-forward motifs. We found that the design based on transcriptional cascade is sufficient for obtaining the desired delay[1], whereas the design based on feed-forward motifs allows for more flexibility, at the cost of an increased complexity[2]. These studies are described below. Implementing the delay by a transcriptional cascade\nWe have decided to construct the following system. The addition of arabinose to the medium leads to the activation of the pBad promoters: two proteins are produced: the protein to encapsulate and LacI-LVA[3][4]. The latter inhibits the expression of TetR and thus releases the inhibition of TolRII, responsible for vesicle formation. To study this system, we simply used differential equations. We used the method described by U. Alon in his book An Introduction to Systems Biology, with notably Hill functions to describe the regulation of the promoters[5]. The network behavior can be described by a system of differential equations:\nDifferential System\nModeling Overview\nThese equations describe the evolution of the concentrations of the messenger protein P, LacI repressor, TetR repressor, and the TolRII protein responsible for vesiculation. The gammas are the degradation rates of the respective compounds, while the sigmoidal functions describe the non-linear production rates. The parameters are estimated according to typical values as discussed below\n\nAs a first approximation, we assumed that :\nWhen the pBad promoter is induced, the concentration of arabinose in the medium is very high and constant during he whole study; as a consequence, we will consider that the creation rate of Protein P and LacI* is constant during the experiment:\nArabinose constant\nWe considered that all the binding constants are identical[6] and of an average of 40nM which correspond to approximately 40 monomers per cell; we can write that:\nBinding constants\n\nWe chose identical intrinsic promoter activities, ??, all equal to 4000 proteins/cell cycle:\nBinding constants\n\n\nAll the time units were expressed in units of cell cycle (approximately half an hour). As a consequence we chose a dilution rate ?? of 1 for protein without special tags. For the LacI protein with a degradation tag (LacI-LVA), the dilution rate is 3 times higher[3]:\n\n\nWe got the following dynamics using Matlab software, showing that this simple system is capable of generating the desired behavior. Plot showing that vesiculation happens only once the protein encapsulated has reached its maximal concentration. Implementing the delay by feed-forward motifs\nUsing the previous design, we were able to find a way to get the maximal vesicle formation (ie maximal TolRII quantity) when the concentration of proteins to encapsulate is at its maximum. This system satisfies our requirements. However, it is not very flexible. In particular, the concentration of the protein to encapsulate remains always high after induction. This could be detrimental for the cell if this protein is toxic. Consequently, we considered an alternative design allowing for more flexibility, in which the expression of the protein to encapsulate can be transient. The Feed Forward Motif\nThe feed forward motif was studied and described by U. Alon in his book \"An Introduction to Synthetic Biology\" where he describes the different forms of existing feed forward; they can be either coherent or incoherent[7]. In each case, there exist a different network organization to create a feed-forward loop as shown on the picture\n\n\nThe X and Y inputs can be combined either using a logical AND or OR gate thus giving different dynamics properties in each case. The coherent feed forward loop allow the creation of a delay either on activation or on deactivation depending on the logical function between the two input X and Y. When the output logical gate is an AND function, the delay appears on activation, while when the output gate is an OR function, the delay appears on deactivation. An example of characterized feed-forward loop is the fliA system which was used by the 2008 Paris team in order to create a oscillator. In an incoherent feed forward loop, the two inputs of the last gate function have two different logical levels; one molecule (molecule X for example) is an activator while the other molecule is a repressor of the promoter controlling the expression of the output.", "notebook": "None", "protocol": "None", "result": "?Experimental Results\n\nIn order to prove the feasibility of our project 5 main points needed to be adressed:\n\n1.", "safety": "None", "keywords": "None", "track": "UnKnown", "part_favorite": "None", "part_normal": "None", "theme": "None", "hits": 0}, "highlight": {"modeling": [" vesicles creation corresponding to maximum levels of <font color='#f35762'><b>protein</b></font> concentration.

Edinburgh s 2011 iGEM project is a feasibility study into the creation of biorefineries using E. coli, the workhorse of synthetic biology; and whether biorefineries can be improved by arranging for the different enzymes involved to be in close proximity to each other, so as to create synergy between them. We investigated two methods of bringing the enzymes close together: cell surface display via Ice Nucleation Protein, and phage display via M13 s major coat protein. We attempted a new DNA assembly protocol, provisionally named \"BioSandwich\". We constructed computer models of synergy to assess whether it is a feasible option. Finally, we considered the broader economic and social questions surrounding the construction of a biorefinery: can it be done, and should it be done? Synergy\n\nIn many applications, several enzymes are needed to produce the desired product.

Berkeley 2009 tried several different carrier proteins with several different passenger enzymes, and had success in many areas. However, when they tried attaching cellulases, they weren t so successful - of the two quantified cellulases, one worked just as well without the carrier (Cel5b) and the other didn t work (Cel9a, as compared to negative control). We will try a different carrier. The BioBrick BBa_K265008 made by UC Davis 2009 is a synthetic, codon-optimised sequence, based on GenBank AF013159 and coding for the first 211 and last 97 amino acids of Ice Nucleation Protein (INP, normally coded by the inaK gene) from the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. It seems promising as a carrier of enzymes. Fusions are carried out at the INP C terminal. Three strategies for INP-based cell display. After Van Bloois et al (2011)\nVan Bloois et al (2011) speak highly of INP, and claim that it can be displayed at a copy number of around 100,000 copies per cell without affecting viability. INP has major domains at its N and C terminals, as well as a number of internal repeating domains. There seem to be three strategies for using INP (see figure):\nUse the entire INP protein; fuse at its C terminal\nDelete the INP internal domains; fuse at its C terminal\nDelete all of INP except the N domain; fuse at the new C terminal\nBBa_K265008 should be suitable for the 2nd strategy. Linkers\nIt is probably desirable to create linkers between the carrier and the protein of interest, to give the proteins space to fold. The new assembly protocol that we are investigating \u0097 BioSandwich \u0097 should be ideal for this. Complete system\nThe complete 3 cellulase system could contain a promoter, driving expression of three coding fusions:\nINP -- (Linker) -- endoglucanase (e.g. BBa_K392006)\nINP -- (Linker) -- exoglucanase (e.g. BBa_K392007)\nINP -- (Linker) -- ?-glucosidase (e.g. BBa_K392008)\nAn alternative: protein chains\n\n\nThe protein chain idea: a long fusion protein is created with INP fused to (say) 3 enzymes in a row... Instead of making three different fusions, it might be possible to make one fusion that had all three cellulase enzymes linked together; we call this \"beads on a string\". As it happens, the exoglucanase (Cex) and the endoglucanase (CenA) both have a cellulose-binding module (CBM), but they are at different ends of the sequence. So here s the plan:\nCreate a fusion of:\nExoglucanase (catalytic domain) -- CBM -- Endoglucanase (catalytic domain)\nThis can be done by homology or by introducing an NcoI site into both Exo- and Endoglucanase at the appropriate locations, then ligating and doing fusion PCR. We can then use KpnI in a similar way to attach a ?-glucosidase at either end. Then attach INP.", "human_practice": "?Human Practices\n\nContents [hide]\n1 The need for questions\nBiorefineries: design and economics\nBiorefineries: life cycle analysis\nBiorefineries: social implications\n2 Edinburgh and the iGEM Community\nThe need for questions\n\nThe field of Synthetic Biology is relatively new, and so its long-term implications are the subject of debate.", "modeling": "?Modelling\n\nOne way of assessing the feasibility of the synergistic approach to biorefineries is to use in silico modelling.

So, we are growing S.cerevisiae which express LDL cholesterol receptor and inhibits the absorption of LDLcholesterols in the blood vassel. Details of Each Projects\n\nBioclock\nBiok.png\nSynthetic Oscillatory Gene Circuit in E.coli Cells\nWe are working on an oscillatory gene circuit in each individual E.coli cell according to the circuit design which was reported by J. Sticker and his colleagues in 2008. Also, we are making the switch to turn on and off the oscillator. The oscillator sould be turned on after UV exposure, and turned off automatically after a few hours. Clock1.ppt\n1. Activating the Oscillator by UV Radiation\nThe switch consists of two genes derived from bacteriophage lambda, cI and cro. The expression of two genes is mutually exclusive. The initial state is the cI expression, which means the oscillator is turned off. When UV light is exposed, cI is cleaved by RecA, one of the SOS genes of E.coli, and cro starts its own expression. As a result, the oscillator is turned on. The reason why these two gene can control the oscillation is that cI enhances lacI which is a component of the oscillator while cro doesn??t, as explained just now. 2. Oscillatory Expression. (J. Sticker et al, Nature 2008). The oscillator consists of one negative feedback roop by lacI gene and one positive feedback roop by araC gene. In this circuit, araC, lacI, and GFP are under control of the same promoter (denoted as P_araC/lacI) which is suppressed by lacI and enhanced by araC. The oscillatory period is from 10 min to 40 min, and dependent on the concentration of IPTG, arabinose, and temperature. 3. Silencing the Oscillator\nA gene called cIII enhances cI and turns off the oscillator. CIII is also controlled by P_araC/lacI. Here is the mechanism: When cro is expressed (which means oscillator is on), still other gene cII is expressed together. cII is capable of enhancing cI expression, but is unstable under normal condition, because it is attacked by Hfl protease of E.coli. cIII prevent cII degradation by competitive inhibition of Hfl. Consequently, cII can induce cI expression only when cIII exists in the concentration high enough to inhibit Hfl activity. 2. 3. 2. 2.", "design": "None", "human_practice": "None", "modeling": "?Overview\n\nAs we described in the project overview of the bioclock project, the actual clock consists of two separable parts: a bio-oscillator and a lambda phage switch. In this section we will be modeling each of the parts and have come up with an integrated model, resembling the ultimate goal of the project. By making comparisons between the results of our model and the results of the original article which we based our simulation upon, we examined how realistic the model is, and tried to gain a better understanding of how the oscillation process and, eventually, how the integrated model works. Bio-Oscillator\n\nConstruction of the Model\nIn the natural world, there are quite a few systems that are known to act as an oscillator. The project started out by examining the behavior of Cyanobacteria. We learnt that the mutual activation and repression between several compounds resulted in the oscillation pattern of protein expression. We finally settled on creating a system utilizing lacI and araC as the mutual-interaction compound to construct a oscillator. Although it is possible to trace the reactions in detail all the way from the transcription of mRNA and translation of the proteins with the precise reaction rates, it will be redundant to do so. In order to maintain clarity, we simplify this process to focus only on the rate of translation. One of the defining characteristics is the dual role of the promotor. It could be bound to a maximum of two lacI proteins and one araC protien. When araC is bound to it, it activates the translation of both araC and lacI, increasing lacI concentration while enhancing the possibility of lacI binding to the promotor as well. When the promotor is bound to lacI, it could transmute in to a looped form, to which araC cannot bind. We will note the state of promotor as Suusiki 1.jpg, where i represents the number of araC molecules bound, while j represents that of lacI. According to [1], the reaction involved in the dynamics of the promotor state changes and the reaction can be summarized as follows:\nTodai susiki matome1.jpg\n\nwhere \nTodai susiki matome2.jpg\n\nand X is the total number of ssrA tags in the system. k_{a}(It is a tag in order to quicken the disintegration process of the proteins.)", "notebook": "None", "protocol": "?Miniprep Protocol\n\nPreparation (previous night)\nPick Single colonies from a transformation plate and culture in 4ml Luria Broth\nCulture overnight at 37\u00baC with vigorous shaking\nMiniprep\nAliquot 2ml of the bacterial suspension from above into a 2ml eppendorf\nSpin down for 5 min. at max speed to pellet cells\nUse the Promega miniprep kit according to instructions\nWe usually elute the plasmid DNA from the spin column by 50\u00b5l MilliQ and measure nucleotide concentration on a spectrophotometer to label on the tube.

Mercury occurs in the environment combined with other elements and naturally in different chemical species with distinct solubility, reactivity and toxicity. Occurring in volcanoes and mercury mines, which are responsible for emissions of mercury in the order of 2700-6000 tons/year (Micaroni et al. 2000). In the Amazon, it is also used in mines in the amalgamation of gold (Au-Hg) (Figura 1), where a quantity of metallic mercury (Hg0) is released upon rivers and soils by the , and through the outdoor burning process, which releases element s vapor to the atmosphere, that leads to the aquatic ecosystem contamination. Figure 1. Direct contact with mercury in the Amalgamation of gold process. In Amazon rivers, about 3000 tons of mercury are available and can be bioconverted in its most toxic forms for living beings, through methylation - the addition of the radical CH3 \u0096 of mercury, bioaccumulative properties are acquired by its high affinity to animal tissues (Souza and Barbosa, 2010). The mercury methylation is a crucial step to its entry in the aquatic food chain organisms, because of it are the main affected by contaminated fish ingestion. Figure 2. Death of fish caused by dumping Mercury in the river. Worldwide, there are cases of accidents with mercury as occurred in 1908 with the chemical industry Chisso Corporation that produced fertilizers settled in Minamata Bay in Japan. In 1932 the factory started to produce acetaldehyde, mercury sulfate in production, reaching 6,000 tons in 1951 and 42,245 tons in 1960. Chisso s factory did not properly dispose their liquid waste, which were released into Minamata Bay since 1946, being continuously disposed residue, eventually affect sea Shiranui and others around it. In April 1956 the first signs of poisoning in people and changes in the ecosystem of the bay were observed. After humans and cats had the same symptoms and marine creatures are constantly found dead, the condition was named Minamata disease. The level of mercury contamination of the Minamata disease patients in the 50`s, reaching up to 705 ppm. The second major accident is recorded in Iraq (1972), where epidemic proportions of mercury contamination were observed after wheat seeds were treated with alkyl mercury and were inappropriately consumed as food. It is not known how long it takes to develop symptoms of mercury poisoning or not, Because it is directly dependent on the form, concentration and time of exposure to the metal. After these accidents occurred, conventions and legislation in countries were determined individually, in addition, this type of action demonstrates the awareness and concern by government part. The use of mercury has diversified into areas such as industrial, metallurgy, chemical industry, medical equipment, dentistry, among others. Particularly, the use of mercury has become high in the Amazon, this metal is used in prospecting for gold extraction. The misuse in the region generates not only human intoxication, but serious environmental problems.

Besides the error in the use of mercury in terms of quantity, there is another contradiction of laws related to the regulation since the national legislation which governs the drinking water is the Ministry of Health and the one to rule over the aquatic environmental systems is the National Environmental Council (CONAMA). Based on CONAMA N\u00b0 357, March 17th, 2005, the classification of waters is valid for the entire national territory. The classification is done in 9 classes, and the resolution separates fresh water (salinity < 0.05 %) in five types: Special Class and Class 1 to 4, in which the restrictions impurities decrease as the number of the class increases. Saline waters are classified as Class 5 and 6, and brackish waters are Class 7 and 8. The resolution also determines the maximum allowable levels for effluent discharge into the waters, except for special class of waters that cannot receive releases wastewater as it is intended for domestic supply and should be absent of coliforms. For Class 1, the maximum mercury content allowed is 0.2 mg/L for Class 2 is 2 mg/L, for Classes 5 to 7 is 0.1 mg/L, and for other classes there\u0092s no maximum levels specified. For other waterbody (class 1-8), which are neither the sub-surface nor special class, is tolerated dumps that meet the specifications of maximum (Hg = 0.01 mg/L) and has a maximum flow of 1.5 times of the activity average daily period of agent launcher, as soon as they do not exceed the limits set for their classes. Thus, legislation allows a higher concentration in the effluent than in the waterbody, believing that there is dilution of which was released. However, it is known that there are many sources of pollution that contains the same harmful substance that discharge their effluent into the same body of water, this fact can lead to concentration of substance and exceed limits of resolution. In summary, Brazilian legislation only attempts to control the discharge of effluents, it does not act in maintaining the environmental quality of the receiving waterbody.", "keywords": "None", "track": "UnKnown", "part_favorite": "None", "part_normal": "None", "theme": "None", "hits": 0}, "highlight": {"modeling": [" periplasmic <font color='#f35762'><b>protein</b></font>, that binds to mercury ion to carry it to one of the transporters", ", with <font color='#f35762'><b>proteins</b></font> merP, merT, merC, merF and merA, where the first one a"], "background": [" homeostasis to <font color='#f35762'><b>protect</b></font> against damage and maintenance of survival (Biondo, 2008)."]}}, {"_index": "team_wiki", "_type": "wiki", "_id": "AV7S9h8KY9Y1IdxdLr99", "_score": 4.700099, "_source": {"year": "2010", "team_name": "Warsaw", "attribution": "None", "background": "None", "description": "?Our project is divided in following parts: \nRBS Measurement\nPromoter Measurement\nMinC based kill switch\nBactoDHL - universal platform of protein and DNA delivery to mammalian cells based on invasive coli strain\n\nRBS Measurement\nIn order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we have conducted measurement of various ribosome binding sites included in 2010 spring distribution.

GNU GPL) was created. There are many great parts and devices created by the community members and released freely to the community. In addition there is very little awareness of keeping community-developed parts and their derivatives free-as-in-freedom, meaning that the work is available free of charge but can also be freely accessed and used by anyone to create new parts that still remain in the Public Domain. This can lead to the situation when work which was intended to remain in the Public Domain would be patented as a part of some project and the results of this project would not be returned to the community. Moreover this allows the situation in which it s legal to remove original author attribution information from parts containing elements developed by others. We recommend that all biological parts released to the community should be licensed in a way that ensures that the original part as well as all other parts using it can be obtained, used and modified without any limitations. We also recommend that single licensing scheme based on Creative BioCommons licenses (see below), a Creative Commons derivative applied to biological parts, should be adopted by synthetic biology community. This will ensure that original author attribution information has to be included when a new part based on the work of others is developed. Moreover Creative BioCommons license is inherent, meaning that all derivatives of the work (ie. BioBrick part) licensed under BioCommons have to be licensed alike. In simple words this gives a legal warranty that all You create with intention to share with others will remain in the community. Additionally it ensures acknowledgment of Your authorship. BioCommons in plain words \nFor all those who are not lawyers here is simple explanation of CreativeBiocommons features. Both BioCommons and BioCommons non-commercial are based on Creative Commons license texts with definitions updated to apply to biological parts. Creative BioCommons license allows\nfree-as-in-freedom usage, modification and distribution of biological parts covered by this license \nBioCommons allows commercial usage of covered materials, BioCommons non-commercial forbids it \nas long as\nparts that are build upon elements licensed under BioCommons are licensed alike (licensing BioCommons is perpetual) \noriginal information about authors of all subparts is retained \ninformation about parts is distributed with link to BioCommons text \nit is forbidden to\nchange licensing of parts built upon BioCommons licensed parts to less open one.

However, even though TOR pathway is proved to be a central element of signaling transduction, research on TORC1 of yeast are not so clear and well-understood for us to directly learn from. Fortunately, noticeable work has been done on mTORC1 (mammalian TOR complex 1) that modulation in certain amino acid sites could improve the activity in response to adverse nutrient status and inhibitors. The high homogeneity between TOR in yeast and mammalian TOR (43% of TOR2 and 39% of TOR1) makes it possible to transplant the mutations of mTOR into the yeast. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of eukaryotic cell growth. In particular, mTORC1, one of the two complexes that contain mTOR, is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, proliferation, cell cycle and autophagy.", "human_practice": "None", "modeling": "?Our modelling is based on the following signal transduction network of TOR protein. As we discussed before, the major part of signaling transduction is regulated by the rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 complex either via the Tap42-Sit4/PPA2c or the recently identified Sch9 branches. Nevertheless, Sch9 branch appears to have overlapping functions with cAMP-PKA pathway,and be additionally regulated by proteins not contained in central TOR pathway. Besides, as most of the downstream transription factors are definitely regulated to Tap42-Sit4/PPA2c, we decide to simplify the modelling part to this branch only. In normal yeast cell, TORC1 (Tor complex 1) with phosphorylated Tor2 is in a functional state, which is able to phosphorylate Tip41 and Tap42 which would bind together when dephosphorylated. PP2A1 and PP2A2 belong to a PP2A family that has the ability to dephosphorylate other proteins. PP2A1 consists of Pph21/22 and Cdc55/Tpd3, which are catalytic and regulatory subunits respectively. PP2A2 consists of Sit4 and Sap, which are catalytic and regulatory subunits respectively. However, phosphorylated Tap42 is more likely to bind catalytic subunits of PP2As, like Pph21/22 or Sit4, which means phosphorylated Tap42 suppress the activities of PP2A1 and PP2A2. PP2As could dephosphorylate some transcription factors, like phosphorylated Rtg1/3, Gcn4, Gln3, etc, as well as phosphorylated Tap42 and Tip41. The activity of TORC1 can suppress the activities of PP2As. In our project this year, multiple inhibitors \u0094FAP\u0094, which are short for furans, acetic acid and phenol could inhibit the activity of TOR protein. When FAP exists in vivo, TORC1 (Tor complex 1) will be dephosphorylated, leading to an inactivated state without the ability to phosphorylate downstream proteins (Notice: The equilibrium constant\n\n\ncan reflect the resistance of Tor2 to FAP to some degree).", "notebook": "None", "protocol": "None", "result": "?After the reconstruction of TOR pathway, data and results are necessary for testing the system.", "safety": "None", "keywords": "None", "track": "UnKnown", "part_favorite": "None", "part_normal": "None", "theme": "None", "hits": 0}, "highlight": {"modeling": [" <font color='#f35762'><b>protein</b></font>.

Once these transgenic organisms are built, they are grown to sufficient titer before extracting the protein of interest. In the case of microorganisms, this is performed in large bioreactors, where cells are grown to high densities to maximize productivity. When the protein of interest is excessively large, or strongly overexpressed, a heavy metabolic burden is imposed on the host, causing cell growth to slow and resulting in loss of productivity [ 1 ]. Additionally, selective pressure against highly productive cells tends to exacerbate this problem over time. Soon the bioreactor will become inefficient, and will have to be ??restarted??, a long and costly process. The goal of this year??s uOttawa iGEM team consists of generating a yeast strain capable of long term protein expression. Yeast\nYeasties.jpg\nHeterologous (foreign) proteins are often expressed in simple microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g. E. coli) or yeast. The two most used yeast species are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, which are well characterized genetically. Yeast provides several advantages for large-scale production, especially for the production of eukaryotic proteins, including fast growth rate, high yield, post-translational processing similar to mammalian cells (e.g. glycosylation), and efficient secretion systems. In our project, we employ the yeast S. cerevisiae (baker s/brewer s yeast) as the chassis for our expression system. Pulsate Gene Expression\nGene expression in cells is a dynamic process in which transient responses are often observed. This can be conceptualized as a ??pulse?? of protein concentration.", "design": "?The Design\n\nUsing a CRE1-expressing yeast strain, our goal was to develop a gene regulatory network that would trigger a transient pulse of gene expression upon induction. Many transcription networks in nature have recently been found to contain certain recurring ??network motifs?? that occur more often than in randomized networks [ 4,5 ]. One type of motif that has been described having pulsing ability is the feedforward loop. Specifically, it is the Incoherent Type 1 Feedforward Loop (FFL), and has the following topology:\n\nFeed Forward General Motif.jpg\n\nFigure I - Incoherent Type 1 Feedforward regulatory motif \n\nHere A, B represent transcriptional regulators of a gene C. If A is inducible, it can turn on genes B and C upon induction. If B-mediated repression of C is strong when induced by A, the result is a pulse generator. The incoherent type I FFL is the most common of all natural feedforward loops in both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as determined by screening transcription network databases [ 5 ], suggesting that the structure may possess an evolutionary robustness. In our system, the induced transcriptional activator (A) is SKN7 and C is our protein of interest. We include TetR as our transcriptional repressor (B). When activated, SKN7 will induce both the protein of interest C (e.g. GFP) and TetR. TetR will accumulate and repress transcription of C, resulting in a pulse of C expression.", "human_practice": "None", "modeling": "?Variables\nOur models contain the following variables and species:\nSpecies table.jpg\n\nParameters\nThe values for the parameters governing expression of the core signaling components (IP, CRE1, YPD1, SKN7) were taken from the model of Chen and Weiss [ 1 ]. The parameters specific to our system were either gleaned from the literature if available, or were varied within reasonable ranges to explore their effect on the dynamics of the system. Receiver cells\n\nN, M and IP are total culture variables. Cell density (N, M) is modeled as logistic growth, with carrying capacity Nmax, Mmax. Continuous culture dilution may be chosen rather than batch culture by setting a nonzero dilution rate (kdil). Inducer concentration (IP) in the reactor is affected by an overall degradation rate (kdip), the culture dilution rate (kdil), and binding/releasing of the molecule to the receptor in both its phosphorylated (CRE1p) and non-phosphorylated (CRE1) state. IP is assumed to diffuse rapidly across the cell membrane so that intracellular and total culture IP concentrations are the same at all times. The effective ??receptor concentration?? in the total reactor volume (mol receptors/culture volume) is estimated by multiplying the cellular concentration of receptors (mol receptors per cell/cell volume) by the cell density times cell volume. Simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics is used to model enzyme-mediated degradation of IP by CKX. With these assumptions, we derive the differential equations below (adapted from Chen and Weiss [ 1 ]).

Once we turn on the device, the medium will become green. Afterwards, when the time is up or the concentration of bacteria invaded rises to a certain level, the medium will turn from green to red. The whole reaction can be divided into three stages:\nStandby: The E.coli only grow but other specific metabolism is excluded. Lactose-accession: The lactose is added and the timer and the counter functions started. Lactose-consumption: When the lactose consumes or that the amount of the bacteria invaded is large enough, the alarm                                         system starts and the E.coli suicide later. (1)\tThe Switch and The Input\n\nThe lacI operon serves as the switch of our project, and lactose works as the starting signal. At the beginning, the constitutive promoter (BBa_J23106) unceasingly produces the LacI protein (BBa_C0012), which represses the LacI promoter (BBa_R0010). When fixed amount of lactose is added, the lactose-lacI complex releases from the promoter and causes the transcription and the translation of downstream sequences begin. (2)\tThe Timer\nWithin the reaction, the lactose degrades by a constant rate.", "human_practice": "None", "modeling": "?The dynamics model constructed for ??Bacterial referee??\n\n\nMotivation\nOur team constructed a controllable synthetic genetic circuit in E. coli which has timer and counter functions. The ability to design a DNA sequence that reliably implements a desired cellular function with quantitative precision is still lack. Model construction and simulation become more important as the size of genetic circuit grows. Therefore, computational models are used in our project for genetic circuit design and analysis. Fig. 1 The bacterial referee system has timer and counter functions in our model equation. Model equations\nBecause the memory modules (D and E strands) do not affect the system operation, we reduced our mathematical model as Fig. 1. It consists of six genes: LacI, LuxR, TetR, GFP-LVA, LuxI, and mRFP. Lactose and AHL are the input to the system. The fluorescence of the system, due to the protein GFP and mRFP, are the measured output. This system can be modeled by differential equations as fellows:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha-a, b, c and f are production rates of the corresponding promoter, which are assumed to be given constants. [Lact] is the concentration of added lactose and Alpha-out is the production rate of luxI protein that produced by the external bacteria which invading the system. The k1 is the degradation rate of lactose that consumed by bacteria. The k2 is the production rate of AHL that synthesized by the LuxI protein. Gamma-GFP, gamma-tetR, gamma-LuxI and gamma-RFP are decay rates of the corresponding proteins. Since the proteins are relatively stable, we neglected protein degradation rate and assumed that the degradation rate parameters were simply equal to the dilution rate corresponding to the observed division time of the cell (about 45 min) (Batt, 2007). The Hill function can be derived from considering the equilibrium binding of the transcription factor to its site on the promoter region. For a repressor of LacI and tetR protein, Hill function is an S-shaped curve which can be described in the form 1 / [ 1 + (x/Kr)^n ]. Kr is the repression coefficient. The Hill coefficient n governs the steepness of the input function.

The measurement of promoter activity.", "result": "?Result - Timer\n\n\nTimer Function\nA controllable bio-timer which can count variable time duration was constructed in our bacterial referee. The timer function is controlled by the Plac promoter (BBa_R0011), and the concentration of lactose determines timer\u0092s working length. Lactose was used to repress the LacI protein (BBa_C0012) and make the promoter Plac(BBa_R0011) express the down stream genes, cI434(BBa_C0052), tetR(BBa_C0040) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)(BBa_K145015) to implement the timer function. When added lactose is consumed by E. coli, the Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) start to translate and GFP is degraded. Therefore, the media turn from green color to yellow color (mixed color of green and red light), yellow color to red color step by step. The red color in the final step warns us that time\u0092s up and the product lose freshness. A key feature of the bio-timer is that make the longer timing function up to 8-20 hrs. Component Descriptions\nStrand A\nConstitutive promoter (BBa_J23106) always express the downstream genes, LacI and LuxR (BBa_C0062). LacI inhibits the activity of promoter PLac in the strand B. Complex which combines LuxR with AHL induce the expression of pcIIp22 (BBa_K145150) in strand F.\nStrand B\nIn the abscence of lactose, the LacI repressor binds to the promoter Plac(BBa_R0011) and prevents RNA polymerase bound to the promoter (Plac) from transcribing the dawnstream genes. When lactose enters the bacterium, it binds to the LacI repressor and causes a conformational change that inhibits its ability to bind DNA. Consequently, the promoter Plac can transcribe the daenstream genes. The cI repressor (BBa_C0052) inhibits the 434 cI-regulated promoter PcI434 (BBa_R0052) in the strand E.\nTetracycline repressor (BBa_C0040) inhibits the tetR-repressible promoter PtetR (BBa_R0040) in the strand C.\n\nPrinciple and Mechanism\nThe timer function in our bacterial referee has three stages:\nStandby phase: bacteria grow in lactose-free medium. Lactose-accession phase: lactose is added in medium. Lactose-consumption phase: bacteria eat all lactose, and the medium does not contain lactose. Standby stage: timer not start yet, and the medium is colorless \nFor our design, we use lactose as the activator for this bio-timer. When bacteria grow in lactose-free medium, the lacI (BBa_K091121) is produced by constitutive promoter and represses the Plac (BBa_K091110) promoter. In this condition, strand B does not work and also GFP?LVA is not expressed. During this time, E.coli does nothing but grow and cells in the medium are colorless. Lactose-accession phase: the medium is green\nWhile E.coli accumulates to the quantity we need (OD=0.1), we add lactose to start our bio-timer. After adding lactose, lactose removes the repression of LacI protein and LacI cannot repress the promoter PLac(BBa_K091110). When lactose is added in the medium, lactose binds with lacI (BBa_K091121) repressor and releases the inhibition of B strand, so the PlacI (BBa_K091110)promoter starts transcripting GFP-LVA (BBa_K145015). Then, the medium are green in this stage. Lactose-consumption phase: the medium is red\nFor our bio-timer, the concentration of lactose determines timer\u0092s working length. We need the nature function in E.coli which is the lactose operon and the operons are inherent in E.coli. When lactose exists, the lactose operon is induced for translating the three enzymes, lacZ, lacY and lacA, which are for the degradation of lactose into glucose. To sum up, the bio-timer start to count time after lactose addition and stop working when lactose totally is metabolized because of the lactose operon. When added lactose is consumed by E. coli, the RFP start to translate and GFP is degraded. Therefore, the medium turns from green color to yellow color (mixed color of green and red light), yellow color to red color step by step. The red color in the final step warns us that time\u0092s up. Present Achivements\nThe strand A (BBa_K188161) always express the downstream genes, LacI and LuxR (BBa_C0062) and strand B(BBa_K188261) always express the downstream genes, LacI and LuxR (BBa_C0062) were developed and sequenced. However, we do not have more time to keep on further experiments for testing. The experiments we plan to do are as follows:\nSince lactose is used as the repressor for LacI protein, the carbon source in the broth can not be glucose or any carbon source will be the priority of use to lactose. Therefore, we choose the glycerol as our carbon source in M9 medium for the experiment. Growth curve determination\nThe A and B strands are transformed to the host cells, and the cells are cultured in the M9 medium with glycerol as the carbon source to determine growth curve. Contribution of the curve between time and O.D. Therefore, the media turn from green color to yellow color (mixed color of green and red light), yellow color to red color step by step. Lactose-accession phase: lactose is added in medium. Lactose-consumption phase: bacteria eat all lactose, and the medium does not contain lactose. Lactose-accession phase: lactose is added in medium. Then, the medium are green in this stage. Lactose-accession phase: lactose is added in medium.
