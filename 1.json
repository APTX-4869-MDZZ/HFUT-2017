Cheng Kung University from 2016/08/08 to 2016/08/14.It\u0092s the first time for Tongji, a young iGEM team to join such an international conference, We get a opportunity to communicate with teams from Asia-pacific region.Thanks to Tongji Hospital, we could get the access to introduce iGEM and our project to the patients, and then we could communicate with them about their life as well.For us, it was a beginning and we are going to do more in the future.On Aug 16, 2016, with 3 other iGEM teams, we made an exhibition at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum.We shared some remarkable project that we had collected from all of the teams in the season of 2015 and some even before.More than 5000 people have seen our project, what\u0092s more, we had a good communication with other teams about our projects!Then we popularize scientific knowledge about synthetic biology and introduced the iGEM competition to them.The old team member, also known as the founder of IGEM in Tongji, shared their project at the year of 2014.Then they showed us around the campus and had a great lunch together.On Jun 19, 2016, we had a visit to NYU-Shanghai.What\u0092s more, we build a consensus that multidisciplinary cooperation could be better improved by involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competition.They are so young that they have some extraordinary ideas which surprised us a lot.Since our project is about tumor and its treatment, we want to know how will patients and citizens think of it.Afterwards, our team introduced the project this year, and have a heated discussion.In the end, we visited the NYU campus in Shanghai, then send farewell to each other.Some ideas were quite constructive and helpful to our improvement of the project, though most patients couldn t understand it well.IGEM was a fabulous stage and we did a lot of human practices.We introduced the iGEM competition by playing some both interesting and scientific videos to the people who visited the museum that day.Moreover, we made a colorful painting together to conclude our discussion results after the workshop.The Tongji 2016 iGEM team has been focusing on nowadays treatments of tumor worldwide and how to improve the current photothermal therapy using synthetic biology.We truly believed that by this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, we, as well as all the other teams are able to have communications, achieving better results.All 4 teams introduced their own projects, received some suggestions from others, and our friendship has been improved.Course with No.2 Middle School Affiliated to TongjiOn Sep 30, 2016, 168 grade 10 students from No.2 Middle School Affiliated to Tongji University spent a day visiting the Tongji University campus.We are proudly invited by National Yang-Ming University, an active iGEM team to have a visit in Taipei in August.IGEM is a great platform to start, and there is a long way to go.We not only considered project suggestions and perfected our projects but made friends with each other as well.Our team is found on Nov 19, 2015, 2 months before Team SJTU2016 is found.Meanwhile, we received plenty of constructive advice from our audience, especially experienced related scholars, which help us to optimize our cancer therapy design.To improve commutation experience, we had a \u0093World Caf\u00e9\u0094 Workshop focus on environmental protect and youth social responsibility.", "modeling": "We use a classical pharmacokinetic model to build a drug concentration forecasting function to describe the drug time-dependent concentration change trend, which could be a reference for pharmaceutical research.I.After taking drug, the change rate of drug concentration in body can be expressed as the dynamics equations:where x(t) is the drug concentration in body fluids, As r10(t) is proportional to the x(t), there is another formula:II.Comparing experiment data and model fitted data, we find the model are in good agreement with experiments results.It s necessary to monitor the variation of drug concentration in Body TissueBased on medical dynamics theory, we build a mathematical model to describe the drug time-dependent concentration change trend.According to knowledge of pharmacology, absorption rate of drug in proportion to the amount of drug that are not absorbed;the elimination rate in proportion to the drug concentration in body fluids, there is another formula: After several mathematical derivation, we get the model function to describe concentration in body tissue.We used a set of experiment data to conduct verification of our model.And we get the drug concentration change trend in a few hours.Based the experiment data, we use a classical non-linear model to build a differential equation and solve it, estimating the return model parameter from the experimental data by ordinary least squares method.We believe our mathematic model, which gives a description of drug concentration change in body tissue, is able to be biological universal and reasonable for many cases.Using this model, we can determine the drug concentration in blood from mathematical theory for various kinds of drug and different conditions.", "notebook": "[3]We get AuNRs with an aspect ratio of~3.9(41.9 \u00d7 10.6 nm), the transmission electron microscopy(TEM) image is shown as figure1(a),the TEM image clearly indicates that the products are single crystals and the shape is quite even.As to the AuNRs with the aspect ratio of 3.9, two LSPR peaks at 546 and 770 nm are observed (figure 1(b)).The former arises from the transverse resonant oscillation, while the latter results from the resonant oscillation[1], the LSPR range of the AuNRs is wide in near infrared region.The temperature variation of the GNRs is revealed by irradiating a 200?l aqueous solution using an 808 nm laser.In addition, as the laser power density increases, the temperature increment is higher, because more energy is absorbed by the solution (figure 1(d)).Figure 1(e) shows that the top temperature is almost unchanged after four cycles, which indicates the photothermal stability of GNRs.Then, the precipitate would back to black.Mix Co-520(0.1mL), cyclohexane(6.0mL) and UCNPs(4.0mL, 0.01M dissolved in cyclohexane) and stir for 10min.Add absolute ethyl alcohol(2.0mL), GQDs(100?L), TEOS(0.04mL) and stir at 600rpm for 2 days.Add acetone until the solution becomes cloudy and centrifugate at 6000rpm for 10min.Scrub the precipitate by the mixture of deionized water and ethanol(volume ratio is 1:1) 2 times and store in deionized water.Part4 photothermal property of integrative materialWe test the photothermal property of UCNPs, UCNPs with SiO2 and GQDs, UCNPs with SCC, GQDs, SCCat irradiation of 670nm and 980nm laser separately to confirm that the thermal effect is mainly caused by the SCC absorbing 670nm laser converted via UCNPs absorbing 980nm laser.GNRs are synthesized through the seedless growth route.We irradiate the GNRs solution from an ambient temperature to the top temperature for consecutive four cycles, testing whether the top temperature will change or not.In our experiment, we use poly ethylene glycol (PEG) to minimized dose-related side effects of single AuNRs.The treatment is mixing prepared AuNRs with PEG and leaving undisturbed at room temperature for 24h.We test the AuNRs at different power density.Third, we test the photothermal stability of the AuNRs.(c)The temperature incrementwith different concentration of AuNRs.The power density of the 808 nm laser is fixed at 2.80W/cm2.(e)The temperature variation of 19.2 ?g/ml AuNRs suspension as irradiated by the 1.80 W/cm2 808 nm laser for four cycles.Find the ideal gene p53 ,promoters of hTert and HSP.(d)The temperature increment with three different laser power density.The concentration of the AuNRs is 100 ?g/ml.The photothermal stability test result indicates that the AuNRs exhibits excellent photothermal stability.The temperature increases obviously(figure 1(c)) as the increase of the GNRs concentration.(a)The TEM image of the AuNRs.[2]The concentration and material volume are listed as following: The as-synthesized AuNRs is purified by three cycles of centrifugation to remove excessive Au ions.Our results show that with the surface modification of PEG, the toxicity of the AuNRs decreased dramatically.After vigorous stirring at room temperature for 15 min, the colloidal solution weretransferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 200 \u00b0C for 8h.The systems were then allowed to naturally cool to room temperature.And the cell toxicity experiment shows that the toxicity of the AuNRs is dose-related.When the AuNRs concentration is low, it doesn\u0092t show obvious cell toxicity, but it exhibits cell toxicity with the concentration increase.Then, 2.0mL of deionized water contained 4 mmol of NaF was dropwise added to the mixture.An ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer) is applied for measuring the ratio of reacted HAuCl4.First, we test UV\u0096vis-NIR extinction spectra of the AuNRs.Second, we test the photothermal effect of the AuNRs.These results indicate that the GNRs synthesized by us possess good photothermal property and stability.The cell toxicity is the result of the AuNRs caninduce cell apoptosis and autophagy by damaging mitochondria and activating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS).Mix I is the mixture of MnCl2(0.5mL, 0.5M), Yb(NO3)3(0.9mL,0.2M), Er(NO3)3(0.1mL, 0.2M), Y(NO3)3(1.1mL, 0.5M) and the mix II is the mixture of NaOH(0.3g), deionized water (1.5 mL), oleicacid (5 mL) and ethanol (10 mL).Then add AgNO3 aqueous solution slowly with stirring, followed by AA aqueous solution, and stop stirring when the solution is transparent.", "protocol": "", "result": "Therefore, we proved that the AuNRs used in this study do not cause any acute cytotoxic effect or aggregation during ciculaiton in in vivo applications.Co-transfected GFP for the data analysis of laser experiment could be obviously seen from the cell.To make the analysis of cell survival rate more accurate, a GFP plasmid was co-transfected into the cell, we could get the efficiency of transfection by FACS.Our part require hTERT promoter to reach specifically targeting, so we have designed experiment to illustrate that the part works as we expected.Discussion: From the picture can we conclude that the hTERT promoter is working only in telomerase expressed cells, this promoter can be used as tumor specific promoter for downstream gene expression.Now that we have proved that the hTERT promoter is working, we need to further illustrate that hsp promoter will work.Most tumor cells don\u0092t have high expression of p53 protein in general because the gene is inhibited or mutated.But we are glad to have see some fantastic changes.The six-day tumor volume shows that after infected hsp-p53 and hTERT-p53, the tumors are more likely to be depressed.Without NIR, the plasmids hsp-p53 and hTert-p53 is relatively harmless.We use p53 as downstream gene instead of GFP, and run western blot to check if the P53 protein will express higher when heated.With AuNRs and NIR, the depression is enhanced.The transmission electron microscopy(TEM) image is shown as figure1(a),the TEM image clearly indicates that the products are single crystals and the shape is relatively even.As to the AuNRs with the aspect ratio of 3.9, two LSPR (Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance) peaks respectively at 546 and 770 nm are observed (figure 1(b)).The former arises from the transverse resonant oscillation, while the latter results from the longitudinal resonant oscillation[1].The LSPR range of the AuNRs is wide in near infrared region.The temperature variation of the AuNRs is revealed by irradiating a 200?l aqueous solution using an 808 nm laser.The temperature increases obviously(figure 1(c)) as AuNRs concentrationmounting.In addition,as the laser power density grows,the temperature increment is higher, because more energy is absorbed by the solution (figure 1(d)).Figure 1(e) shows that the top temperature is almost unchanged after four cycles, which indicates the photothermal stability of AuNRs.These results indicate that the AuNRs synthesized by us possess good photothermal property and stability.The results shows that AuNRs do not affect the metabolic activities of the cells up to 100?l/mg..And they are stably dispersed in serum-containing medium without aggregation.It is likely that the system we developed actually work in vivo experiment.This experiment suggests that the plasmids actually improve the efficiency of killing cancer cells.As time is limited, the vivo experiment is still in the progress.", "safety": "All the risk level organism is treated with sterile liquid to avoid causing harm to the environment.The cell toxicity experime nt shows that the toxicity of the AuNRs is dose-related.Before we freshmen get into the lab and do experiments, we must take some courses offered by Administrative office of Laboratory and Equipment and have several tests to qualify our safety training on the Tongji University website.1)Experiment participants need to understand the experiment completely.3)Necessary steps should be performed in bio-safety cabinet.4)Fire, electric heaters, microwave oven should not be left while being used.5)Sterilize all liquid waste and solid waste containing living organism.7)The last person to leave the lab should make sure that water, electricity, gas, and air conditioner has been closed, and doors and windows has been locked before leaving.Even though all the organism we work with are not harmful for the environment and health, we still assume that they may threaten the ecology, so we wear rubber gloves and lab coat when we do the experiments to keep it from direct touching with human body.In the experiment, we use spirit lamp to provide a microorganism-free environment.Fig.5 the waste liquid is treated with sterile liquid to avoid causing harm to the environment.In our project, we use 6 kinds of organism, hcc1997,hela and 293T cell line plus virus ranked in the organisms of Level 2 risk group, while E.coli which is ranked in the organisms of Level 1 risk goup and the mouse which is kept in SPF level.Fig1.most of our work is finished in the laminar benchFig.2 most of our equipment has been treated by high-pressure steam sterilization.Fig.3 the cells we used in our experiment is tested as mycoplasma free.Fig.4 we used the UV light to sterilize the laminar bench everytime before and after our experiment.And our results show that with the surface modification of PEG, the toxicity of the AuNRs decreased dramatically.When the AuNRs concentration is low, it shows no obvious cell toxicity, but it exhibits cell toxicity with the concentration increase.The cell toxicity is the result of the AuNRs can induce cell apoptosis and autophagy by damaging mitochondria and activating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1].After we do the experiments, we use NaclO solution to

company, and customized microfluidics chips and case of the device according to our design.Team member of ZJU-China are responsible of almost all the issues involved in the project, and they did a great job!Lu Ye gave us lots of advices on art design.", "background": "", "description": "We are a team full of creative thoughts, and all kinds of interesting ideas generate every day.", "design": "In order to make input more easily, we add a simple NOT gate after PompC promoter which is consisted of protein cl and P lamda, and can change this system into being activated by red light and being inhibited by dark.Through these two TCS, the information which is in binary form can be inputted conveniently.For better effects, we hope each of the encryption unit could change dynamically, that is, for the same input signal at different times, our system will produce different responses, and this change is a periodic process.In practice, If the period of the oscillation system is 1.5h, suppose we irradiate three tubes of bacteria using red light, green light, red light at 14:00 in the afternoon, we can get the feedback of green light (GFP), red light (RFP), red light (RFP), which are the encrypted cipher-text.Then the bacteria will continue oscillation but we could not know their states.(When the mouse is out, it s \"invert\" operation, when the mouse is in, it s \"remain\")\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To realize an independent and dynamic encryption, we use logic gates to combine the light control system and the oscillation system.Match these promoters together with fluorescence protein reporter gene, we can get four AND gate circuits:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When bacteria are expressing AHL, PluxR is turned on continuously, and the inputting optical signal is changed into another light of different color.Using light-switchable two-component systems as input, and AND gate circuit to manipulate the input signal, we have already achieved the basic function of the cipher machine.Also, we want to adopt the blue light control system used by Uppsala_Sweden2011, and compare its influences with red light and green light systems.For realizing synchronization as a whole, besides quorum sensing substances, we hope to apply a new micromolecule which could penetrate the PDMS surface, and coordinate bacteria\u0092s gene expression process.Use GFP as the reporter gene, we can observe a stable oscillation (Fig.3c).Danino T, Mondr6ag\u00f3n-Palomino O, Tsimring L, et al.When we need to decrypt, irradiate them using green light, red light, red light at 15:30, the bacteria will return to their original states, emitting red light, green light and red light which means we get the original text.Thus, with the adjustment by the oscillation system, the second generation of cipher machine could change periodically between two different code books all by itself.Using AHL to activate the production of H2O2 in chambers, letting H2O2 to coordinate gene expression in the whole unit, we then realize a perfect synchronization in the whole unit.In the future, we plan to increase the light intensity, to explore the correlation between light intensity and bacteria\u0092s response time.But when doing an experiment, we could not realize a stable oscillation because of the continuous split of bacteria and the accumulation of autoinducers.We have achieved information input using light control system, and have decided the transformational rule using oscillation system.After combined with chromophore ho1 and pcyA, ccaS could absorb green light around 520nm wavelength long, and thus, its own phosphate group will transfer, resulting in the phosphorylation of ccaR, an intracellular protein.Through redox signalling by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the native redox sensing machineries of E. Coli, we can apply H2O2 to our oscillation system (Fig.11).When we make two amber mutations on T7ptag, the process of protein translation will be inhibited.In the light control system, there has Plamada promoter and PcpcG2 promoter.In order to describe the light control system more in details, we plan to use multi-mode reading machine to take pictures regularly.Using this technology, we can keep the quantity of bacteria at a certain level and take the accumulated autoinducers away, making the system a better coupling and could operate steadily.So we will do the following experiments for further optimization of the system.We use gene lux l as gene A, and it can encode luxl protein which is AHL synzyme; we use gene aiiA as gene B, and it can encode aiiA protein which is AHL clastic enzyme.Gram-negative bacteria has two kinds of quorum sensing system, and the autoinducers are AHL (Fig.2a) and DPD (Fig.2b).When using hydrogen peroxide as diffusion molecule in oscillation system, we need to modify the microfluidics device.Among bacteria, due to the differences between individuals, we can hardly observe a group-level stable oscillation.Similar to the green-light system, in the red-light system, phosphate group is transferred from membrane protein Cph8 (also needs the combination with chromophore ho1 and pcyA) to intracellular protein PompC, activating PompC promoter.In the oscillation system, there has Plsr promoter and PluxR promoter.Quorum sensing is a system of autoinducers released by bacteria themselves and response correlated to population density to regulate group behaviors like gene expression.And then, if we let another quorum sensing substance -- gene DPD express with gene aiiA together (Fig.4a), the phase difference between the concentration curve of DPD and AHL is also half a period.During the experiment, we integrated the two plasmids mentioned in the original reference into a whole.Therefore, the concentration of A or B will increase and decrease periodically, and the phase difference of these two extremes is half a period.However, after being irradiated by red light around 650nm wavelength long, the phosphorylation transfer process (from ccaS to ccaR) will be inhibited.For example, irradiating with red light will turn on Plamda, resulting in the emission of green light (GFP).The substance A can arouse promoter Pa+, resulting in the expression of gene B; And the product B will inhibit the activity of promoter Pb-.In the future, we plan to change the copy numbers and try to find the best effect.By using this difference, we could segment another period (Fig.4b).Using this system, optical signal can be used as input, and can be received by engineered E.coli.During the decreasing concentration of AHL, the expression of aiiA will decrease too.The main principle we use in the AND gate is using tRNA to identify amber mutation.We suspect that the incoordination happened in the system is due to different copy numbers.In the green-light system, ccaS protein is fixed on the cell membrane.In practice, in order to merge several chambers into a whole encryption unit, we have to realize synchronization among chambers instead of within a single one.Nature, 2012, 481(7379):39-44.Nature, 2010, 463(7279): 326-330.The following problem is how to combine these two systems together and we design an AND gate.The effect using red light system to inhibit PopmC is not obvious enough.These two systems are green-light system (CcaS-CcaR system) and red-light system (Cph8-OmpR system).As a cipher machine, it must have the ability to input information conveniently.And on a PDMS chip, we need to distinguish different encryption units because each unit has its own oscillation state.After inputting exogenetic tRNA into E.coli, whose feature is to identify amber mutation, these two promoters controlling T7ptag and tRNA have composed the input of AND gate.In order to solve this problem, we use micro-fluid technology (Fig.5a).For double-period oscillation, we need to find another substance that can be compared with hydrogen peroxide molecules, which requires our further efforts.From the previous data, the phase difference between the concentration of aiiA and AHL is half a period.", "human_practice": "We intended to call for the public\u0092s attention through our attractive project and use their feedback to improve it and the way we tell the story of synthetic biology.We were invited there as one of the lecturers, and one of the team members gave an interesting speech about synthetic biology and our project.However, the feedback from the people of the organization were centered on the way we introduced the project and synthetic biology.We are inspired by those sincere feedback, and try to improve our project and the way we introduce it.And we are very pleased to know that the idea of synthetic biology is valued by most of the public from the dialogue.And we decided to use less proper nouns while talking to the old and emphasis on the success that synthetic biology have achieved, in order to make them feel freer and easier to accept the idea.So we designed a software version and a mechanical version (using circuit board) of the biological cipher machine and use it to introduce our project to the public.After the first trial speech, we got to know that our speech contented too much proper noun, which may make it difficult for the general public to understand.We carefully explained the safety problem synthetic biology concerned to the old, and realized it is the first problem that synthetic biology should settled down, in order to apply it to reality.We used room escape game, decoding game using cadies as props, and a video telling a story based on synthetic biology to attract their attention and introduced synthetic biology to the public.And they also suggested us to split the proper noun from the main content, since the concept itself is very new, and it may take some time for them to understand.In addition to what we have done to meet the requirements of the silver medal, we attended a national famous experience sharing activity in China, ONEYOUTH Talk.This activity was organized by a local youth organization, Huyou tower in Chongqing, China, and it is a part of the weekly activities there.Design of the biological machine determines the upper limit of the project, and lab work determines the lower limit of the project.As for human practice work, it views iGEM and synthetic biology in a broader perspective, which is close to the exploration of social value and describes a bigger world that synthetic biology and iGEM exist.And the kids\u0092 curiosity for synthetic biology was sparked(though they may not know the whole meaning).When we first gave the speech to them through the Internet, those who have studied biology, math and engineering find it easy to understand.What\u0092s more, we found that our methods of attracting attention were useful, but it seemed that we need some other methods to help us to explain the project and synthetic biology.In order to confirm the effect of the activity, we started to get contact with people of that organization one month and a half before the activity was held.These feedbacks are the epitome of wonder and concern about synthetic biology.We are very glad to give the public an impression that they can also engage in the biology field.And when the presentation was over, many people talked to us, and gave some valuable feedbacks, which inspired us to improve the design and execution of our project.And integrate our HP work with the design of the project, which is really exciting.However, the project manager, who is a designer, thought it a little confusing.And a series of postcards with codes that could be deciphered with the software came out, too.In order to describe this \u0093bigger world\u0094 better, ZJU-China has been tried hard to collect the voices outside the lab and integrate the investigated issue into the design and the execution of our project.There was also a fair in the location of the Talk for people to sell some interesting made by themselves, and local people would like to go there for entertainment.It was a very long and tiring process, since we had to communicate with the organizers from time to time, and give the speech in advance.Since the audience focused more on the content itself, their feedbacks were centered on the feasibility of the project.Using a software which had a same principle of our Enigma machine, the information can be easily decoded.He was rather astonished that his advice can be taken, since he thought the public can only accept those information from the scientists.We cut up the proper nouns and focus more on the idea, which is proved to be successful.And set up a stall in the exhibition hall.And we do make up a story to make the project to be more interesting and easy to be accepted.", "modeling": "Therefore,basing on the biological reaction process above, we derived the following set of delay-differential equation model for intracellular concentrations of LuxI (I),AiiA (A), internal AHL (Hi), and external AHL (He)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the equation?1??2?,P(???) represents the Hill function\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0describes the delayed production of corresponding proteins, it depends on the past concentration of the internal AHL, and ? is the time delay.Therefore, we through modeling of the external AHL concentration, the results can be used to characterize the fluorescence intensity.The micro fluid in the main channel of the microfluidic chip will take the external AHL off, which we have built in the penetration model.In the equation (3), AHL synthetase is encoded by luxI and aiiA with LAA degradation tag is controlled by pluxR promoter and aiiA encodes the enzyme catalyzing AHL to degradation.Through the preliminary experiment, we can see that the bacteria concentration of fluorescent protein expression of AHL and the strength of bacteria is positively correlated.Also, the internal AHL will diffuse into the extracellular space because of the difference of the concentration of AHL inside and outside with the diffusion coefficient D0.The factor d/(1 ? d) comes from the total mass conservation of AHL inside and outside the cells.By consulting relevant literatures and measuring in our experiment, we get most of the coefficients in the differential equation above and solve the equations in Matlab.The equation (4) describes the external AHL concentration outside the cells.The last term in equation for He describes the diffusion of external AHL.In our model, the trap is considered a unit, so it is meaningless for us to calculate this term

Jinshi Ran, Hongya Zhu\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For better description of single oscillation system, we measured the response intensity of pluxR to

0.075% Tween20 which prevented cells from adhering to the main channels and waste ports.", "protocol": "", "result": "Next, after co-transformation with bacteria, we can verify the response time of the integrated system (light-induced + logic gate), and thus, verify the cipher machine\u0092s basic function in its first generation.Due to time limit, we measured the green light system and the red light system without the NOT gate.Thus, we estimate that the response time of logic gate is around 2 hours.After the single-period oscillation was proved, we tried to test the double-period oscillation system.And then couple these systems together: the light-induced system, the logic gate system, and the oscillation system.However, after comparing our data of these two oscillation systems without microfluidics condition, we can speculate that in the microfluidics chip, the stable double-period oscillation can be realized.(3)Integrate with the light-induced system, and the oscillation system, to verify the function of Enigma.We have already constructed a plasmid (Bba_K1886010?Bba_K1886011?Bba_K1886012?Bba_K1886013) for Enigma.3?Mix bacteria of the green light and red light system together, and measure their response towards light.As the absorbance value (shown in the left figure) indicates the amount of bacteria, we can make sure that the increasing of fluorescence intensity is not caused by the bacteria growth.After then, we have tested the light sensitivity and the response time.Due to the limited time, we did not realize double-period oscillation.After coupling with the light-induced system, the overall response time can be matched up with the oscillation period.(2)Integrate with the light-induced system to verify the cipher machine\u0092s function (first generation).We have already constructed a plasmid using light-induced promoter to replace an existent one.Through these experiments, we can also conclude under which concentration can the AND gate have the best effect.Due to the inequality of these two circuits, we have constructed a plasmid (Bba_K1886016) to change the position of plac and pbad promoters.Seeing from the figure, we could find the oscillation was stable enough.We have figured out the relationship between pluxR and AHL, and our next step was inserting single-period oscillation system into MG1655, verifying the oscillation system.Also, the green light system is more stable than the other one.We simplified the three-plasmid AND gate system based on our reference by constructing all the segments in one plasmid.However, compared with our reference, we did not test the obvious constraint on the red light.Seeing from the right figure, with the increase of the inducers\u0092 concentration, the fluorescence intensity also increases.1.Realize the double-period oscillation system in the microfluidics chip.When reaching OD0.1, we took out 1ml sample every 10 minutes, diluting to the same OD value and measuring the fluorescence intensify.When reaching OD0.1, we took out 1ml sample every 10 minutes, diluting to the same OD value and measuring the fluorescence intensify.2?Future measurement of the red light system after inserting NOT gate.To describe the single-period oscillation system in a better and more precise way, we measured pluxR promoter\u0092s response states towards AHL of different concentration.Following are the possible reasons:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01?The results can be affected by the copy number of plasmid and the replicon\u0092s intensity, especially for the red light TCS.In the light-induced system, the reporter gene\u0092s leak will affect our measurement.We have successfully constructed plasmid used in the light-induced system and achieved co-transformation in E.coli JT2.Following is the relational graph of fluorescence intensity and the concentration of AHL (fig2).2.When measuring the fluorescence expression of bacteria after co-transformation, the results are affected by medium.As is shown in the figure, solutions with no inducers or only one inducer can produce little GFP fluorescence which verify the precision and feasibility of the AND gate.However, the fluorescence intensity of the group with no inducers flattens after 2 hours.1.When measuring fluorescence intensity, the first step is to do re-suspension.We found that after adding arabinose and IPTG, the fluorescence intensity satisfies a linear growth curve.Also, we did two parallel experiments for each gradient, and measured the fluorescence intensity.Keep balance between every components by changing the copy number of plasmid and the replicon\u0092s intensity.Although we observed periodic oscillation, it became unstable gradually due to the increase of bacteria quantity and the accumulation of AHL.3.When using microfluidics device, don\u0092t forget to add Tween20 of 0.075% in the medium to avoid bacteria being stuck in the chip.We measured the sample every certain period after adding inducers, and make the response curves in the figure.(4) The result of co-transformation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We can conclude that under ultraviolet, bacteria would emit green fluorescence.Thirdly, the logic gate plasmid is relatively large and according to the references, the tRNA we used is toxic and may cause damage to the cell.1.We use MG1655 as the chassis, which contains the Lac operon system and Arabinose operon system.Our next step is to verify its function in the microfluidics device.We did four parallel experiments: the bacteria solutions were added by IPTG of 10^-4mol/L, arabinose of 10^-3mol/L, both of them, and neither of them.We used arabinose promoter (PBAD) and lactose promoter (Plac) as two inputs and we have verified the corresponding response concentration and time.We observed that the sharp increase of fluorescence mainly happens after 3 hours.After being cultivated for a whole night, the co-transformation bacteria was transferred into the 100 ml LB medium with the proportion of 1:1000.After being cultivated for a whole night, the co-transformation bacteria was transferred into the 100 ml LB medium with the proportion of 1:1000.If you use a strain does not contain these systems, you need to add the corresponding repressor protein into the circuit when constructing plasmid .2?Maybe this is because the LED intensity was not strong enough.We found that pluxR began to be activated when the concentration of AHL was about 10^-9M, and began to saturate when AHL was about 10^-6M.This may because the leak of Pbad.Following is the result (fig5).Following is the result (fig4a).Following is the result (fig3).Only the protein T7ptag can activate the gene controlled by T7 promoter, though T7ptag has two amber mutations, some E.coli endogenous tRNA may also identify the stop codon, which causes the leaking of Pbad seemingly.Also, it had the corresponding AHL and the ability to express sfGFP.In order to avoid such errors, we have several alternative plans:Use a new light-induced system - we have already found a system using blue light.2.Make sure A600nm is more than 0.3 before you add sugar into the bacteria solution.When the volume fraction falls below 10%, we did not observe obvious differences.Also, we used LB medium and it absorbed light of different wavelength, making light attenuate too much and could not activate TCS effectively.Next, we designed experiments to verify the response concentration.We measured our system\u0092s ability to produce fluorescence signal under different conditions of light.3.Explore the relationship between velocity of flow and the length of each period.Secondly, we integrate the logic gate input and output parts together in a single plasmid.By using PCR and one step cloning, we removed luxl gene (fig1a, fig1b), and thus the plasmid, pTD103luxI-sfGFP, was mutant.3.Note that LB has very high absorbance, when you detect the fluorescence intensity you\u0092d better use PBS to suspend bacteria.But after a series of experiments, we could observe stable differences both after irradiated by light and in the dark.After comparing the results being induced by no AHL and AHL of 10^-6M, we verified we had successfully removed luxl gene in function.", "safety": "No matter which strain escape from the system, the gene for toxalbumin will be expressed and kill the escaped bacteria, and thus ensure the safety (but due to time constraints, we have not achieved the suicide switch yet).?Close-toed shoes and pants must be worn at all times in the lab, and gloves whenever working at the bench.? Hands must be washed before leaving the lab area.Before getting the permission into the lab, we must pass the safety examination online.Different areas have different rules, for example, in the GEL AREA, we have to wear double layers of gloves to protect ourselves from the toxic nucleic acid dyes.?

sterically hinders RNAP action, thus inhibiting transcription.In a classical biologic circuit, the transistor is composed of a promoter regulating an output gene.Therefore we had to prove the activation/inhibition results we obtained were reproducible with a mutated version of the promoter.Thanks to their similarity, dCas9-? - sgRNA complexes behave in an homogeneous fashion, and the specificity of the gRNA prevents cross-talk between different transistors.Figure 1 shows the GFP level is increased when placing dCas9-? on the activating position (A).We changed the inhibitory and activating sequences on the promoter along with associated gRNAs.This could be explained by the great tightness of J23117 promoter (link Interlab) and by a small leakage due to the presence of the subunit.Fig.2 - On the left-hand side, fluorescence between the initial and mutated promoters was compared.This is probably due to leakage from the upstream promoter, as repressing the upstream promoter (R_u) resulted in lower fluorescent output.We saw a clear decrease of fluorescence compared to the fully activated state.Currently, genetic circuits reproducing digital logic are limited in the multiplication and chaining of logic elements as each step requires a different signaling molecule.We notice that the basal expression of the downstream reporter J23117_alt in chained configuration (B_d) is higher than the basal expression of regular J23117_alt (B_alt).Our team therefore confirmed following features: To verify induction and repression by dCas9-?, we targeted a GFP controlling promoter once with an activating sgRNA and once with an inhibitory one.At an optimal distance upstream from the transcriptional starting site (TSS), the w subunit recruits RNAP activating the transcription of the associated gene.Recognition of the target sequence is mediated by a guide RNA (gRNA) moiety.Basal levels for each promoter as well as negative control (autofluorescence) were also provided.We fused dCas9 to a RNA Polymerase (RNAP) recruiting element, the ?

question \u0093Does a sufficient interaction exist between the general public and scientists?\u0094 from Lausanne and Basel was very similar (around 25% of positive answers), highschool students were more categorical (less than ten percent of positive answers).This encouraged us to further investigate the issue of interaction in scientific research in our main article.Since we believed to have observed a link between the question \u0093Are you favourable to engineered wheat strains that easily adapt to climatic conditions ?\u0094 and the one asking \u0093What is your opinion on GMOs ?\u0094 during our public survey in Lausanne, we decided to compare the overall answers to the two questions.Some specialists insisted on the necessity of moratoriums, as they allow scientists to avoid making disastrous mistakes in the future and keep working in line with ethics: \u0093I think that the word of caution made by these scientists matches with a broad consensus in the scientific community: we do not wish to modify the human germline in any way\u0094, Prof. Trono affirms, also reminding us that the question of human genome manipulation is not a new one.The answers were enthusiastic, with a vast majority of \u0093rather positive\u0094.>One of the striking results of this survey came from one of the last questions of our survey: \u0093What is your opinion on GMOs (or Genetically Modified Organisms)?\u0094, to which we mostly got \u0093Rather negative\u0094 as an answer.We thought it was interesting to compare the results of these two diagrams, as they seem to reflect the misconception people have about the word GMO.Such position requires the scientist to step back from his everyday research and from his own interests in order to get an overall view of the situation, which, as Prof Fran\u00e7ois Lefort, biologist and member of the Parliament of the State of Geneva underlines, is not easy: \u0093One must bear in mind that a scientist does not only work to discover things, even if that is exciting [...]\u0094, he told us, \u0093But he then has to take the necessary time to understand and reflect upon his discovery, to realize whether it is dangerous or not.[1] Federal popular

for this day was to get this mindset across to highschool students.Other examples are the DIY biohacker spaces that are burgeoning outside institutions, such as the \u0093Hackuarium\u0094, a Lausanne-based bio-hacker community with which last year\u0092s EPFL iGEM team collaborated [3].If communication and more importantly interaction between scientists and the general public appears to be essential, another big question comes to the mind: which stance should the scientist adopt in the discussion process?The results showed mixed feelings, and many people took some time to think before answering.As mentioned above, we also submitted the survey to passerbys in Basel (in collaboration with the ETHZ iGEM team) and to Vaud highschool students (following the \u0093biology and chemistry\u0094 option) before they visited us for the Highschool day.The first defence line is people [scientists] like you\u0094, Prof. Lefort insists.Another way the media address the matter of responsibility in Science is by invoking \u0093playing God\u0094, a very strong symbol (which goes back to the polemical way some media cover scientific topics), and can be understood as \u0093not respecting what God gave us by modifying the genome\u0094.If the answer was no, we provided him/her with the following Wikipedia definition: \u0093Synthetic biology is a scientific field combining biology and engineering in order to design and build (synthesize) new biologic systems and units\u0094.Instead, we tried to highlight the different opinions we encountered during these interviews and help sketch the landscape of science communication in our country.In order to assess how the general public perceives the field of synthetic biology, we designed a survey that we submitted to people passing by a stand we held in the streets of Lausanne.\u0093I believe that publicly speaking about risks - if scientists ever agree on a way to do it - could be a good opportunity to build trust with the general public\u0094, she continues, stressing that a constant race for spectacular innovation is not the only way forward in science.\u0093It has to be taught to researchers during their training\u0094, Prof. Benaroyo affirms, \u0093A researcher has to be able to step back and question his own work\u0094.Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 has generated a heated debate on the way it could be used in gene therapy, which has led us to investigate the issue of the responsibility of the outcomes of scientific research.The role of ethics committees is to make assessments, after having addressed the issues in a protocolar way, but not to lead a public debate between different parties.It seems very difficult for us to give any definite answer to the questions we asked about communication, interaction and responsibility in Science.Despite this perception of lack of communication, the media coverage of science in Western Switzerland seems adequate according to Prof. Didier Trono, researcher at EPFL and former Dean of the Faculty of Life Sciences: \u0093I believe that a lot of effort is made in order inform the general public\u0094, he told us, furthermore underlining the large offer of media content available in the region, including daily national radio shows and weekly TV shows.But all this is definitely not easy in a one-way communication context\u0094.The remark about the existence of a \u0093one-way communication context\u0094 leads to the issue of the interaction between scientists and the general public.From this assumption, a solution would be to not even be discussing those \u0093off target effects\u0094 until they are resolved by the researchers.We also noted a tendency for scientists to expect ethicists to give clear answers to questions like \u0093are we allowed to continue doing such or such experiment?\u0094 which is in fact a misconception about the function of ethics in such issues.\u0093There is unfortunately no room in mainstream media to talk about science and the actual process of research: how research works, where the money comes from, how papers are reviewed and published\u0094, regrets Aur\u00e9lie Coulon, \u0093Such subjects only show little interest to the Editor-In-Chief, except in the case of a great fraud.Their lack of enthusiasm with respect to the minesweeper game reminded us that we were 90s kids...Our first conclusion to this series of surveys, is that there is a clear feeling among the general public that interaction between them and scientists is insufficient.\u0093Ethics\u0094 trailed by a few answers.One result we found interesting was the relatively low number of \u0091National security\u0092 answers.Research in synthetic biology could have come to an end had the 1998 federal popular initiative \u0093for the protection of life and the environment against gene manipulations (initiative for genetic protection)\u0094 been accepted.We also noted the unpopularity of the word \u0093GMO\u0094, which contrats with the popularity of synthetic biology and most of its applications.Research in synthetic biology could have come to an abrupt end had the 1998 had the federal popular initiative - \u0093for the protection of life and the environment against genetic manipulation (initiative for genetic protection)\u0094 - been accepted.\u0093I believe that interacting with the public and participating in the information process is part of the scientist\u0092s responsibility\u0094, he says, \u0093It is a central matter.\u0093Science should be discussed more often in the street, with the public\u0094 or \u0093Scientists should make an effort\u0094 were recurring comments.[...] It is a matter of survival\u0094.We also asked Prof. Lazare Benaroyo, ethicist and researcher at the University of Lausanne, about the position of the scientist in the information process.It is a societal dialogue, and this role is claimed by ethics committees \u0096 I\u0092m thinking about the National Academy of Sciences in the USA for instance \u0096 that aim to represent society as a whole\u0094.To begin with our investigations of the issues of communication, interaction and responsibility in scientific research, we began by surveying the general public.However, we have to mention that many students left a comment next to the answer of the second question, stating that using GMOs requires caution both on a technical and economic level.The collected opinions concerning the practical examples of organisms designed with synthetic biology were especially different among the three audiences we surveyed for the 3 applications seen below.Throughout the day, we did our best to show these students a different side of the field of biology and convince them that we can hack life!We welcomed the students with a presentation that consisted of three parts.We could be more imaginative in the programs we design for schools and for the public in general\u0094.Despite the variety and abundance of information available for the general public, the overall feeling that interaction is insufficient remains .This may be due to the fact that information alone is not sufficient to create interaction, as it only goes one way.The first salient result of our survey was that people reacted very differently to the subject of synthetic biology depending on whether the acronym GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) was present or not in the question they were asked.According to Xavier Gavend, the responsibility stemming from research might be too much for a human being to bear.Another way to discuss a breakthrough technology, how it should or should not be used, consists in declaring a moratorium, meaning that all research involving the specific technology is interrupted until a general agreement is found between researchers and all other stakeholders.This analysis brings up another issue: scientists do not learn how to discuss their field of research with the general public and other experts such as humanities specialists.We discussed these results with the experts we interviewed: you can read about it in our main article.The next thing we wanted to know was whether or not the subject felt that the interaction between the scientific world and the general public was satisfactory.In addition, a majority of them were favorable to the use of GMOs, which was neither the case for the general public in Lausanne nor in Basel.While favorable opinions on \u0093Bacterium that produces plastic\u0094, \u0093A minesweeper game made with bacteria\u0094 and the \u0093Piece of art made with multicolored bacteria\u0094 were all above the fifty percent mark in Basel and Lausanne, the same ideas did not seduce the students.Conversely, according to Prof. Duboule, public exposure of the current technical issues encountered by a technology such as Cas9 tends to move the debate away from the really important questions.Though \u0093ignorance of the law is no excuse\u0094, setting up courses about the current state of legislation in the fields of research that young scientists will be exploring could help them put things into perspective.The University of Lausanne for instance provides to the public an open-access lab called \u0093L\u0092\u00c9prouvette\u0094 (French for \u0093The Test Tube\u0094) [2].We were pleased to see that what we had opened their eyes on different aspects concerning the responsibilities linked to research in the field of synthetic biology.Even the most renowned scientist started by pipetting water, this is why we prepared a few activities in the lab to let the students see how it is to work in the world of synthetic biology.One of them even accused the United States of being \u0093the greatest terrorists on the planet\u0094 concerning their use of GMOs.It now appears essential to us that future scientists should be taught how to discuss their work, how to share it with other experts as well as the general public in an interactive way.When using the CRISPR technology, one of the important technical difficulties is the presence \u0093off-target effects\u0094 that can lead the protein to cut in an unwanted spot in the genome.Our examples covered a variety of different domains such as energy, agriculture, medicine and information processing (see list below).The only organism that gathered a vast majority of negative answers was the \u0093Wheat strain capable of adapting to climatic conditions\u0094.But it creates a paradox: on one side, people ask for more interaction with scientists and on the other side, they fully delegate the responsibility of research to the scientific experts.\u0093It is a very complicated question, and you are talking about the crux of the matter.The Gymnase d\u0092Yverdon, Coll\u00e8ge de Candolle and Gymnase du Bugnon keenly sent us students interested in biology and eager to find out about synthetic biology.In fact, we found out that, even though the students had advanced biology courses, the material taught does not always include synthetic biology.\u0093GMO is one of those buzzwords we hear too often without actually knowing what is meant, apart from their association with controversies and scandals\u0094 notes Aur\u00e9lie Coulon, journalist for the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps.Prof. Trono insists: \u0093We [scientists] have to constantly be discussing with the public.A third opinion, supported by Oliver Peter, assesses that the debate raised by CRISPR-Cas9 does not bring anything really new to the table compared with the Asilomar moratorium: \u0093I do not think it [a moratorium] is necessary.This is an example of how the the scientific world was unable to successfully communicate with and inform the general public.In the end, if you do not feel good about it, you must not do it, even if people disagree with you\u0094.There is nothing fundamentally new that one can do with CRISPR-Cas9 as far as I understand it\u0094.A topic that is often mentioned in discussions about moratoriums is the position and the role of ethics in the discussion.For Prof. Duboule, the problem stems from the often confusing debate in which GMOs are all tarred with the same brush \u0093We have to distinguish political, ethical and scientific problems.From our perspective, seeing the people delegate all responsibilities to researchers is the consequence of a lack of interaction.Earlier this year a group of scientists who participated in the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 called for a worldwide voluntary moratorium in order to discuss the ethical consequences of being able to easily edit and modify the human genome in an inheritable way [4].[\u0085] However, I am totally opposed to the policy of corporations that sell sterile seeds\u0094, he adds as an illustration.Our goal was also to gauge the public\u0092s reaction to the use of genetically modified organisms in various fields.Prof. Duboule suggests the following analysis: \u0093Via association mechanisms, wheat and GMOs bring people back to sensitive issues such as nutrition, the challenge of third world development, overpopulation.However we must not present ourselves as those who know everything, compared to the uneducated crowd that awaits for a magic kit that works by simply pushing a few buttons\u0094.These two seemingly contradictory positions underline a big problem in the way people in general understand synthetic biology, in Switzerland at least.This subject is further explored in our main article.In the next part of our survey, we quickly described the purpose of the iGEM competition, and presented the main idea behind our project (building independent transistors in cells).We asked the public in Lausanne about it, and the main answer was neither \u0093the people\u0094 nor \u0093politicians\u0094, but by a great margin: \u0093scientists\u0094.While our survey stimulated the interest and the curiosity of the subjects as they were reading and answering the questions (many even asked about the veracity of past iGEM projects), this open-mindedness faded out when the word GMO came up.Jean-Christophe M\u00e9roz, member of the legislation division at Swissmedic, emphasized that a moratorium on clinical applications of a technology is not to be confused with a moratorium on the technology itself.He adds that \"secularism is a chance; it gives everyone the opportunity to express their opinion, including religions\".At the end of survey we included a question from the ETHZ iGEM team.However, the general public also has the role to be well informed, and not indoctrinated.From our point of view, the scientist should not be the only one able to foresee the consequences of his/her research.An example is the editorial Steven Pinker wrote for the Boston Globe: \u0093The moral imperative for bioethics\u0094 published on August 1st 2015 [5].\u0093Managing transparency is a work the scientist could do and would be a lot more productive than not saying things, or exposing extreme points of view in order to tame the public\u0092s concerns\u0094 claims Prof. Gaia Barazzetti, ethicist specialized in bioethics.M\u00e9roz also made clear the regulatory assessment of the risks of a potential clinical treatment and ethical debates are two totally different things that should not be mixed up nor lead by the same institutions.The first answers we collected showed us that the term synthetic biology is mostly unheard of, though it mostly conveys a positive impression (see below).We then asked the subject whether this definition gave him/her a rather positive or negative feeling about synthetic biology.We would like to begin by thanking all of the experts who took the time to meet us and enlighten us with their perspectives on the difficult thematic of bioethics and synthetic biology with regard to communication and responsibility.Because the target audience was different in each of the three surveys, we decided not to combine the data, but rather to compare it for questions where opinions varied the most.We then asked passerbys whom they believed should take responsibility for the outcomes of scientific research, and control the use of derived technology.Recently, in the shadows of the very mediatized debate around CRISPR-Cas9 and the use of genetic engineering in medicine, ethics and bioethicists in particular have been described as a barrier to progress.We also asked the young students that came to our highschool day to fill out the survey.Although Switzerland is a neutral country, it spends a considerable amount of its GDP (0.8% in 2012) for military expenses [1] and is one of the only countries in Europe to maintain a compulsory military service.Indeed, production, acquisition and handing-over of any genetically modified animal would have been prohibited [1].Given the importance and relevance of this topic, we decided to investigate the issue of communication and interaction in the field of science.The imprecision of the technology could have dramatic consequences if used in a medical environment.And we already decided in our society that we do not want to interfere with the human germ line.After a while, the foam solidifies and bacteria and yeasts die by apoptosis: the isolating material is finished.The RIDG pill (R\u00e9gulateur intelligent Des Graisses or Intelligent Fat Regulator, IFR pill) is made out of bacteria that detect, once in the intestine, if the person suffers from obesity or anorexia thanks to hormone receptors.Although they are not all quoted in the following article, talking with each and every one of them was crucial in helping us explore the practical and ethical issues we were confronted with.Students used the concept of magnetic bacteria developed by the 2014 iGEM Berlin team to efficiently remove bacterias from clothes once the wash was finished.Killpilus is a permanent hair removal cream.\u0093This is my personal opinion\u0094, he precises, \u0093I\u0092d say yes to a moratorium on any research applied to humans (like the one Prof. Jennifer Doudna called for).The survey and its results can be found on the Human Pratcices page of our website.We discussed these main findings (along with the other results) with various specialists in our main article : Interaction and Communication in Scientific Research[1] Stockholm international peace research institute, http://portal.sipri.org/publications/pages/expenditures/country-search (18.09.2015)Trust is important!\u0094 claims Oliver Peter, head of the high-throughput screening group at Actelion Pharmaceuticals.However, transparency also has downsides as it may nurture a form of scaremongering: communication must be managed with care.We designed a questionnaire and submitted it to passerbys in the streets of Lausanne and Basel (in collaboration with the ETHZ iGEM team).Here is a summary of the survey and an analysis of the most interesting results.\u0093For me, those [off target effects] are secondary problems that will be solved in the coming decades.Do his competences give him authority to stand above the general public?An possible explanation to this discrepancy is the students  background in biology and chemistry students.It quickly became obvious that the matters of communication and interaction raise extremely difficult questions, and we do not claim we have a final answer.In parallel, they offer introductions to scientific research with both practical experiments and discussions about the issues around Science.At the end of the debate, we took some time to discuss the activity without the roles.During the brainstorming, each group was coached by one of our team members.Also, some form of self-questioning should always be entertained by the scientist as he/she is working, as captivating as his/her work can be.Surprisingly, the sole statement that collected a majority of negative reactions was related to agriculture, i.e the engineering of a wheat strain capable of adapting to climatic conditions.Prof. Benaroyo makes it clear: \u0093Ethics in itself will usually not give an answer as a matter of principle, ethics is reflexive, meaning that it will ask the questions and explore the issues\u0094.\u0091We are dealing with these issues together under the banner of ethics, which is healthier than giving this responsibility to the religious world\".In alphabetical order: Scientific mediator at l Eprouvette, the public laboratory of the University of LausanneScientist, researcher in agronomical microbiology at Hepia HES-SO, member of the Parliament of the State of GenevaLegislation division at Swissmedic, Swiss federal agency for therapeutic productsScientist, head of the high-throughput screening group at Actelion PharmaceuticalsThe stakes are high when it comes to science communication.However, we can hypothesize that an overly alarmist media coverage of these \u0093off target effects\u0094 could lead the general opinion to be definitely opposed to any further research concerning CRISPR-Cas9, especially future therapeutic applications.These bacteria have sensor in order to die if not in contact with the target plant or if they came in contact with animal s saliva.Note that the definition does not mention the word GMO.Results are plotted in absolute numbers of answers.On a sunny August morning, we held a stand in the Rue Haldimand of our beautiful town of Lausanne.This technical breakthrough has had the side effect of shining the spotlight on the very fundamental issue of what is acceptable or not when it comes to manipulating our genes at will as well as the risks involved in trying to do it.The ideas that they shared with us were surprisingly smart and imaginative for students who had received little technical and background information on the matter.Of all the topics covered with the experts, moratorium is the one that caused the most contrasted reactions.Opinions are more nuanced among highchool students, with half of them being favorable to the modified wheat strain.In case of obesity, the bacteria would respond to that input by secreting proteins that block lipid transporters in epithelial cells.We encountered three different points of view on the subject.We collected about twenty forms in Basel and fifty from the students.The results from Basel and Lausanne underline the unpopularity of the acronym GMO.In case of anorexia, the bacteria would secrete hormones that would make epithelial cells create more lipid transporters.Bacteria substituting pesticides.Xavier Gavend, theologist and chaplain at EPFL gave us another view on this subject by invoking the great importance of humility (which Prof. Benaroyo also mentioned as being a necessary quality for a scientist): \u0093From a Christian perspective, it is with humility that greatness can be achieved.Bacteria contained in the preparation kill hair follicle stem cells.We purposefully introduced polemical uses of GMOs, such as the modification of human embryonic cells in order to cure genetic diseases.We tried to contact the Swiss military but they declined to answer.We also asked the school chaplains to comment on the lack of religious concerns despite Switzerland s deeply religious history.In the light of this failure, how should the scientific community efficiently communicate with the outside world?Passerby came and went as they walked to and from the nearby market.The first one was about iGEM, the modalities and principles of the competition, the number of participating teams, the contribution of each team, etc.The fluid consists of bacteria that produce foam once in contact with oxygen and of yeasts that make CO2 holes in the foam.Indeed, the production, acquisition and handing-over of any genetically modified animal would have been prohibited.After the washing is finished, bacteria move towards a luminous bin where they die by apoptosis.\"easyFer\" (\"easyIron\") is a system that uses an iron detecting biosensor to simplify the iron detection in the blood.Indeed, several people spontaneously mentioned the scandals associated with the agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto.These bacteria live on the leaves of the plants and secrete repelling substances.", "modeling": "These considerations allow us to compute the response of an activated/inhibited transistor, for which we will have (using the fact that (p_b = 1 -p_a - p_i + p_{ai} ), denoting ([A]=[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a]) and ([I] =[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i] ) and setting the inhibited expression level (alpha_i) to zero) alpha_\text{max}p_a + alpha_\text{b}p_b + alpha_{ai}p_{ai} =alpha_b + (alpha_\text{max}-alpha_b) frac{H([A])}{1+K_a[I]} - alpha_b frac{H([I])}{1+K_a[A]}+(alpha_{ai}-alpha{b})H([A])H([I]) Again, we can visualize the response of the system to different levels of concentrations of the activating (A) and inhibiting (I) complexes: the response is in this case the production of new gRNAs or mRNA for reporter proteins (output signals).If we consider a completely exclusive binding (i.e.Thus, similarly for what we had for the (\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}) production we can write frac{d}{dt}[\text{gRNA}_B] = alpha_\text{gRNA}frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A]} -(gamma_{mRNA}+gamma)[mathit{gRNA}_B]+ D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B] - R_{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_B] without forgetting that gRNAs, in contrast to mRNAs, can bind dCas9 to form the dCas9-gRNA complex.In order to assess the functionality of our transistor and the targeting of the dCas9/gRNA complex, we used a measurable output: green fluorescent protein (GFP): frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] = alpha_{GFP,max}frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}]} + alpha_\text{GFP,b} left( 1 - frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}]} \right) - (gamma_{mRNA}+gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}], frac{d}{dt}[\text{GFP}] = \beta_\text{GFP} [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] - (gamma_{GFP}+gamma)[\text{GFP}].The output of a transistor needs not necessarily to be the mRNA encoding for a (fluorescent) protein.First of all we have now two distinct gRNAs in our system ((\text{gRNA}_A) and (\text{gRNA}_B)); this obviously imply the presence of two possible dCas9-gRNA complexes: frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] = R_\text{dCas9} [\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_A] - D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] - gamma[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B] = R_\text{dCas9} [\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_B] - D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B] - gamma[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B] For the production of the first gRNA, i.e.The partition function of such system, following what we did in the previous section (the same lattice model and microstate counting can be applied and we took the energy of the system with a free promoter as reference), is given by Z = 1 + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a] + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i] + K_a^2[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a][\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i]e^{-\beta J} where we assumed that the association constant is the same of the activating and inhibiting dCas9-gRNA complexes (i.e.Therefore frac{d}{dt}[\text{gRNA}] = alpha_\text{gRNA} -(gamma_{mRNA}+gamma)[mathit{gRNA}] + D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] - R_{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}] dCas9-gRNA complexes are our gene regulatory units: depending on the targeted site of a promoter, these complex can enhance or inhibit gene transcription.From this derivation it is clear that the Hill s function (H(c)) can be interpreted as the binding probability of ligands with a concentration (c).Hill s function gives a ligand/receptor binding probability and will be used to model the mRNA or gRNA transcription caused by the dCas9-gRNA in the case of simple activation or inhibition.e^{-\beta [(L-1)epsilon_\text{sol} + epsilon_\text{b}]}}{Z} This result can be simplified by the assumption that (LllOmega), which implies [1] p_\text{bound} = dfrac{frac{L}{Omega}e^{-\betaDelta epsilon}}{1 + frac{L}{Omega}e^{-\betaDelta epsilon}},We were able to find the binding probability of one ligand to a receptor using the tools of statistical physics, but this seems unrelated to the well-known Hill s function.(\text{gRNA}_A), is unchanged compared to the activation and inhibition models: frac{d}{dt}[\text{gRNA}_A] = alpha_\text{gRNA} -(gamma_{mRNA}+gamma)[mathit{gRNA}_A] + D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] - R_{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_A] For the second gRNA, i.e.p_a = frac{K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a]}{Z_{infty}} = frac{K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a]}{1 + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a] + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i]} p_i = frac{K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a]}{Z_{infty}} = frac{K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a]}{1 + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a] + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i]} This gives us the response of activation and inhibition when the binding is exclusive ((p_{ai} = 0) and again (alpha_i=0)): alpha_{max}p_a + alpha_bp_b = alpha_maxp_a + alpha_b(1-p_a-p_i) = (alpha_max-alpha_b)p_a + alpha_b (1-p_i).In the case where the interaction between the two dCas9-gRNA complexes is not negligible (because the activating/inhibiting binding sites are too close or because the persistence length of the double stranded DNA changes significantly when it is open by dCas9) we have (J\neq 0).frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] = alpha_{GFP,max}frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_\text{B}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}_\text{B}]} + alpha_\text{GFP,b} left( 1 - frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_\text{B}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}_\text{B}]}\right) - (gamma_{mRNA}+gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}], frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] = alpha_\text{dCas9} - (gamma_\text{mRNA}+gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9}] = \beta_\text{dCas9}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] - gamma [\text{dCas9}] + D_\text{dCas9}([\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A]+[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B]) - R_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}]([\text{gRNA}_A]+[\text{gRNA}_B]) frac{d}{dt}[\text{gRNA}_A] = alpha_\text{gRNA} -(gamma_{mRNA}+gamma)[mathit{gRNA}_A] + D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] - R_{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_A] frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] = R_\text{dCas9} [\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_A] - D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] - gamma[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] frac{d}{dt}[\text{gRNA}_B] = alpha_\text{gRNA}frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A]} -(gamma_{mRNA}+gamma)[mathit{gRNA}_B]+ D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B] - R_{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_B] frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B] = R_\text{dCas9} [\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_B] - D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B] - gamma[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B] frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] = alpha_{GFP,max}frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_\text{B}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}_\text{B}]} + alpha_\text{GFP,b} left( 1 - frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_\text{B}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}_\text{B}]}\right) - (gamma_{mRNA}+gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}], frac{d}{dt}[\text{GFP}] = \beta_\text{GFP} [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] - (gamma_{GFP}+gamma)[\text{GFP}]Activation and inhibition can be present at the same time, since dCas9 can target different promoter sites depending on the gRNA.For S. cerevisiae we will set (J=0) as we assume no interaction between two dCas9 bound to the same promoter (because the distance between binding sites is large), while in E. coli we will use either (J=0) ot (J=infty) depending on experimental observations (we don t have references showing that inhibition wins over activation for this organism).Therefore In contrast, when the inhibiting site is far from the activating one (independent binding), we observed a very small deviation from the basal level (we have a slight activation):Because of the experimental differences outlined above, we will consider both exclusive and independent binding in our model, using the extreme cases where (J=0) and (J=infty) respectively.In order to test experimentally the chainability of our biological transistors, we added an intermediate step to the production of GFP by activation: a first gRNA ((gRNA_A)) bound to dCas9 target a promoter which produces a second gRNA ((gRNA_B)) which in turn can activate the production of GFP.Compared to simple activation, our model changes in the following ways.This can be explained by the fact that half of the transistors are inactive (no GFP production since (alpha_iapprox 0)) and the other half are active at steady state.If binding is independent, we obtain levels which are comparable to the basal expression.Now that we are able to reproduce qualitatively our experimental results for the transistors, we can put together multiple transistors in order to create a logic gate.Since our kinetic model is able to reproduce the behavior of our transistor qualitatively, we may use this model to asses the functionality of a logic gate.frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] = alpha_\text{dCas9} - (gamma_\text{mRNA}+gamma)

targeting site of the dCas9-gRNA complex.In this case, we can consider the binding of two dCas9-gRNA complexes to the same promoter to be independent ((Japprox 0)).For the case of an inhibiting site close to the activating one (exclusive binding), we observed a diminution of activation of almost 25%.In addition, since the binding dynamics of two dCas9 to adjacent binding sites on the same promoter is not know, we developed a generalized version of Hill s model in order to include dCas9/dCas9 interaction; we will consider only the two extrema of this model which are zero or infinite interaction strength.Promotor strength is modeled by an Hill s function, with an Hill s coefficient close to one The following table summarize the constants used in our model (see Equations).From the partition function we can easily obtain the binding probability of activating and inhibiting complexes: p_a = frac{K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a]}{Z_0} = frac{H([\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a])}{1+K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i]} p_i = frac{K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i]}{Z_0} = frac{H([\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i])}{1+K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a]} where (H) is the standard Hill s function.As stated previously, the dCas9-gRNA complex is degraded as a whole (at the same rate as unbound dCas9 degradation), but we can still have dCas9/gRNA dissociation which will increase gRNA population.The hypothesis of independence for the activating and inhibiting site obviously leads to p_{ai} = frac{K_a^2[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a][\text{dCas9-gRNA}_b]}{Z_0} = H([\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a])H([\text{dCas9-gRNA}_b]) where (H) is always the standard hill s function.frac{d}{dt}[\text{GFP}] = \beta_\text{GFP} [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] - (gamma_{GFP}+gamma)[\text{GFP}].Chainability of different transistor-like elements is the key point of our project.In the case of activation, the dCas9-gRNA complex targets a sequence on DNA such that the RNA polymerase (RNAP) recruiting unit ((omega) in E. Coli and VP64 in yeast) is close to the RNAP binding site: the recruiting unit enhance RNAP binding and therefore gene transcription.This probability is plotted as a contour plot in the following figure for clarity.Probability (p_{ai}) in function of the concentration of activating and inhibiting complexes for the non-interacting model ((J=0)) in the case where (K_d=10\text{nM}).Our experimental results shows that in E. coli the inhibition is not as dominant as in S. cerevisiae as the distance between inhibiting and activating promoter binding sites is smaller and dCas9/dCas9 interaction play an important role.In order to model activation and inhibition in S. cerevisiae and E. coli, we will use two extrema of the binding model developed in the Binding section.The transcriptional response of our transistor targeted by activating and inhibiting complexes is given by where (alpha_\text{max}) is the maximal expression under activation, (alpha_b) is the basal expression (found in the Constants page) and (alpha_{ai}) is the expression when two dCas9-gRNA complexes are bound.In this case the last term of (Z) wanishes and the partition function of our system is simply Z_{infty} = lim_{J\toinfty} Z = 1 + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a] + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i].the complex on the activating and inhibiting sites does not interact (J=0), the partition function can be factorized: Z_0 = lim_{J\to 0}Z = (1+ K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a])(1+ K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i]).In the case of inhibition, the dCas9-gRNA target sequence on DNA is so close to the RNAP binding site that the RNAP is not able to bind anymore; this steric inhibition prevents gene transcription.If we interpret the Hill function as a binding probability [1], in the case of inhibition we have that a basal expression is possible when nothing is bound to the promotor.We can imagine two different types of degradation for the dCas9-gRNA complex : degradation of the whole complex and degradation of the gRNA s targeting sequence (resulting in a non-functional but occupied dCas9).Since the DNA coding for dCas9 fused with the VP64 subunit is 4323bp (see BioBrick BBa_K1723021), we find an production rate of 0.23-0.39 protein transcript per minute.However, the chain elongation gives only an initial lag and thus it will be neglected in our model; what is important is the rate of transcription initiation, which can be found in Ref.Now the length of double stranded DNA is of 3.1 \u00c5 per base [22], therefore the distance between the activating and inhibiting sites in E. coli spans from 102 \u00c5 to 115 \u00c5 while in S. cerevisiae it is 208 \u00c5.As activating and inhibiting sites are 20bp long (62 \u00c5), we see that in E. coli the dCas9-gRNA targeting of one site is not necessarily independent of the state of the other site (occupied or free) while in S. cerevisiae it can be considered as such.In the next graph we can see that the response of a system composed of two bio-transistors: the first one produces a gRNA that in turn binds to free dCas9 in order to activate GFP production.We can see that the stationary state of GFP expression is similar to simple activation.We found that our model considered at the steady state is able to satisfactory describe experimental results and can be used to predict the output of complex logic circuits.In the following text we will often call dCas9 our dCas9 protein fused with the RNA polymerase recruiting unit.(\text{gRNA}_B), we have production tanks to the activating effect of the (\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A) complex.Results of the simulation are presented below, where we used the model (J=0) (independent binding) for our transistors.We see that our model reproduces the truth table of the NAND gate.Furthermore, we computed the response of a single transistor when activating and inhibiting dCas9-gRNA complexes are present at the same time to study the response of the gate when different concentrations of inputs are present.We can see that this NAND gate design works as expected for any high concentration of the two input.In addition, the superposition of GFP kinetic curves for chaining and simple activation shows a shift in time of the first case with respect to the second, as expected.As we explained extensively in the Binding section, in our system it is possible to have dCas9-gRNA complexes bound at the same time on the activating and inhibiting sites.If we have an inhibiting site too close to the activating one, the GFP production will be smaller than in the case were we have activation alone, but it is still much higher than the basal level.Therefore, if we are able to model activation, inhibition and activation/inhibition of our transistors we can use them in parallel and chain them together in order to create logic gates.Once the parameters of our system had been either found in the literature or estimated, we performed our first simulation.frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] = alpha_\text{dCas9} -

(gamma_{GFP}+gamma)[\text{GFP}]Logic gates and complex systems are designed from bio-transistor.Since high levels of dCas9 are toxic for the cell [3], a constantly varying dCas9 population is required for a signal to propagate from one gate to another (remember, the output of a gate is a gRNA which will bind to a free dCas9 in order to propagate the signal to the next gate).Now, if we suppose that the cell volume for E. coli is approximately 1\u00b5m3 and in S. cerevisiae is 60\u00b5m3 [1] we can compute the production rate of mRNAs within the whole cell.the energy of dCas9-gRNA bound to activating or inhibiting sites is the same) and where (J) is the interaction energy between the two complexes.Activation and inhibition processes are modeled using fist-order Hill functions: the Hill function is interpreted as the probability of our dCas9-gRNA complex being bound to the promoter [1].This unit is called (omega) in E. coli and VP64 in S. cerevisiae.Our activation model consists of a simple transistor that takes a dCas9-gRNA complex as an input (A) and produces a gRNA (C).Since the same system may be modeled using different approaches, we will justify our choices and set of assumptions.The most important assumption underlying our kinetic model is the fact that the concentration of a given species does not depends on spatial coordinates, i.e.The switch between basal and activated states is obtained by the binding/unbinding of the dCas9/gRNA complex and is represented by an Hill s function, which gives the probability of a dCas9/gRNA complex being attached to the promotor [1].Because of these additional reaction, dCas9 population changes as follows: frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9}] = \beta_\text{dCas9}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] - gamma [\text{dCas9}] + D_\text{dCas9}([\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A]+[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_B]) - R_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}]([\text{gRNA}_A]+[\text{gRNA}_B]).Obviously, the situation is probably more complex and (J) assumes an intermediate value on the interval ([0,infty]), but for simplicity we used only these extreme values.In our system we now have to distinguish between gRNAs which target the inhibiting sequence (which we call (gRNA_I)) and gRNAs which target the activating sequence (which we call (gRNA_A)).In E. coli the distance between the activating and inhibiting sequences is of 33bp or 37bp (remember, we have two possible inhibiting sites), while in S. cerevisiae this distance is of 67bp.In this case, the binding of dCas9-gRNA to the promotor enhances transcription, which is otherwise in a basal expression.In order to use this approach, we assume implicitly that the number of dCas9-gRNA binding sites is much smaller than the number of dCas9-gRNA present in our system.either the activator or the inhibitor complex is attached to the promoter), in our model we have to set (J\toinfty) (i.e.For this reason we can only compare our model and experimental data at steady state.Since our first simulation of the basal expression produced acceptable results, we focused on the activation of our biological transistor-like element.The number of microstates (W) for this system is given by the number of ways (W_f) of arranging the (L) ligands inside the lattice with a free receptor plus the number of ways (W_o) of arranging the (L-1) ligands inside the lattice with an occupied receptor: W = W_f + W_o = frac{Omega!}{L!(Omega-L)!}The population of unbound dCas9 is also affected by the binding between dCas9 and a gRNA.Thus the equation of (\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}) production is now the following: frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] = alpha_{GFP,b}left( 1 - frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}\right) - (gamma_{mRNA}+gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}].the concentration diminution caused by cell division.In our project, the dCas9-gRNA complex is used as a transcription factor.Since the DNA coding for dCas9 fused with the (omega) subunit is 4374bp (see BioBrick BBa_K1723000), the total number of amino acids composing the protein is 1458.In grey we have dCas9, in red the gRNA scaffold, in blue the gRNA 20bp specificity determinant sequence and in green the (omega) RNAP subunit.From the protein structure we can estimate the size of dCas9 on the DNA: the length along the direction of the DNA binding site is approximately 80 \u00c5.However, a good model (tuned on the experiment we performed for single transistors) allows the design and the study of complex circuits in silico.We attempted to model the dynamics of our system s components to predict the temporal response of our biological circuits.In this simulation we computed the basal expression of GFP from the activity of our transistor element in E. coli.However, it turns out that dCas9 degrade slowly [13] and again we decided to neglect this degradation compared to dilution.In the following text we will call, for simplicity, dCas9 our dCas9 protein fused with the RNA polymerase recruiting unit.We therefore coded a Python program that automatically generates the set of differential equations needed to model a gate or a circuit composed of multiple gates.For S. cerevisiae, we found all the necessary constants (cf.The probabilities (p_a), (p_b) and (p_{ai}) are defined in the Binding section and depends on the system under investigation (basically, on the value of (J)).dCas9-gRNA population varies accordingly to dCas9 and gRNA populations: frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] = R_\text{dCas9} [\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}] - D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] - gamma[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] Our simple transistor (used to simulate activation) can be found in two states: activated or basal.However, it is possible to extract the (omega) subunit directly from the RNA polymerase (RNAP) and align it with the dCas9 protein structure.We will focus here on dCas9-(omega), as for dCas9-VP64 the same conclusions hold.The design we picked is the simplest one and is represented below.This gate accepts four types of gRNAs, two representing the state of the input A (0 or 1) and the other two representing the state of input B (also 0 or 1).We extracted the (omega) subunit from the E. coli RNA polymerase (PDB 3LU0, [19]).This means that at low concentrations of (\text{dCas9-gRNA}) we have a basal expression, while at high concentrations the production of (\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}) is extremely low.By neglecting (alpha_i) (which does not appears anywhere on the inhibition kinetic model), we obtained the following response for our transistor.Due to the simplification we made, the inhibited level is very low at steady state.The GFP used in E. coli is 717bp, while the GFP used in S. cerevisiae is 714bp.For GFP degradation we consider the GFP(mut3) half-life time (BioNumber 105191) and we computed the degradation rate in the same way we did for mRNAs.In addition, we assumed that this degradation rate of the whole complex is the same of gRNA-free dCas9.dCas9 and GFP degradation are slow.frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] = alpha_\text{dCas9} -

frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}\right) - (gamma_{mRNA}+gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}].In order to achieve a good description we initially used the powerful tools of statistical mechanics in order to generalize Hill s description of ligand-receptor binding [1] taking into account a possible interaction between two dCas9 binding to the same promoter.In our experimental setup, deigned to asses the functionality of our transistor-like elements, the output C is used to enhance the production of GFP to enable a quantitative measurement of the activation (with respect to the basal expression).For the dCas9-gRNA/DNA interaction, we can justify this hypothesis by thinking of an average nucleotide composition, as our synthetic sequences are randomly generateddCas9 degradation is a fundamental process in our system.Here we assume for simplicity that all promotors are of the same kind, the only difference being the number of copies of the plasmid they are in (low-copy, medium-copy, and high-copy).This subunit is then aligned to the dCas9 protein (PDB 4ZT9, [20]) in order to keep the continuity on the DNA sequence.Since GFP degradation rate is slow, it will be neglected and we will consider only the dilution rate.Thus we have frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] = alpha_\text{dCas9} - (gamma_\text{mRNA}+gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9}] = \beta_\text{dCas9}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] - gamma [\text{dCas9}] + D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] - R_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}] gRNA is produced by an inducible promoter.Constants), thus obtaining the last parameter needed to model activation.Modeling enabled us to predict an activated GFP expression that is 17 times higher than the basal expression.However, since our model is deterministic, it does not take into account biologic noise: a gate design that works well in silico is not guarenteed to work experimentally.We here focus on the NAND gate, which has the following truth table (A and B are the inputs, C is the output).Various gate designs may reproduce this truth table.We assume that only two different gRNAs (one for A, one for B) are present at one time; this assumption can be achieved experimentally by producing only the needed gRNAs.We have that GFP and dCas9 are encoded in a low-copy plasmid, while mRNAs are encoded in a medium-copy plasmid.For E. Coli, we found a polypeptide chain elongation rate of 12-21 amino acids per second (BioNumber 100059, [8]).From the simulation, we see that the ratio between proteins and gRNAs (included GFP, when espressed) is very large, i.e.We suppose that the energy of one ligand in the solution is (epsilon_\text{sol}) while the energy of a ligand bound to the receptor is (epsilon_\text{b}).},Each microstate has a weight, which is given by the Boltzmann factor (if you are not at ease with the concepts of statistical mechanics, we encourage you to consult Ref.In the complex case where activation and inhibition compete we have to take into account a possible interaction between the two dCas9-gRNA complex: the presence of one complex on the activating/inhibiting sites can partially prevent the attachment of another complex.This statistical view of regulatory dynamic is then used, following the same steps of the simple ligand-receptor binding, to write kinetic equations.Kinetic equations forms a system of ODEs which is solved numerically and fitted to some experimental data, in order to describe the actual dynamic of the system.For exclusive binding we obtain a GFP level which is half of the level obtained for simple activation.This is certainly caused by the fact that our inhibited level is zero ((alpha_{i}=0)).The output of the gate modeled here are fluorescent proteins: we have RFP for the state 1 of output C, while GFP represents the state 0.Statistical mechanics rely on the concept of microstate which is one particular realization of the microscopic arrangement of the constituents for the problem of interest [1].In order to simplify we will consider a lattice model for particles in solution, i.e.Results) we found the following ratio between basal and inhibited states (after subtracting the autofluosescence): However, in our model of dCas9-gRNA binding, we used (alpha_iapprox 0).Results), we found the following ratio between basal and activated states (after subtracting the autofluosescence) of: This ratio is very similar to the one obtained by Bikard et al.Note that for an exponential decay, the half-life (t_{1/2}) is linked to the lifetime (\tau) byThe estimation of mRNA/gRNA production rates is more complicated as it depends on promotor characteristics.This gives finally a production rate of 0.49-0.86 protein transcript per minute.In S. cerevisiae, the polypeptide chain elongation rate is estimated to be 5.5-9.3 amino acids per second [9].In this case, it is not clear a priori if this binding is completely independent or if there is an interaction between the dCas9s.The dCas9-gRNA complex enhances the production of the output C, which is otherwise produced basally.[9] Bonven and Gull\u00f8v, Peptide chain elongation rate and ribosomal activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a function of the growth rate, Molecular and General Genetics, vol.It is often impossible to describe the system by describing each particle individually but this is not a major problem if we are interested in the average behavior of the system; the mathematical tool which allows such description is statistical mechanics.The results of this simulation are presented below.Since our parameters were estimated or taken from different papers published over many years, the results of our model had to be analyzed with care.In addition, we ca see that for GFP, there is some leakage when the output is A0-B1 or A1-B0.Results) showed that the GFP production depends on the distance between the activating and inhibiting site.We now own a computational tool which may assess the functionality of different gate designs (i.e different collections of transistors).Writing the equations of logic gates starting from the basic equations of the transistor (cf.This assumption is quite bold but is a common approach in the literature and usually produces accurate results [1].At the beginning of the experiments, cells are growing at a a faster rate than the rate of GFP production, therefore the OD600 normalization causes a drop of RFU (relative fluorescence units) levels.In contrast, our model is at a the single cell level and does not represent this phenomenon.This means that the subunit is placed at the right place with respect do dCas9, but its orientation may be wrong.dCas9-(omega) structure with gRNA.In this section we will keep track of the assumptions we made in order to clarify our model.[17] H.M. Berman et al., The Protein Data Bank, Nucleic Acids Research, vol.Experimentally we won t expect such sharp transition.In conclusion, our model is able to quantitatively reproduce the behavior of the NAND gate.it is the same in every region of the cell.Finally, we see that the transition between output 0 and output 1 is very rapid at the boundaries.[1] R. Phillips et al., Physical Biology of the Cell, Second Edition, Garland Science, 2013.GFP is now present at high concentration, but this concentration is still compatible with the total protein concentration within a cell.Experimentally (cf.The following question needed to be answered : Are predicted GFP concentration in the nM range and do they make sense?Constants) but we didn t obtain the experimental results that are required to perform the initial fine-tuning of the model.[1] for a very clear and biology-friendly introduction to the subject).This means that the production rate is of 10 mRNA per minute.This gives finally frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] = alpha_\text{max}p_a + alpha_bp_b + alpha_{ai}p_{ai} - (gamma_{mRNA}+gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}].Dilution is estimated from the half-life of our organism.For the gRNA/dCas9 interaction, this assumption is justified by the fact that the gRNA scaffold is always the same.In some cases it may also be necessary to consider the stochastic behavior of individual trajectories rather than global averages [1].One of the challenges we faced while building the model was the lack of readily available kinetic constants.One may imagine that the binding/unbinding constants are somewhat related to the gRNA sequence given the different chemical properties of nucleotide sequences.All manipulations are performed with the VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics, [18]) software and final images are rendered with Pixar s RenderMan rendering engine.We can observe that the predicted time-response (outside of equilibrium) is somehow different from what we observed experimentally (cf.This is mainly caused by the difference in initial conditions.[15] R.

replicates was chosen All our reporter + wrong gRNA constructs showed similar fluorescence levels and no activation or inhibition pattern.Interestingly, we notice that for A/R1 the activation and the inhibition sites are on the same strand, whereas in A/R2 the sites are a bit farther and on different strands.Transistor Mutability: The promoter\u0092s regulatory sites may be mutated while conserving its transistor behaviourWe selected dCas9-w targets outside of the -10 and -35 regions on BBa_ and mutated them.Overall, R1, R2 and R1/R2 produce fluorescence close to basal levels and the transistor is considered to be in \u0093off\u0094 state.Yet, when activation and inhibition sites are targeted simultaneously, dCas9-w bound to inhibition position hinders induction (A/R1, A/R2).For each biological replicate, the median of three technical replicates was chosenInducing the upstream transistor successfully resulted in induction of downstream transistor (A_u) to levels comparable to direct activation of BBa_1723005 (A_alt).For each biological replicate, the median of three technical replicates was chosenIn this experiment, we used arabinose(ara)-inducible promoters to produce gRNA inputs.For each biological replicate, the median of three technical replicates was chosenThe basal levels of the original promoter and the alternative one are very similar.The response of the mutated promoter for single gRNA input, however, suggests that it behaves similarly to the original promoter.Relative strength between activation of BBa_1723001 and is mutated cousin BBa_1723005 using specific gRNA displayed moderate variability but activation and inhibition patterns were preservedOrthogonality : Transistors do not produce activation or inhibition patterns when the input gRNA is not complementary to their regulation sitesMeasurement 16.A/R2 produces an output consistent with predictions for a model where activation and inhibition sites may be bound by dCas9-w without steric hindrance between the dCas9-ws: binding is independent.Contrary to the experiments presented above - which were performed at a fixed concentration of aTc - we investigated the impact of [aTc] on transistor response.Surprisingly we observe that activation decreases when [aTc] is too high.The location it binds to may therefore be controlled by producing specific gRNAs.By targeting dCas9 fused to a RNAP recruiting subunit (dCas9-?) to an adequate distance from the transcription starting site (TSS), PAM-rich_J23117 (BBa_K1723001) was successfully induced, which represents a PNP transistor in \u0093on\u0094 state.The bio-transistor was designed to produce GFPmut2.We will test different features, such as the activation, the repression, both activation and repression simultaneously and orthogonality.As a little reminder, we use 2 repressing gRNAs, c6 & c7, whenever we repress the promoter.As dCas9-VP64 is under control of a Galactose + aTc promoter, we tested different aTc concentrations to obtain a better response.This result is consistent with studies of dCas9\u0092s specificity in the literature [3].Unfortunately, we lacked time to test specific regulation of one transistor among several within the same cell.For each biological replicate, the median of three technical replicates was chosenBacterial cultures were monitored in a plate reader for 17 hours.On the other hand, in the inhibition condition the levels are already close to basal and [ara] has little effect on the transistor s output.We notice that activation (A) is impacted by the input levels.For each biological replicate, the median of three technical replicates was chosen.The transistor response experiment is also informative on the orthogonality of signals as two gRNA inputs seem to have worked in parallel to produce the A/R1 response (see above).A/R1 on the other hand behaves as if co-binding of the activation and inhibition sites were impossible.When targeting the CYC0 promoter with a different gRNA (the inhibitory gRNA for promoter CYC1 in this case), the fluorescence is not influenced.Thereby, we created an alternative transistor (BBa_K1723005) and set of gRNA inputs.Measurement 17 (left) and 3 (right).Error bars represent one standard deviation for n = 3 biological replicates.We found out that A/R2 may virtually suppress activation; the promoter is in \u0093off\u0094 state.Activation is repressed when both activation and inhibition sites are bound by dCas9-?Measurement 13 in the lab notebook.It means that the building of orthogonal circuits that don\u0092t interfere with each other is possible and feasible!Unfortunately, due to lack of time, some tests as the chainability, the mutability or the measure of a logic gate response were not feasible.Promoter activity for each input combination was assessed by measuring Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU) and normalised by OD600 which should beWe chose to test two sites close enough to the TSS to (likely) sterically hinder RNA Polymerase (RNAP) attachement when bound by dCas9-?.Nevertheless, clues that multiple transistors can work simultaneously can be found in the chaining experiment below, where two non-orthogonal promoters worked in conjunction.We discovered that the response of the system seems completely independent of the concentration of aTc!The activation is clearly above the basal level (at the end of the measure, when the equilibrium tend to be reached, the ratio between activation and basal level is approximately 1:4).By itself, targeting dCas9-? to inhibition sites (R1, R2), sometimes resulted in slight activation (experiment 3) and sometimes in slight inhibition (experiment 1).We conjecture that E. coli replicate faster than the time needed for the transistor + reporter system to follow: if OD600 grows faster than the RFUs, the normalised fluorescence result will decrease.Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv137.As the transistor is the simplest unit in complex circuits, we want to characterize it for further applications.This might be explained by the already low promoter strength of J23117 (close to autofluorescence in our measurements and consistent with the registry BBa_J23117) and the presence of the activating ? subunit on dCas9-?.This will obviously cause steric inhibition and prevent the RNA Polymerase to bind the promoter (just go check our modeling page for the dCas9 shape and minimal binding distance).The orthogonality showed good results as well!This measurement provides clues as to how the transistor responds with increasing signal strength.Furthermore, the activating gRNA induce a higher GFP expression as the inhibitory one (ratio 1:2 approximately).We notice that the basal expression of the downstream reporter BBa_1723005 in chained configuration (B_d) is higher than the basal expression of BBa_1723005 alone (B_alt).Error bars represent one standard deviation for n = 3 biological replicates.Error bars represent one standard deviation for n = 3 biological replicates.Error bars represent one standard deviation for n = 3 biological replicates.Error bars represent one standard deviation for n = 3 biological replicates.Error bars represent one standard deviation for n = 3 biological replicates.This is probably due to leakage from the upstream promoter, as repressing the upstream promoter (R_u) resulted in lower RFU/OD600.In most measurements, the transistor stabilises faster (~ 300 min).Measurement 9.In order to build dCas9-controlled circuits, we aim to use dCas9-inducible synthetic promoters to mimic the behaviour of a transistor (Go take a look at our design (LINK) if you haven t !).To see whether such promoters could be used in wider-scale circuits, we identified and tested the following desirable properties :Transistor response : Is the transistor inducible?Moreover, the model predicted that despite sharing the intracellular apo-dCas9 pool, the gRNA inputs are still able to form a sufficient amount of gRNA-dCas9 complexes to work as expectedMeasurement 16.This might be the first exclusively dCas9-based bio-circuit in E. coli !Measurement 6.", "safety": "All our waste and biowaste were treated accordingly to the legislation in our country.Our project is based on the dCas9, a derived form of the very polemical CRISPR-Cas9 protein which raised safety issues concerning the \u0093off target effects\u0094 (when the Cas9 is guided to and cuts an unwanted sequence in the genome).These effects led us to think about some ways to minimize the risks of unwanted targeting, both in the genome of E.coli and S. cerevisiae we are working with.In our case (with dCas9), the risk is the following: if a guide RNA causes dCas9 to bind a regulatory region of gene in an unwanted fashion, it might be deadly for the organism.To assess these issues we designed a program that automatically blasts the guide RNA (gRNA) plus de PAM sequence (either CCn at the beginning or nGG at the end) against the genome of E. coli, S. cerevisiae and the human genome.When we had the result the program would give us the sequences that are not in the organisms.Future iGEM teams could use our software to read their BLAST results and to draw conclusions of the results that could maybe result in less \u0093off-target effects\u0094.Even though we won\u0092t introduce Cas9 or dCas9 into a human cell we wanted to check if there was a risk of gene activation/inhibition if we got a large quantity of these proteins into our body.", "keywords": "constructed communication Xochimilco

medal at the 2016 Jamboree.", "design": "", "human_practice": "These price hikes are making it very difficult for patients to get the treatment they need to prevent their condition from regressing.Impact on design: One of the intrinsic benefits of developing a probiotic therapeutic is that our therapeutic has the capacity to provide a significantly cheaper treatment as bacterial cell cultures are relatively inexpensive to maintain.The impact that price had on the development of our genetic circuit is related to the patient\u0092s desire for a longer term treatment, which is discussed below under \u0093High Dosage Frequency\u0094.Concern: One of the significant issues that patients expressed with the current treatment regime was the requirement for medicine to be refrigerated, whilst also being taken four times daily.See how dry and wet lab research informed our chelator choices here.Valerie Wheater, patient and Treasurer of the Wilson\u0092s Disease Support Group (WDSG)We then contacted the Wilson\u0092s Disease Support Group (WDSG), hoping to get the opinion of current patients on our idea and ask them about their concerns with current treatments.This contributed to our choice of E. coli K-12 Nissle 1917 as our final chassis - as this strain produces colicins, allowing it to successfully compete with other E. coli strains, including pathogenic strains(3).Having designed genetic circuitry and decided to produce a probiotic therapeutic, we returned to the public to determine whether they would be willing to take a treatment of this sort.We found that the majority of individuals would be happy to take a probiotic treatment, if prescribed and recommended by their doctor.Obviously, this requirement is limiting, and patients were keen for the development of a longer term treatment.Impact on design: Initially, our idea was to produce bacteria that would constitutively express copper chelators.These discussions have influenced our project through the design of our genetic circuitry and method of delivery.As we met with patients, they also raised concerns over the lack of awareness of Wilson\u0092s Disease and other rare diseases in the general public.We examined these limitations and returned to the drawing board, altering the design of our project to address these disadvantages.Concern: Trientine Dihydrochloride and Penicillamine are currently used to treat Wilson\u0092s Disease.He informed us of some of the issues he perceived with current treatments, which have not been improved upon since the 1980s due to lack of research into other options.Following this meeting, we began our research into specific copper-binding proteins that our bacteria could constitutively express to chelate excess copper.However, this would require constant applications of the treatment.Upon deciding to produce a long term probiotic treatment, we spoke to Professor of Evolutionary Biology, Kevin Foster, about how we could ensure that our bacteria persist in the gut.We carried out a survey in conjunction with the iGEM team from Vilnius, Lithuania, to compare results from our two countries.From the results of our survey, we decided to use a \u0093jelly-like\u0094 bead to deliver our bacteria to the intestine.Side effects associated with Trientine Dihydrochloride include nausea, skin rash, severe stomach pains, diarrhoea, and anaemia(2).Impact on design: Following the discussion of side effects, we investigated the risks associated with probiotic bacteria, further information can be found here.Despite this, due to it being the subject of more in-depth research, penicillamine is usually the first treatment prescribed, followed by trientine if adverse effects are observed.Serious adverse effects such as bone marrow suppression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea are observed in 20-30% of cases(1).She also expressed the general desire among patients for a longer term treatment.Following our introduction to Valerie, we attended the 6th AGM of the WDSG and presented our project idea before talking to patients to get their feedback.The chelators DO work, but with severe side effects, and there has been little interest in research looking new treatment methods since.\u0094The initial idea for our project came from a lecture by Dr Garry Brown on inborn errors of metabolism.Another portion of those surveyed were unsure, hopefully by providing further information, these individuals may be able to be persuaded to embrace a probiotic treatment.Once we had determined our genetic circuitry, we reached out to patients and members of the general public to determine how best to deliver our probiotic.Since its inception, one group have informed the design more than any other: the doctors and patients themselves.He advised us to consider the distribution of different bacteria in the small intestine when deciding on our chassis.As seen on our Human Practices Silver Medal page, public perception and feedback have played a large part in the direction of our project and its design.Trientine Dihydrochloride production in the UK is under the monopoly of a single company, and over the last two years there has been a 600% increase in the cost of the drug, despite the relatively inexpensive production costs.In the USA, the situation is even worse, with both Penicillamine and Trientine Dihydrochloride having a price of over $22,000 per 100 capsules.This concern primarily influenced the choice of chassis that we would ultimately want to use for our therapeutic.From our safety research this and discussion with Professor Kevin Foster (see below), we decided that ideally we would use E. coli K-12 Nissle 1917 to express our chelation system.The yearly treatment costs for a patient are approximately \u00a350,000, meaning that the NHS are spending millions of pounds per year on treatments.We first spoke to Valerie Wheater, the group\u0092s treasurer.They expressed 3 key limitations with current treatments: side effects, price, and the high dosage frequency.We integrated this into our public engagement activities.\u0093The therapies used today are the same as those in the 1980s \u0096 zinc and copper chelators.", "modeling": "We can determine how many moles of copper this is:If one litre of intestinal fluid contains ~10e11 bacteria, this means that, on average, every twenty minutes, the concentration of copper will drop by:And hence the rate of change in concentration throughout the gut is:In order to use this figure to make predictions about the efficiency of our treatment, we next developed a partial differential model (PDE) of the gut.This involved treating the gut as an axisymmetric cylindrical pipe along which intestinal fluid flows at a constant average speed (this ignores the effects of peristalsis).We arrived at the following PDE which describes how the concentration of copper would evolve with time and with distance along a streamline through the gut.The time derivative describes how the concentration at each point in the gut varies with time.In order to develop the system of equations required to model each system, we had to work out each reaction which was occurring and determine its reaction rate constantsThe following reactions involving mRNA occurred in all our systems:The following reactions were involved in the pCopA system:The following reactions were involved in the pCusC system:Finally, these are reactions in which Csp1 is involved:This table give the various parameter values we found in literature:Here are the systems of equations we used to model each systemWe first modelled how copper within the bacterial cell will be chelated, assuming that there wouldn\u0092t be any further intake.Modelling was used in order to simulate and later to characterise the behaviour of these promoters to demonstrate which of the promoters are suitable for the use of the project.For each of the promoters, we developed a kinetic model to simulate / analyse its behaviour.For more information about the parts and sequences, please visit our Parts page.To predict copper chelation efficiency of our bacteria, we developed kinetic models to simulate reactions in the bacterial cell for each of our four promoters.In order to simulate the transition of different quantities, eventually reaching equilibrium, we used ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved by MATLAB.Our team developed a mathematical framework to simulate the effectiveness of designs and analyse the performance of our bacteria.We developed our models for the following four main purposes:1.Simulating reactions in the bacterial cell to predict its copper chelation efficiency.2.Characterisation of promoters by parameter fittings to the standard Hill function.4.Simulating the spread and settlement of bacteria in the gutIn the first two models, we applied mathematical methods of modelling chemical reaction, transcription of repressed promoters and chelation, using MATLAB to solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and fitting parameters to the standard Hill function.The final term represents the combined effects of degradation and dilution of the protein concentration.For a given copper concentration (Cui) this simplifies to:Hence we can determine a set of K1 and K2 for each copper concentration by using a least squares optimisation to fit this curve to the data.For Csp1 the fractional occupation is given by the following equation (see the table below for parameter values):From this, we can estimate the amount of copper that is bound to the chelator for different copper concentration.To determine the other parameters we can use another least squares optimisation to fit the following equation to the values of K1:Below is a table of our fitted parameters for each promoter:* PG, PMG: pCopA sfGFP with constitutively expressed CueRThe full graph from the plate reader experiment can be found here.Although the parameter fitting should have yielded a general insight into the order of magnitude of the constants for K and n (alpha, beta and gamma are in arbitrary units), it turned out less helpful than it was hoped to be as, the fluorescence per cell data over time from the plate reader experiment decreased rather than increased, as can be seen from the graphs in PDF.Initial external copper concentration (simulated in the gut) was assumed to be around 10uM \u0096 we didn t assume any further intake of copper.We found that the maximum transcription rate of mRNA is the limiting factor to the production of chelators, and although the chelators are effective in themselves, as chelators are not reusable in our system, reduction of copper is still proportional to the number of chelators produced.(2001) CueR (YbbI) of Escherichia coli is a MerR family regulator controlling expression of the copper exporter CopA, Molecular Microbiology 39(2), pp.(12)The equation for diffusive mass transfer can be derived from Newton\u0092s law of cooling and is:(1)Where Ab = total surface area of beads, Km = mass transfer coefficient, Cb = concentration of bacteria in bead, Cg = concentration of bacteria in gutBy conservation of mass we can equate the mass increase within the gut to the mass decrease within the beads:(2)Where Vg and Vb denote the volume of the intestine and the beads respectively and the dot notation on the concentration terms denotes  rate of change .Anticlockwise, starting in at the top left: copper concentration profile as it moves along the gut; heat map showing copper distribution as it moves along the gut; bar chart showing the proportion of copper absorbed by the body and our bacteria; variation in gut copper content with time.Beads are the mechanism that we will be using to supply the bacteria to the patient.The following is the simulated results for each of the four promoters.Then, we simulated how external copper concentration will change with copper chelation within E Coli.On the right hand side, the first term describes the change in copper concentration due to flow down the gut.The time taken for the drug to be released once inside the patient is determined by how long it takes for this coating to be degraded.This can be modelled as a diffusion process, the release of the bacteria into the gut occurs at an increasing rate with respect to time.Although these models where useful for qualitatively describing the variations in species concentration, they were unable to provide accurate predictions for expression levels since many of the model parameters were unknown (or so imprecise, they were of little use).Hence the next stage of our modelling attempted to take the data from plate reader experiments and fit our promoter models to it.Fitting each individual parameter would have been extremely difficult, since our experiments only provided data on the system as a whole rather than individual reactions like transcription and translation.Hence:The solution to the equation (found by Laplace transforms) is:The total number of moles of copper in the gut at any time is given by:The second part is true as we are assuming the gut is axisymmetric.Kbody is the rate of absorption of copper by the gut naturally such that 40% of the copper ingested is absorbed.The stomach empties into the gut exponentially with a half-time of 15 minutes.Since K2=delta regardless of the copper concentration, the values of K2 should be relatively consistent.The feedback system wasn\u0092t as effective as we have expected, mainly because the feedback system comes into effect only when copper concentration is low.K, the half saturating constant, gives the copper concentration at which the promoter allows expression at half the maximum rate.Vg is approximately 3e-3 [13]We need to use the two relationships above to find a relationship between concentration of bacteria in the intestine, Cg and time, t.(3)Where Cb0 = initial concentration of bacteria in the bead.Using the initial conditions that at t=0, the initial concentration in the bead is zero, Cg=0:The constant Km can be determined by the data obtained in the wet-lab.The second term accounts for the promoter\u0092s sensitivity to copper.Thus we reduced each system to a single equation which describes the rate of protein production under each promoter:The first term represents leakage expression due to random fluctuations in the binding and unbinding of repressor molecules to the promoter.The beads consist of a chitosan coating containing the bacteria to be administered to the patient.(6) Gudipaty, S et al (2014) The histidine kinase CusS senses silver ions through direct binding by its sensor domain, Biochim.However, this is true only under an assumption that the chemical bindings are uncooperative - independent to each other.Our chelators, Csp1 and MymT has 52 and 8 copper binding sites respectively.Now that we have obtained all necessary values we can see how long it will take for the bacteria in the beads to be released.From the graphs we can see that it takes approximately 500 minutes (around 8.5 hours) for over 90% of the drug to fully diffuse into the gut.(2016) In silico modelling of mass transfer & absorption in the human gut, Journal of Food Engineering 176, pp.We also must assume that the beads are equally-sized and perfectly spherical and also that the intestine can be treated as a straight tube with an average flow speed of 1cm/s.The constant P1 is the half-saturating concentration of ligand, and so can be interpreted as an averaged dissociation constant.These bindings are cooperative, and a close approximation is formalised in the Hill function shown where Y denotes the fractional saturation of total copper binding sites.The rate of diffusion depends on Km, the mass transfer coefficient.We must assume that the thickness of the bead coating is such that none of the bacteria is released before reaching the intestine.In the latter two models, we applied fluid dynamics to model advection and diffusion.Hence the boundary condition for the above equation is:Assuming the flow is laminar, the concentration will have a parabolic profile in the radial direction.The simulation time was equal to the time a meal would spend in the gut (~11hours).The data fit only worked for pCusC, where it showed a satisfying increase in the exponential growth phase of E Coli.We wanted to gain an understanding of how effective our bacteria would be in the gut.However, this is mainly due to the fact that we didn\u0092t know the exact steady state amount of CueR and CueR*.The wet lab experimentation has demonstrated that the beads will survive the conditions of the stomach with no leakage from the bead so we can consider this assumption to be true.The conclusion of this model is that the beads designed in the lab will work.", "notebook": "cg and pg in shipping plasmid \u0096 using EcoRI and

fluorescence and composite channels (bottom)We also received a part containing a copper biosensor: pCusC mKate, from Tom Folliard, a PhD student in our lab.However we wanted to get a similar sequence

attempted to show that our two copper chelating proteins chelated copper when expressed from E. coli.We believe that two possibilities were likely:Copper chelation by the chelator reduces the free copper concentration inside the cell meaning that less binds to the His tag and the fluorescence lifetime will be greater than a His-tagged sfGFP controlCopper chelation by the chelator would allow additional quenching if copper was bound within the quenching radius of the fluorophore leading to a reduction in fluorescence lifetime compare with a sfGFP controlLacking access to a fluorescence lifetime microscope ourselves we contacted Cardiff iGEM who had a FLIM machine in their bioimaging unit.This was also the case for the parts pCopA MymT with plasmid constitutive CueR, pCopA MymT-sfGFP with plasmid constitutive CueR and pCopA Csp1-sfGFP with plasmid constitutive CueR.Mathematical modeling by our dry lab suggested that with cells producing a reasonable amount of chelator (105/cell) at a normal cell density (108/ml) then even assuming maximum chelator binding then the drop in copper concentration using this protocol would be below the detection limit of the assay.While not directly comparable to our other parts due to the different fluorescent protein this promoter turned out to be much more sensitive and responsive than any of the CueR systems: Plate reader data after four hours (top left), flow cytometry data (top right), microscopy images for differential interference contrast, fluorescence and composite channels (bottom)We attempted to make a positive feedback system based upon pCusC.After further attempts however we could not convincingly show copper chelation by our in vitro protein samples.The chelators we used for purification had a C-terminal sfGFP-tagged connected via a short, hydrophilic linker to aid folding and a His tag was attached to the sfGFP.These both appeared more copper responsive than the pCopA promoter alone although the much larger TAT Csp1 appeared to have expression issues at higher copper concentrations forming inclusion bodies seen in the microscopy images: Plate reader data after four hours (top left), flow cytometry data (top right), microscopy images for differential interference contrast, fluorescence and composite channels (bottom)Plate reader data after four hours (top left), flow cytometry data (top right), microscopy images for differential interference contrast, fluorescence and composite channels (bottom)We wanted to experiment with the CueR-system further by adding in a feedback loop.We would design and test a part like this if we had more time.We discovered an innovative paper by Hotzer et al(3) that described how His-tagged GFP can be quenched by a copper ion binding to this His tag leading to a reduction in the fluorescence lifetime (the time the fluorophore spends in the excited state before returning to the ground state by emitting a photon).Our copper chelator parts (Copper storage protein 1 (Csp1), Csp1sfGFP, mycobacterial metallothionein (MymT) and MymTsfGFP) lacked a promoter so had to be ligated into the arabinose-inducible pBAD His B commercial expression plasmid for characterisation.They speculated that this could potentially be used as a in vivo copper assay.A representation of the suggested quenching mechanism of the GFP fluorohore via His-tag bound copper ionAs we had His-tagged our chelator-sfGFP constructs we were curious to see if this technique could be applied to our parts to measure copper chelation in vivo by our parts.Initially, small bacterial cell cultures of E. coli MG1655, containing our parts MymT-sfGFP and Csp1-sfGFP, (10 ml) were grown overnight with arabinose at a concentration that allowed maximal induction of the chelators  expression (1.5mM).As MymT-sfGFP is was observed to be reliably expressed and because MymT is a small copper cluster separated form sfGFP by a small linker we believe that this represents additional quenching of the fluorphore by MymT-bound copper showing in vivo copper chelation.Fluorescence lifetime for sfGFP, Csp1-sfGFP and MymTsfGFP from iGEM Cardiff with three repeats.This promoter alone was therefore not considered suitable for our system.Plate reader data after four hours (top left), flow cytometry data (top right), microscopy images for differential interference contrast, fluorescence and composite channels (bottom)To investigate whether this insensitivity was due to there being only a single copy of the cueR gene expressing from the cell genome compared with the 500+ copies of pCopA on the high copy plasmid we wanted to test a version of the part with plasmid expressed CueR.Flow cytometry was performed to confirm the results of the plate reader and to provide a measure of the variance in expression within each population at different copper concentrations.Microscopy was performed to qualitatively confirm the results of the previous two methods and to study the cellular localisation of the fluorescent proteins.Further details of each of these can be found on our experiments page and full protocols on our protocols page.For all of our promoter systems the results of all three experimental methods were broadly consistent.We aimed to characterise all of our promoters using three different methods:The plate reader experiments were preformed to study how the expression of the fluorescent protein changes with copper concentration and changes over time.The copper in the supernatant was assayed in a spectrometer using BCS and ascorbate.These functions were tested separately to try to understand how to design a system able to operate on physiological copper concentrations.Copper detection was investigated using promoter systems based upon the native E. coli copper regulator CueR and the CusS/CusR two component system.(1)(2) We used this to assay to test both live cells and purified proteins for the ability to reduce free copper concentration.In order to provide a long-term treatment for Wilson s disease we realised we needed to design components of a bacterial system that could detect copper and produce a copper chelators to prevent its absorption by the body.We designed a part where CueR is expressed from pCopA from a plasmid in front of sfGFP hoping that this would act as a positive feedback system increasing the sensitivity of the part.The GFP masses were known and were used to relate the \"Area\" value from ImageJ to protein amount in the band.We attempted to perform a similar assay to the live cells using the purified extract using a sample of a his-tagged GFP as a control.CueR has an mechanism of action meaning that it can operate both as a net activator or a net repressor depending on the copper concentration through interactions with RNA polymerase.We found two different copper sensitive promoter systems: CueR-linked and CusS/CusR-linked (see our parts page) and investigated rearranging the components to form feedback systems in order to improve sensitivity over the physiological range of copper concentrations.The two copper chelators we tested were Copper storage protein 1 (Csp1) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and mycobacterial metallothionein (MymT) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Throughout all of our experiments we tried to think about whether the conditions the bacteria were growing in were likely to be realistic of the gut environment, for instance in regards to pH and temperatures.These are expected to operate much like the part without the chelator if we consider the amount of copper bound by the chelator to be negligible.From this preliminary data we believe that measuring GFP fluorescence lifetime could be used as a reliable method for measuring copper concentration in vivo and that MymT displays copper chelation activity in E. coli.Hence, the beads had stabilised.The beads before hardening showing leakage of the dye:The beads with crystal violet dye before the stabilisation phaseThe beads after hardening in one calcium solution for 30mins then transferred to another for one hour with no signs of leakage:The beads with crystal violet dye after the stabilisation phase To investigate the stability of our beads within the body we decided to place the alginate-dye beads into stomach and intestine simulation solutions and measured the concentration of dye released into each solution using absorbance at 595nm.We simulated the conditions of the stomach by making up 0.2% (w/v) NaCl solution made up to pH 2.0 with 1M HCl.We repeated the same procedure with our MG1655 cells containing MymT, MymT-sfGFP, Csp1, Csp1-sfGFP in the pBAD expression system with 2mM arabinose but were unable to detect any difference between the cells and the pBAD standard curve.Instead it appears to act as negative feedback system dampening the response to copper compared to the part with constitutive expression.As the part had a Biobrick illegal SpeI restriction site in the ribosome-binding site we amplified the promoter region only so we could deposit this in the registry.If the chelator expression is too high however they may experience copper deficiency.This might be indicate that copper chelation has occurred or may be reflective of the expression problems of Csp1.When MymT-sfGFP was induced the mean lifetime decreased to 2.3ns.The protein was designed with a hexahistidine sequence at its C-terminus so Ni-NTA Agarose affinity chromatography was used to purify the protein from the cell lysate.Lacking access to a Fluorescence Lifetime IMagining (FLIM) microscope we contacted Cardiff iGEM who were kind enough to run a few of our samples in their bioimaging unit.The range of BCS colours generated by Cu+ (0 to 50?M)We researched reagents that give a coloured solution with copper to form a spectrometric copper assay.Then the actually chelator concentration would have been much lower than our measured protein concentration.Our most sincere gratitude to all those at Cardiff iGEM in particular Rob Newman for setting up the collaboration, Geraint Parry for setting up the experiment and Anthony Hayes at the bioimaging unit measuring the our parts using the FLIM microscope.Based upon patient feedback into delivery systems we decided to investigate the feasibility of using alginate beads to encase our bacteria and successfully deliver them to the intestine, while maintaining their integrity in the stomach.We based this upon a part in the registry already (see our parts page) but never managed to clone it successfully possibly due to a synthesis issue.Protein concentration of each of the samples was measured using the absorbance at 280nm and predicted extinction coefficients from ProtParam.All our promoter parts were tested in the shipping vector after being cloned into the E. coli K-12 MG1655 strain.If the copper chelator is expressed at all times then the rate of copper chelation is essentially uncontrolled and only a function of the number of bacteria present which could could feasibly vary slightly due to short-term factors such as food intake or illness.This was done to compare expression levels of each chelator (which is proportional to the fluorescence emitted since the constructs are linked to GFP).The next day, 1ml of the bacterial cell culture was transferred into fresh LB in a larger container (1L) and was grown overnight, again, at the same conditions (liquid LB low salt medium and 1.5mM arabinose).The absorbance in the medium increases in both stomach and intestine simulated solutions due to breakdown of the beads and release of the dyeThe significant increase in fluorescence of the alginate-only beads in the stomach simulated solution (where we do not want our beads to disintegrate) is shown more clearly on the \"alginate-only stomach, pH 2.0\" graph:The absorbance in the medium increases in stomach simulated solution showing that the beads are breaking downThe results suggested alginate beads would not be able to carry out bacteria successfully into the intestine, as the stomach acid would disintegrate the beads and hence kill our bacteria.These reagents detect copper in the 1+ oxidation state.Despite the fact that it was visible from the protein solution (how green the solution was under light) and the SDS gels that MG was expressed at higher levels than CG, we wanted to give the amount a quantitative value.For the fluorescence gel, whilst protein structure is mostly denatured, the fluorophore of GFP remains intact.As the mean fluorescence lifetime, rather the sample fluorescence, is measured this should be independent of the level of GFP expression.If these digests had the correct band sizes then a small volume of the undigested plasmid was sent off for sequencing.The resulting bacterial solution was treated with multiple rounds of centrifugation and sonication, to break up the cells and release the protein.The picture and table below show how the picture was processed and the results showing the amount of protein in each lane.For the denaturation gel the whole protein was denatured.If we could perform additional experiment we would measure the fluorescence lifetime of sfGFP with different overnight copper concentrations and use this to form a standard curve to which we could compare the chelator-sfGFP constructs.We spoke to patients with Wilson\u0092s disease and realised that, whilst many were comfortable with the idea of a synthetic biology treatment, the administration method for the treatment was one of their priorities.However we did produce two parts (BBa_K1980010 and BBa_K1980012) with our chelators in front of the sfGFP.The sequences were amplified using PCR and ligated into the pSB1C3 BioBrick shipping vector backbone before being cloned into E. coli DH5? strain.After attempts at site directed mutagenesis failed, we ordered this part without this site from IDT.We decided that our copper chelating bacteria would require a promoter system able to detect dietary copper rather than just constitutive expression.We investigated three designs of a promoter system based upon the CueR-linked system: One (pCopA sfGFP) was the simplest but only responsive to copper at high concentrations.This was done by adding a BspHI restriction site (an isocaudamer of NcoI) into the part at the initiator methionine using PCR.We used ImageJ to measure the pixel density (learn more about the process in the Protocols page) of the GFP standards, draw a curve and map the pixel density values of the chelator lanes.We then added 2ml of the dye.Correctly sequenced parts were then kept for testing and deposition in the registry.The fluorescence gel with the lanes highlighted in yellow boxes for processing.Table showing the results for each lane.)FLIM images captured from each of the three arabinose induced slides.With more time we hoped to develop the assay further.We also came across a paper by H\u00f6tzer et al(3) that detailed how it might be possible to use the fluorescence lifetime of a His tagged GFP as a copper assay.The pBAD expression vector contains a copy of ?-lactamase gene allowing cells with the plasmid to have ampicillin resistance.We found during their first 30 minutes in the CaCl2 solution (the \u0093stabilisation phase\u0094) dye did leak from the beads.Consequently ampicillin was used for all transformations using these parts.One of our promoter parts (pCopA sfGFP with plasmid divergent CueR) was sequenced four times from separate PCR and transformation attempts and had the same two point mutations on each attempt.This also seems to have reduced the variation between cells as shown by the flow cytometer data.This increases selection pressure for the gene to mutate out and decreases the likelihood of our bacteria strain being able to successfully compete with other gut bacteria.The area value refers to the area under the curve created as pixel density changes when you move from the top to the bottom of each yellow rectangle.From their feedback we investigated small alginate beads, layered with chitosan to allow survival in the stomach, as a method of probiotic delivery.", "safety": "By ensuring that both a specific copper concentration and temperature would need to be met to allow expression, we impose a safety mechanism on our bacteria that means that, outside of the gut when the temperature drops below 37\u00b0C, our bacteria would not act abnormally relative to an unmodified strain.Although we hope that our therapeutic would reside in the intestine, human faeces contain live gut bacteria, so there is the possibility that our live probiotic could escape the confines of the body and be released to the environment.The large population of bacteria required to be ingested for use as a therapeutic probiotic may contain a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes that could influence the presence and establishment of antibiotic resistance genes in the body(6).This was a key safety aspect of our project: as the importance of the gut microbiome has become increasingly evident in recent years(1)(2), and we do not want our probiotic to damagingly disrupt it.E.Furthermore, E. coli Nissle 1917 has actually been shown to successfully outcompete intestinal pathogens to form biofilms in the gut(8), meaning that our probiotic should be safe to consumer, and may actually have additional advantageous effects on patients.Please use the sidebar to navigate.Interaction with the body<font

the environment</font> Before we were allowed to enter the laboratory, we were given a briefing by the departmental Safety Officer, Steve Curnock.Probiotic bacteria have been shown, in rare cases, to have a severe pathogenic effect: resulting in conditions such as bacteremia (bacterial infection of the blood) and endocarditis (bacterial infection of the inner lining of the heart).This tied into our safety research into the pathogenicity of a possible treatment.In the case of our therapeutic, inputs 1 and 2 could be copper concentration and temperature, as discussed above.These risks can vary depending on the bacteria and strain, but little is known about the extent to which they may affect a patient due to insufficient research into the safety of most probiotic strains.When researching possible delivery method for our probiotic, we had to consider the risks associated with the different possible delivery methods.This is advantageous to our treatment however, as we want our bacteria to successfully compete to remain in the gut.Chassis choice plays a key part in the safety and longevity of our potential probiotic.When investigating public perception on GMOs and their use as a possible medical treatment, some members of the public made clear to us that that they found the idea of ingesting bacteria \u0093off-putting\u0094 and were concerned about safety - bacteria are usually viewed as \u0093bad\u0094.We had to consider the potential impact of this when considering There are a variety of ways in which our bacteria may become dangerous, requiring a rapid end to the treatment.As our ultimate goal is for a therapeutic to be able to stably reside in the gut for significant periods of time, we had to consider how it might interact with the gut microbiome.Below is a diagram summarising the potential hazards and the solutions we have considered and/or integrated into the design of our project as a result.An extension of this would be the use of the \u0091Passcode\u0092 kill switch(9).One of the potential causes of this may be the ability of these bacteria to modulate the innate immune response(5).Alternatively, as bacteria are living organisms, with a relatively high replication rate, there is the possibility that dangerous mutations may occur that We considered the possibility of bacteria escaping the confines of the body when developing our potential therapeutic.As with any newly developing therapeutic, the potentials risks to a patient, and how these can be minimised, are constantly on the minds of the researchers.Hence, we decided that our therapeutic would have to be delivered orally, to reduce the risk to the patient.(2013) \u0091Role of the gut microbiota in health and chronic gastrointestinal disease: Understanding a hidden metabolic organ\u0092, Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology, 6(4), pp.Any synthetic biology project has associated risks, but these become significantly larger when the ultimate aim of the project is to introduce these bacteria into a human.However, this is not currently a concern within our project as our modelling suggest that the maximum theoretical degree of chelation is still below the excess level that is ingested by Wilson\u0092s Disease patients.We spoke to a Professor of Evolutionary Biology, Kevin Foster, about the distribution of bacteria in the intestine and he advised us to investigate several well-studied probiotic species.He informed us of all the potential risks and dangers associated with the use of different chemicals, techniques, and equipment, and how we could minimise these risks.Although considered to be widely safe(3), certain risks are associated with the use of probiotics.A bacterial toxin has the potential to seriously harm a patient, so this was a serious safety concern that we considered as we designed our project.With regards to safety, we have considered three main areas: interaction with the body, interaction with the gut microbiome, and exposure to the environment.As with any novel treatment, we must consider the potential effects of the treatment outside of the role we are designing it for.We considered the potential pathogenicity, toxigenicity and Pathogenicity refers to the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.Following this, we were given a laboratory induction by our supervisor, who demonstrated the safest and most efficient ways to carry out the protocols we would require.A unique feature of probiotic therapeutics is that they are live when administered, and hence have the potential to produce toxins in situ.The level of pathogenic bacteria in sewage sludge varies depending on the stabilisation procedures at different sewage treatment plants, with research suggesting that further optimisation of water purification methods are required(10).(2009) \u0091The non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 \u0096 features of a versatile probiotic\u0092, Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease, 21(3-4), pp.We ultimately decided that our final chassis would be E. coli Nissle 1917, although we would carry out our experimentation in E. coli K-12 MG1655 Although we were unable to produce a bacterium containing a kill switch due to time restraints, we had originally designed our expression system in such a way that all potential risks were minimised.D\u0092Argenio, V. and Salvatore, F. (2015) \u0091The role of the gut microbiome in the healthy adult status\u0092,Clinica Chimica Acta, 451, pp.Toxigenicity refers to the ability of a bacterium to produce a toxin.Furthermore, the ability of E. coli Nissle 1917 to form biofilms increases its long term persistence in the gut.Sonnenborn, U. and Schulze, J.Matsuzaki, T. and Chin, J.(2000) \u0091Modulating immune responses with probiotic bacteria\u0092,Immunology and Cell Biology, 78(1), pp.Consideration of safety has been a big part of our project ever since its inception, before even entering the lab we had to complete a GMO saftey assessment for approval by the Departmental Safety Committee.(2013) \u0091Antibiotic resistance in probiotic bacteria\u0092, Frontiers in (7).Should these genes be passed to pathogenic strains found in the intestine, the result on the health of the patient could be drastic.A variety of bacteria colonise the human intestine, we wanted to choose the safest and most useful species for our probiotic.", "keywords": "cementation penicillin microfluidic Synechocystis killswitch lipolytica concentration fluorescence chloroplast synthetase ", "track": "Therapeutics", "part_favorite":

their use as a micro-plant to produce product for our own interest, and the potential misused of the technology.Moreover, with the rise of big data, ownership and collection of biological data are likely to be hot topics in a close future as laws and regulations are not up to date with the potential issues to come.Building a safer project to contribute to the industrial use of synthetic biology

help future teams but also encourage them to think about their own way to develop safer experimentations that could lead one step toward industrial use of synbio!Another course was scheduled for High School students regarding Synthetic Biology, iGEM and human genetics.These events at the elementary school of Yvris and the High School of Flora Tristan allowed not only an exchange of knowledge but also a human experience for our team.We designed this application in order to communicate and popularize Synthetic Biology.BactMan Adventures is a mobile application popularizing science through educative mini-games around the life of a bacteria.Available on Android systems and respecting the open source philosophy of the iGEM, our mobile application development has been conducted in order to create an educational but still fun game in order to make people of any background more likely to get informed about biotechnology and synthetic biology.By working on a kill-switch triggered by light, we also hope synthetic biology projects would be safer and could be used more commonly in closed bioreactor, preventing any spreading but allowing society and people to benefit of the many solutions made possible by genetic engineering.As this year the main goal of the IONIS iGEM team was to popularize Synthetic Biology, we have challenged other iGEM teams and asked them to create a one minute video introducing their project in the simplest way.Other broader topics are available such as \u0093Lab Safety: The Interactive Game of Don\u0092t Endanger the Owls\u0094 (Rice University) or \u0093Science at the Polls: Biology for Voters\u0094, whose aim is to provide every citizens with the basic knowledge required to be an aware voters (University of Berkeley).Making an exhaustive list of all the biology courses available online would be an endless task as each month new courses are available while some are removed.Nowadays, Synthetic Biology is a real challenge in the scientific world, and we are all affected.Aware of the need to communicate and share about Synthetic Biology, a new team has been created this year: IONIS Paris.This will of IONIS iGEM to popularize Biology and Synthetic Biology gathers several proposals and projects which are presented in the following parts.According to IONIS iGEM main goals, the team has organized some introduction courses for elementary schools on DNA, the living organisms (using the tree of life) and as all the little students were really interested and excited, the team also scheduled to perform a little experiment in order to extract banana s DNA.You can work in the morning or late at night: it is up to you!These classes can also fit the various learning style of students: if you have trouble learning alone, the community will be there to help you, but you can also learn totally on your own.Many MOOC provided are free but you can still pay in order to get a verified certificate of accomplishment, therefore, knowledge and courses from prestigious university are now open to anyone.Nevertheless, people still have to develop interest in a topic in order to reach information, sometimes overcoming language barriers and finding information that remains both scientifically correct and understandable!Our purpose during the overall competition has been to bring people to understand the field, its risks and opportunities and to invite them to develop their own opinion.Please consider upgrading your browser, installing the appropriate plugin or switching to a Firefox or Chrome install.Your browser either does not

demonstrated it, in our digital area, education, through MOOC and open access are more easily available than ever.Those presentations were both rewarding for the class as well as our team: children and students were really excited and curious about the topic, and it was truly fulfilling to teach them during those sessions and turning on a sparkle of interest which may lead to a real passion for science!If these data do not show if the global opinion on GMO is negative, it however underline an interest or a concern in the area, and that most people do not seem to be willing to go deeper by understanding more about the technology behind modified organisms.Unfortunately, there is still a long way to go until synthetic engineered organisms could be used due to two main restrictions: the first one is the real risk related to the technology while the second is based on people\u0092s beliefs and fears which are often more based on some propaganda than on facts.As scientists, we are aware that the technology we are using and developing may be deviated from its original purpose or could be misused.If some websites and Youtube Channel are already providing a great popularization work such as ASAP Science, IFLS (among others) it is also possible for both beginners and long-term scientists to use social network to learn about the actuality of their field, to get in touch with others and to debate about new ideas.The scientific community is especially active on this site and is dedicated to explain through constructed argumentations all the concepts you have ever wondering about.Twitter can also be a great tool in order to get in touch with scientists and companies and debate!Either you are a scientist or not, you may not have heard about those terms before but you definitely will in the future.Open science is a movement whose aims are to increase transparency of research, increase its public availability and accessibility through open access and open data, and to promote scientific collaborations in order for anyone to have the tools to contribute to scientific progress.Which lead us to the following statement:  How and why should the synthetic biology research take advantages of new digital trends for its popularization and for the education of citizens from all background?In addition, you can also find basic biology or bioinformatics lessons as well as other classes such as Engineering Life: Synbio, Bioethics & Public Policy; Experimental genomic sciences, Epigenomics; Neurosciences or Plant Biology!With some of the best universities in the world, this platform is providing many courses on biology from beginners to advanced levels.Thus, it is fundamental that people get informed to make an informed decision on what they want, and the only way to prepare them, to treat the source of the problem, is to provide them education through popularization and open science!Thus, combining this high-tech support to a game seems great to get people interested in the potential application of such systems.Some noteworthy classes proposed here have been provided by the MIT and Harvard, from \u0093Introduction to biology\u0094 to \u0093Principles of Synthetic Biology\u0094.Let\u0092s make a quick review of the major MOOC platforms and their offer in biology and especially synthetic biology classes!This objective in our mind, we chose to develop our project through different supports and strategies.Gamification is a recent term describing the use of game-like designs and mechanisms in order to facilitate the understanding of non-fun topic, to motivate and engage people in theirs tasks.Will we contribute to the cheap production of a medicine for a third-world country?However, to ensure the safety of our system, test on the rapidity of the death activation after light exposure should be performed and modeled before being used in industrial conditions.Please consider upgrading your browser, installing the appropriate plugin or switching to a Firefox or Chrome install.During our first brainstorming sessions, all our members were truly excited about what our project will be.Will we cure patient from a growing infectious disease that is spreading and devastating the world?The reference used as 100 is the highest volume of request recorded for a defined keyword.When looking for synthetic biology classes, Coursera proposes 3 specializations which are specific cursus in which you follow different courses on a topic leading to a validate certificate.In addition, the Bio-Console is not expected to be an industrial scale project and the demonstration of the microfluidic device does not necessarily require the use of bacteria to reach its popularization purpose.By organizing TEDtalks conferences that are freely available online, this organization is contributing to the popularization of many topics from science, psychology, new technology or global actualities.For those who are not willing to follow a full class on a topic but still want to improve their understanding of science and other ethical matters, TED is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote \u0093ideas worth spreading\u0094.We debated this problematic and came to the conclusion that making bacteria a playful companion in a game of fluid and light would not harm neither the organisms, neither environment nor human beings.In our perspective, if it\u0092s a right to have access to knowledge, it is our duty to be well informed when talking about such cutting-edge technologies.Those videos were challenging for all teams, indeed, introducing its own project in only one minute is short.Your browser either does not support HTML5 or cannot handle MediaWiki open video formats.By going through the many projects from the previous iGEM competitors we realized something: all those ideas were truly brilliant however, almost none of them could be implemented in the real world, and therefore could solve the problems mentioned above.In this perspective, the website Quora is allowing people to ask questions and to receive answers from the world experts on the topic!Bioinformatics is taught by the University of California, San Diego, through 6 courses covering hidden message in DNA, evolution and big data in biology.As an example, the key word \u0093biological engineering\u0094 is more used in China than anywhere in the world.Using key words and research request archives from the famous searching engine, this tool generates time line graphs by representing the amount of request in which the given key word has been used on different period of time.Please consider upgrading your browser, installing the appropriate plugin or switching to a Firefox or Chrome install.The iGEM competition is a great example of open science.With a large offer of free classes, Coursera is a great place to start learning about biology and synbio.IONIS Paris team, gathers students with different backgrounds in order to propose a new way to popularize biology and synthetic biology.Still, our main objective was to ensure that our system would be safe of use by two kinds of \u0093game over\u0094 to make sure no spreading would occur when using the console.However, some ethical concerns were raised from our choice: should we \u0093play\u0094 with living organisms like in our game?To conclude, our team believe scientists and citizens must work together because ethical and environmental issues related to synthetic biology are concerning everyone.Your browser either does not support HTML5 or cannot

Endolysin/Holin) Miniprep test using liquid culture of Terminator T7 and RBS to check the efficiency of miniprep kit from QIAgen and MOBIOBands have more migrated than expected but it could be due to the folding of circular plasmid.Confirmation of a new restriction site into pDawn PCR  We get expected bands but, as for second PCRs of VVD and YN155 fragments, bands 2 time heavier than expected bands appeared After the last Gibson reaction we have get red colonies that should correspond to bacteria transformed with pSB1C3-RFP (which should be impossible after the gel migration and purification).About pDawn III PCR 2, the migration of 5 \u00b5l from the gel extraction of PCR products have shown that there is not a high quantity of DNA material, not enough for a Gibson assembly\u0085  We get confirmation of the presence of pSB1C3 and our part, but there is still the unknown band.Red colonies there is still some RFP into the tube with purified/digested pSB1C3 DNA

VVD-YN155, GFP rev, Holin/Endolysin rev (H/E rev), CCDB rev, HOKD rev) VVD-YN: bands at 2000 bp only or 2000 bp and 1000 bp (profile of pSB1C3 with RFP) no partpDawn: bands at 2000 bp only or 2000 bp and 1000 bp (profile of pSB1C3 with RFP) no part Liquid culture (2 from the negative control, 7 colonies from pDawn plates and 6 from VVD-YN 155 plates).Transformation of 50\u00b5l of competent cells with 1 \u00b5l of pUC19 following our protocolWe get expected bands at approximatively 2000 bp and 750 bp, but it still an extra band at 1500 bp (already present during the previous electrophoresis).Simple digestions have shown that no other unexpected restriction site have appeared during PCR amplification of each fragment We get 2 bands after the digestion of pDawn meaning a non-expected restriction site appeared into the sequence during the PCR useless to answer biobrick standard requirement.The profile of the Gibson digestion correspond to pSB1C3 with the RFP (totally unexpected since we have purifies the digested backbone).BBa_K1159001: we get 2 on 3 expected bands, confirmation of the structure of the plasmid with a pBad promoter (not indicated on the registry) before the nanoluc gene.Induction of BBa_K325909 and BBa_K1159001 with a solution of arabinose 1%, and a solution of IPTG 1 mM for T7-Nanoluc (should correspond to the effect of a constitutive promoter like T7).Effect of the concentration of arabinose inducer to the light intensity of BBa_K1159001 part.Incubate 5h at 30\u00b0C; for BBa_K325909, measure the kinetic during the 5h of induction and take the maximum value  Measure kinetic over 120 min and take maximum value for culture with BBa_K1159001 and T7-nanoluc When the OD600 has reached 0.6 or more, the volume of culture has been divided into 3 erlenmeyers: All colonies exhibits same profile under same condition of light exposition and temperature.While the concentration of IPTG does not exceed 1 mM, the light intensity remains low.", "protocol": "", "result": "It results in different light intensities proportional to the concentration of IPTG: the more IPTG you have, the brighter!Comparison of the relative light unit using 3 differents Biobricks:Induction of BBa_K325909 and BBa_K1159001 with a solution of arabinose 1%, and a solution of IPTG 1 mM for T7-Nanoluc.We compared our new T7 Nanoluc to the first Luxbrick created by Cambridge in 2010 (BBa_K325909), and to BBa_K1159001.In our prototype of the Bio-Console, this bubble does not contain any enginneered bacteria, but as we firstly imagined it, it should have contained one.However, we wanted to insert a red filter in order not to activate the biological systems (VVD construction and liposomes) as well as a white flash that could be triggered by the informatical code of the game when it is game over.That is why, our team wanted to complete and improve the registry by creating a new one.Moreover, we noticed that the BBa_K1159001 (a nanoLuc construction from Munich-2013) characterization missed the concentration of arabinose to add for the induction, in order to get the same results, which are really good.BBa_K1159001 light intensity is linked to the percentage of arabinose.Light intensity has been measured 5 hours after induction with arabinose or IPTG depending on the Biobrick, when DO 600 was between 0,6 and 0,8.Please consider upgrading your browser, installing the appropriate plugin or switching to a Firefox or Chrome install.Here you can see the entry of the bubble in the circuit and its detection.Nevertheless, we achieved our goal to create a prototype of the Bio-Console and our system works as expected.However, over 1% of arabinose, the intensity does not increase anymore.T7 NanoLuc showed a 1,2 times brighter light intensity (RLU) than BBa_K1159001 and a light intensity approximately 140 times brighter than BBa_K325909.In the same experiment, we also improved the characterization of BBa_K1159001.Incubation at room temperature with white-light illumination allowed better folding of HE and had a stronger effect on the growth of bacteria.Our system of microfluidic chip is designed in a way that it has 2 entries and 1 exit.The entries allow the fluids to enter the system and they enable both physical and informatical engines to control the movement of the fluids (water and blue colorant in one entry and oil with a really low viscosity in an other one).After a suitable positionning of the chip under the microscope according to the \u0093Fluigent\u0094 design, the player can begin the game by creating a blue bubble of the mixture water and colorant in the main fluid: the oil.Indeed, the creation and implementation of the code took longer than expected as a consequence of some difficulties to manage to realize a code able to detect the bubble at the beginning of the game.For the others, we added NanoGlow substrate from Promega (ratio 1:1), measured kinetics over 120 min and took the maximum value.This part was inserted into native pDawn for characterization of the Biobrick.Bacteria expressing pDawn-HE were prepared in a pre-culture until DO600 reached a value between 0,6 and 0,8.As expected, we managed to settle the draining and the waste disposal systems.Bba_K325909 already has the substrate synthesis within its sequence, therefore we only had to measure the kinetic during 5h of induction and took the maximum value.For this purpose, the waste is collected in a tube containing bleach allowing adapted decontamination of biological samples.It was planned to transport the Bio-Console in a 3D printed box, but several technical problems occured with the 3D printer, as a result the machine didn\u0092t achieve the printing of the container.Thus, addition of IPTG activates the induction of the Plac promoter and then expression of T7 RNA polymerase is possible.BBa_K1159001 showed a light intensity approximately 140 times brighter than BBa_K325909 at equivalent inducer concentration.As mentioned above, we also further characterized the NanoLuc construct of iGEM Munich 2013 by analyzing its expression under different percentage of arabinose.In addition, the absence of the systems we imagined in order not to activate the biological systems can be overcomed by the use of bioluminescence as the way of vizualisation.Nevertheless we can assure you that playing with the Bio-Console is still funny!Moreover, the association of the code and the Fluigent\u0092s technology also took longer than expected.We observed that no references were performed for the characterization of the BBa_K1159001.At each game over the draining is automatically triggered.We look throughout the registry and we did not find any part containing a Nanoluc coupled with a T7 promoter.", "safety": "To be sure that any bacteria are able to leave the game different measure have been taken; a kill-switch, a killing-liposome and a hermetic microfluidic chip.That is very interesting as we could create a game over in our Bio Console, once we trigger the bacteria\u0092s death through light.It is important for us to avoid any possibility of escaping from our microfluidic chip.The Kill switch would permit to contain our genetically modified bacteria into the chip through lethality.", "keywords": "luciferase encouraged references temperature

transcription rate of genes in downstream of Pconst ($TC_{pconst}$), translation rate of protein (GFP) ($TL$), half-life of mRNA ($HL_{mRNA}$), half-life of GFP ($HL_{GFP}$), maturation time of GFP ($MT$), cell cycle ($CYCLE$) and length of activation period of Pnrd ($PNRD$), by parameter fitting.In the experiment using Pnrd, the time series of concentration of mRNA encoding GFP, immature GFP protein, and mature GFP protein would be described by following differential equations.$$frac{d[mathrm{mRNA}]}{dt} = TC_{pnrd} - frac{ln{2}}{HL_{mRNA}} [mathrm{mRNA}] mathrm{(with Pnrd)} $$$$frac{d[mathrm{mRNA}]}{dt} = - frac{ln{2}}{HL_{mRNA}} [mathrm{mRNA}] mathrm{(without Pnrd)} $$$$frac{d[mathrm{imGFP}]}{dt} = TL [mathrm{mRNA}] - [mathrm{imGFP}] frac{ln{2}}{HL_{GFP}} - frac{ln{2}}{MT} [mathrm{imGFP}] $$$$frac{d[mathrm{GFP}]}{dt} = frac{ln{2}}{MT} [mathrm{imGFP}] - frac{ln{2}}{HL_{GFP}} [mathrm{GFP}] $$In the experiment using Pconst, differential equations of mRNA would be described as follows.The order of each parameter is estimated referring to various literature (Parameter Estimation).Also, we estimated parameters using the data obtained from our experiment (Parameter Fitting).The model of the genetic circuit we designed generated correct loops under certain parameters sets and did not generate under other parameters sets.Therefore, it seems theoretically possible for the genetic circuit designed in our project to behave as expected.For example, the result of simulation using certain parameters (Parameter Set A in Section 4) is below.The code (samplechart.java) simulates behavior of 30 generations, so if ten loops of three generations (GFP dominant, RFP dominant and CFP dominant) appears, it means the genetic circuit works successfully.It follows that under this parameter set, the loop designed does not work, that is, the genetic circuit does not function as intended.We judged whether the expression loops were generated successfully or not, on the basis of the graph outputted by our simulation tool mentioned in the former section.However, this way of judgement is objectively doubtful slightly since there are not mathematical criteria to judge.We conducted an objective analysis of the stability of the loop.If a tool is developed which outputs the result of stability analysis according to the inputted parameters, it helps us to judge the stability of genetic circuit (whether the loop is stable independently of initial states and perturbation of concentration of the factors) under various parameter sets and choose the factor to use in the genetic circuit.Now this code enables us to judge whether the circuit generates stable expression loops under various sets of parameters obtained from literature or experiment.The tool explained in chapter 1 and 2 enabled us to examine in advance whether the gene expression loop would be stable with a parameter set of the expression, decomposition rates, etc.Therefore, it is appropriate to judge that the loop works as designed.On the other hand, under certain different parameters (Parameter Set B in Section 4), the result of this simulation became the graph below.In this graph, each curve does not have just ten peaks.Therefore, the ratio of inhibited sigma-factor to all sigma-factors is expressed by the following formula including the Hill equation.$K\u0092$ means the dissociation constant between sigma-factor and anti-sigma-factor.It follows that the gene transcription rate of sigma-promoter is proportional to the Hill equation of activated sigma-factor,[sigma] frac{1 - frac{[anti-{sigma}]}{K\u0092 + [anti-{sigma}]}}{ K + [sigma](1 - frac{[anti-{sigma}]}{K\u0092 + [anti-{sigma}]})}The transcription of the mRNA of sigma-factor A under pbad can also be described using Hill equation.The ratio of mRNA which is translated into proteins to whole mRNA with toehold switch (the rate of mRNA whose hairpin structure around RBS is broken by triggerRNA) is proportional to the following formula including the Hill equation.$K\u0092\u0092$ means the dissociation constant between triggerRNA and hairpin structure around RBS.The decomposition rate of a certain substance whose half-life is HL is log2/HL.Therefore, the increase rate of concentration of mRNA at T hours does not depend on a concentration of sigma-factor and anti-sigma-factor at T hours, but on at (T - s) hours.Similarly, it also takes some time (put this as t hours) to synthesize one molecule of protein from mRNA.If there is a tool which can calculates the behavior of genetic circuit with any parameter sets inputted and outputs a graph indicating time series of concentration of fluorescent proteins, it is useful for judging whether genetic circuit works as intended when we get the actual parameters from experiments or literature.If we had conducted more experiment and obtained more data, there was a likelihood that the result of this parameter fitting converged to a certain set of parameters.We referred to the table below to decide parameters.Therefore, the task of our developed tool is judging the existence of fixed point X satisfying both condition A and B.The analysis tool first finds X satisfying condition A, subsequently check if the fixed point X satisfies condition B or not.of gene)\u0093Modulation of Chemical Composition and

RegulatedEscherichia coli Ribonucleotide Reductase Expression is Cell Cycle RegulatedIn addition, we referred to this paper to know parameters related to sigma factors or anti-sigma factors.Rhodius, V. A., Segall?Shapiro, T. H., Sharon, B. D., Ghodasara, A., Orlova, E., Tabakh, H., ... & Voigt, C. A.While condition B means fluctuated states (concentration of each factor) from a fixed point will go back to the fixed point as time passed, it is a condition for the loop to maintain stably regardless of the initial state and fluctuation in E. coli.And also it is expected that we can get the insight for improving our design of the genetic circuit using this simulation.The second one is to check whether genetic circuit works as intended under the given condition when parameters are obtained from experiment.The code is below.The code above (Stability.java) judged that the expression loop is stable when we inputted a certain parameter set which made a positive result when simulated (Parameter Set A in the Section 4).For, when inputted the same data for several times, outputted parameters were different every time.We considered that the result of this parameter fitting did not converge to a valid parameter set simply because there were too many unknown parameters to estimate from the finite amount of data.The parameters that we could not obtain from the experiment were estimated from literature.Simulation of Time Series of Concentration of Fluorescent ProteinWe ran the simulation of the transcription and translation for two reasons.s and t are also parameters.This is a source code of our tool which calculates behavior of the genetic circuit by solving these differential equations paying attention to these policies.2 Simulation of Time Series of Concentration of Fluorescent Protein4 Parameters Fitting with the Results of ExperimentWe estimated the possibility that the genetic circuit works as intended by constructing mathematical modeling.Here, we assume that the maturation rate of a certain fluorescent protein is proportional to the concentration of it.Without considering activation of Pnrd in detail, we represented it as the change of way to express of triggerRNA.Paying attention to these policies, we expressed the behavior of genetic circuit by 26 nonlinear differential equations below.$$frac{dR_A}{dt}= kcdot mathrm{C}_{low}cdot frac{[sigma_A]cdot(1-frac{[sigma_{mbox{-}A}]}{K

operator  the dissociation constant between sigma-factor and anti-sigma-factor the dissociation constant between araC and arabinose  the dissociation constant between toehold switch and triggerRNA Basically, we gave positive value to initial concentration of arabinose, and gave zero to other initial values.One step of Euler approximating is 0.72 second.Using this tool, we tried various parameter sets and searched for the parameter sets which make the expression loop successful.We judged from the graph outputted by the tool under various parameter sets whether the gene expression loop was generated as intended.Therefore, the increase rate of concentration of the protein at T hours does not depend on concentration of mRNA at T hours, but on at (T - t) hours.Consequently, we adopted abnormal Euler method which calculates the concentration of each substance at T, using concentration data of s or t hours ago.First one is $P(X) - X =0$ (condition A), and the second one is eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix of $P(X) - X$, or $frac{partial (P - X)}{partial X}$(16*16 square matrix) are all negative (condition B).We also mathematically analyzed the stability of the expression loops, and the parameters which make the loops stable were found with this analysis.We conducted parameter fitting with the data which we got from experiment, in order to estimate the parameters that we used in our simulation.Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 237(20), 2616-2627.We excluded the fluorescent proteins and mRNA encoding them from this analysis, because they do not affect the stability of the expression loop of sigma factor and anti-sigma factors.For this reason, we referred just the order of the parameters.\u0093Modulation of Chemical Composition and Other Parameters of the Cell by Growth Rate\u0094A forward-design approach to increase the production of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate in genetically engineered Escherichia coli32nM/min(Transcription rate(6) in E.coli/ conc.If X represents a state of a cell which is at the start of cell cycle, the state of the cell three cell cycles later can be represented as P(X).This judgement mathematically supports our expectation that the genetic circuit generates stable expression loops under valid parameter sets.The transcription rate of a gene, under a certain promoter which starts transcription by binding a certain sigma factor, is proportional to the following formula including the Hill equation when?no anti-sigma-factors exist.$K$ is the dissociation constant between sigma-factor and promoter.If anti-sigma-factor exists, it inhibits the activity of sigma-factor.To examine the influence of this fluctuation to the result of simulation, we added random numbers that follow normal distribution to transcription and translation rate every step of Euler approximation.Second one is introduction of delay of transcription and translation.So we developed the tool.We described the behavior of the genetic circuit by differential equations and developed a tool solving the differential equations with Euler s method.In this aranged algorithm, cost function is norm of P(X)-X and the population are composed of candidates of X. P(X) is calculated by numerical integral, Euler method.The process of judging condition B is done in this way.So we developed the tool.We developed a tool which judges the stability of gene expression loop mathematically using a parameter set mentioned in \u0093method\u0094 paragraph in Chapter 1.We conducted this analysis referring to these papers including similar analysis.Tanaka, G., Tsuji, S., & Aihara, K. (2009).Therefore, we experimented with real E. coli strain, growth environment and other factors to find parameters which are suited to the simulation with the tool.We did two experiments.Molecular systems biology, 9(1), 702.The instances of the parameter sets that we mentioned in the Section 1 and 2 are as follows.We also conducted another simulation that positive values were given to other initial values to make sure that the initial state makes little difference to the result of simulation.We applied two ideas to imitate genuine environment in living E. coli instead of just solving the differential equation.The source code of the tool is this.We inputted the data from the experiments mentioned above into our parameter fitting tool, but unfortunately, meaningful output was not acquired.In real bacteria cell, the rate of transcription and translation is not constant and it fluctuates a little.First, we simulated time series of concentration of each fluorescent protein to find parameters which establish expression loops of them.Differential equations of GFP proteins would be same as above.$$frac{d[mathrm{mRNA}]}{dt} = TC_{pconst} - frac{ln{2}}{HL_{mRNA}} [mathrm{mRNA}]$$We fitted measured value with these equations with an algorithm called \u0093differential evolution\u0094.The concentration of GFP estimated from fluorescent strength is shown in the table below.Vector X and fixed points are mentioned below paragraphs.We put concentration of sigma-factor A, B, C, anti-sigma factor A, B, C, mRNA encoding sigma-factor A, B, C (without toehold switch), mRNA encoding sigma-factor A, B, C (with toehold switch), mRNA encoding anti-sigma factor A, B, C as x1, x2, ...., x16, respectively.Condition A means the state of E. coli does not change after three generations and it is a necessary condition for gene expression loop of three generations.The proportionality constant of maturation rate of a certain fluorescent protein whose maturation time is MT is log2/MT, on the analogy of decomposition rate.We represented the activation of Pnrd which is the key of this circuit as a short pulse wave occurring once a cell cycle.", "notebook":

to profit off of our intellectual property rights, and that we would only consider obtaining rights if it would benefit all nations even those of lower economic standing.As scientists, it is not only our obligation to develop this technology but to communicate our findings to the public.The first ten minutes were dedicated to a presentation on the science of a GMO food.In short, our technology has the opportunity to impact a diverse group of people holding varying cultural, religious, and educational backgrounds.Our team found the small-scale discussion was effective and left some people with a dramatically different opinion on GMO food.The rest of the time was a facilitated discussion.Unfortunately, a lot of synthetic biology applications have poor public perception, and we must take responsibility for this and attempt to reverse these attitudes.Most people had issues with how businesses were using the science at the expense of farmers.In the United States, we discovered through further research that obtaining a patent for a life science product is difficult to obtain.Our goal was to address the social stigma behind genetically modified food by presenting the scientific facts while also engaging with people directly about their opinions on the practice.Instead of writing people off as stupid if they disagree with you, a simple discussion may lead to more productive results.In addition, respecting that someone may have religious or cultural opposition to the science you are doing is a huge part of engaging in ethical practice.Synthetic biology offers the possibility of making technological innovation accessible to a diversity of people.Our program took place in the lounge of a residence hall on campus and lasted an hour.At first people seemed against

risk of short bowel syndrome.Actually I think that particular case is not the key point, and learning some common sense about the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.A2: Nowadays, treating Inflammatory intestinal diseases is still a difficult problem over the whole world, mainly in terms of poor response to drug therapy for some patients, recurrence after treatment and serious adverse reactions after a long-term drug therapy.And biologics has a high risk of infection and may exists the probability of drug resistance.A2: Disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases is mainly about: 1. lack of effective drugs for all patients, even if the biological agents which is researched and developed in recent years and whose efficacy is only about 50%.We would appreciate it if you can offer us some details about some cases caused by inflammatory intestinal disease and patients\u0092 following development.A1: Inflammatory intestinal diseases is an important type of intestinal disease, which is one of the priorities of our work here at Department of Gastroenterology.We really hope that this is the beginning of another amazing adventure!During the investigation of intestinal diseases, we realized that IBD is a world-wide threat to human health with a great morbidity and severity.One of the most prominent disease is intestinal diseases.Therefore, we strived to integrate human practice activity closely into our project advancement.We began by surveying the public knowledge of intestinal diseases and by interviewing three leading professionals (doctors and researcher) to get a vivid understanding of the severity and incidence of intestinal diseases.Q: We really hope to learn more about the classification of intestinal lesions from the perspective of medicine.A1: The first classification of lesions in digestive system is mainly based on dissection, including esophageal diseases, gastroduodenal diseases, small intestinal diseases, colon diseases, anorectal diseases, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases.Actually, each disease from different splanchna can make a sub-classification, like congenital disease or genetic disease, inflammatory diseases, tumor diseases, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, etc.Besides propagating our project, we managed to make respondents aware of the differences between tract diseases and intestinal diseases and the detailed treatments to these.intestinal tract diseases, better than merely intestinal diseases, the survey is needed to start from a boarder aspect and be narrowed to intestinal diseases.363 shares of answers are received, with 81.82% of which have no idea about iGEM.Meanwhile, we used posters and popular social media to introduce intestinal bowel disease and our work to the society.At the beginning of our project design, we thought of many possible treatments but during the process of reasoning we encountered some difficulties.Studies of intestinal disease are the core research of intestinal diseases nowadays.And we found that, unfortunately, public awareness intestinal diseases like IBD is insufficient.Thus, we decided to introduce IBD and its hazard to the public.And I antipate that intestinal diseases will be one of the most common diseases of digestive system in the 21st century in our country.is not clear and sometimes it is hard to determine the clinical effects.A2: Intestinal microecology is one of the factor causing inflammatory bowel disease.In the previous survey, our team found out that most Chinese know little about intestianl diseases and much more superficial about synthetic biology, many of whom having no idea what it is.Nearly all of them heard about Escherichia coli, while 49.18% knows Enterococcus faecalis.In the third part we started propagating our project and gain feedbacks.In conclusion, the result gives a proof of our initial conjecture that people are unconsciousness of the severeness of intestinal diseases, while they have been suffering from such things greatly.It was quite an experience to establish friendships with other IGEM teams.Owing to one of the purposes of IGEM that is to improve public awareness and knowledge of synthetic biology, as the first team founded in ShanghaiTech IGEM, we decided to establish an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI).I\u0092m greatly interested in studying inflammatory bowel disease from the perspective of intestinal microecology.There are so many different types of intestinal diseases and a major part of them consists of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal tumors.In this part of survey, we mixed intestinal diseases and tract diseases intentionally, and we are surprised to see that only 50.69% of participants can distinguish one from another.Among all the intestinal tract diseases, diarrhea, bellyache and stomachache are the most common ones.Personally, treating inflammatory bowel disease in the direction of intestinal microecology is very promising.Our IGEM project Gutrio and the idea to utilize synthetic biology to treat IBD were also introduced.We have introduced IBD to many communities, and wish more and more people to realize the severity of IBD.You can view our poster here.Q: We hope to understand the common methods of treating intestinal diseases, especially the inflammatory intestinal diseasesA: Now the methods of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases mainly include drug therapy (5-aminosalicylic acid, hormone, immunization drug, antibiotics, biologics), operative treatment, stool transplantation, stem cell transplantation and leukocyte elution adsorption treatment.Q: Now the cure rate of inflammatory intestinal diseases, especially chronic diseases and severe diseases, is still low.So what\u0092s the reason that made you choose to do the research in the field of intestinal diseases?A1: Diseases involved in gastroenterology are complicated.Personally, I\u0092m very interested in the field of intestinal tumor.Upon the development of social economy and the change of life styles, disease spectrum of digestive system also has been changing.Only 6.21% participants claim that 1~2 days are needed to cure the disease, while different people suffer from various intestinal tract diseases, with the time required to cure ranging from days to more than half a year.In addition, in the spirit of raising public interests, we established an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI) to advertise the beauty of synthetic biology to the community.He specializes in development and proliferation.When he got to know that we wanted to fight IBD, he pointed out to us that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), which is an important factor of his ongoing research, is a molecule that has the ability to promote regeneration of cells in the inflammatory regions.People believe that cancer and AIDS are the most severe diseases.However, 84.3% of participants have witnessed the suffering of intestinal tract diseases, with the cost of treatment covers a long range.64.19% of participants never came into contact with any propaganda or advertisement on intestinal diseases, and most (95.87%) of them feel it important to strengthen people\u0092s comprehension of intestinal diseases.In the second part we asked about gut flora.But this treatment is not widely used in our country.Crohn s disease(CD) may involve the whole digestive tract, any place from oral cavity to crissum, typically at the terminal of small intestine, which is ileum and ileocecus.We hope to know the disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases, from the perspective of a clinical doctor.And the obvious increase of the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease in our country in recent years proves this opinion.To have a better understanding of IBD and obtain the first view of the current situation of patients, we contacted two doctors and set up an interview with them.One is Ge Wensong, who comes from Shanghai Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.However, people know about detailed intestinal diseases, i.e.It turns out that this interview became the foundation of our project!In our project, we chose intestinal bowel disease as our object of study.There are mainly two types of inflammatory intestinal diseases: ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease.The target organ of ulcerative colitis(UC) is colorectal mucosa mostly, which means that inflammation is limited in mucous layer.During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients.Participants come from all walks of life, with only 36.36% of them being students.In the first part we investigated people\u0092s cognition in intestinal diseases.Operation can only deal with the problem that intestinal tract become narrow, get block or bleeding.We love this idea because it offers us a chance to get inspired by the society, allows us to better understand the meaning of our scientific research, and constantly reminds us how and why we should contribute back to the society.(But for the inflammatory bowel disease with the concurrency of infection of clostridium, it is the first-line therapy.)These factors can initiate or accelerate diseases, but they are not the determinants.For children, probiotics are the important method to maintain remission.If the patient is also resistant to glucocorticoid, we add imuran(AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine(6-MP).This survey consists of three major parts: intestinal diseases, gut flora and synthetic biology.If the patient is not sensitive to 5-ASA, we give them glucocorticoid.We realized intestinal diseases including IBD, are big threats to human health, yet without a cure and without sufficient public acquaintance.For example, the recurrence of the disease seriously affects people s health and lives and aggravates their economic conditions.Intestinal microecology is the research hotspot in recent years.In order to create a window for our team to communicate with the world, our team applied and managed a WeChat subscription account, trying to share the knowledge of synthetic biology and trending news about medical treatment responsibly.Treating inflammatory bowel disease completely through changing intestinal microecology still have a long way to go.However many pathogenesy of intestinal diseases is still vague.We delivered two introduction speeches about and synthetic biology and the IGEM on behalf of two ShanghaiTech IGEM teams respectively.For example, immune disease can cause the gastrointestinal involvement.A2: There are four types of lesions in digestive system : esophageal and gastric diseases, intestinal disease, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases.Expenses.Q: The leading edge of biological sciences is about the direction of the intestinal ecosystem.For example, the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease is closely related to the the process of industrialization in Europe and America.(Q= question, A= answear)Q: Human diseases include not only intestinal diseases, but also many other diseases which threaten human health seriously.During the communications with other teams , we received concerns on safety issues that we must deal with.Intestinal disease includes infectious intestinal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic bowel disease, autoimmune enteropathy, medical bowel disease and tumor enteropathy.Q: As an outstanding doctor, you must have participated in many major discussions of operations on patients and intractable cases.Intestinal tract diseases are among the least severe common diseases, as expected.A1: Treatment is mainly based on the drug therapy, because 5-ASA preparation has poor tolerance and glucocorticoid has several side effects (hypertension, hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis, etc.).( Of course, not every patient in our country will accept the fistulization at the end of ileum.Actually, inflammatory intestinal disease is a pathogenesis with genetic background, which involves environment, immunity and infection.This year, the IDPI invited students and teachers from Shanghai Concordia International High School and held an IGEM Open-Lab Day on Sep 3rd, 2016.In the spring of 2016, at National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, we interviewed Professor Pengfei Lu who was a researcher at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in the University of Manchester.We shared many details of the IGEM competition.Of course, some patients still have to undergo an operation because of the bowel obstruction, intestinal perforation, intestinal fistula, hemorrhoea, etc.As one of the visiting students commented, this tour was  so impressive and amazing .Maybe it is not because of a certain bacteria, instead, because of the change of the proportion of some bacteria or the change of metabolites.However, there is a big gap between the theoretical research and practice.The classrooms were not spacious but were big enough for passionate IGEMers.Because ShanghaitechChina_B is a newly founded team, we gave a presentation about our project and received many pieces of valuable advice.Heart attack ranked the third, followed by Parkinson\u0092s disease and Alzheimer\u0092s, then the pneumonia.We believed that the one day IDPI truly delivered the IGEM core value by arousing their curiosity to explore the secrets of nature.There are concerns about the drug for long term use existing serious adverse reactions.Medicine and operation are the most known.A few days after the visit, the teachers contacted us to consult us for building a biology lab.26.37% are conscious of fecal bacteria transplantation, along with the strict test it needs to run, which could be considered a disadvantage.Therefore, as a growth-promoting factor, EGF may bring about the risk of over-proliferation and even cancer.So what\u0092s your opinion about this current situation?A1: Intestinal micro ecosystem (intestinal flora) is a hot topic in recent years.Besides IGEM, we also discussed many frontier life science progress and appreciated their unique views.We then showed them our lab space and facilities, including cell sonicators, ultra-centrifuges and flow cytometry.Organizers and participants had to move from the hall to the teaching building to continue our seminar.So we upgraded our biosafety strategies by not only using two types of kill switches, but also using a  warship  (which limits bacteria spreading and still allows nutrient and chemical exchanging).As people know life-related diseases, i.e.The symptoms, diagnosis and related information about IBD were collected.A poster was designed by our team to show the public that IBD is threating our health, and we need basic knowledge about it.", "modeling": "Atkins\u0092 Physical chemistry, 7th Ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, 776)Consider a thin slab of cross-sectional area A that extends from x to x+l.Let the NO concentration at x be c at the time t. The amount (number of moles) of particles that enter the slab in the infinitesimal interval dt is JAdt, so the rate of increase in molar NO concentration inside the slab (which has volume Al) on account of the flux from the left is$$frac{partial c}{partial t}=frac{JAmathrm{d}t}{Almathrm{d}t}=frac{J}{l}$$There is also an outflow through the right-hand window.So, by using Fick s first law, we can write$$J-J =-Dfrac{partial c}{partial x}+Dfrac{partial c }{partial x}=-Dfrac{partial c}{partial x}+Dfrac{partial}{partial x}left[c+frac{partial c}{partial x}l \right]=Dlfrac{{partial}^{2}c}{partial {x}^{2}}$$The viscosity of water is 0.891 cP (or 8.91 \u00d7 10-4kg\u00b7m-1\u00b7-1), and the effective radius of NO approaches 0.36 nm in this case.With the constant D,which is called the diffusion coefficient, to be obtained, the formula above cannot be solved.The following picture shows the flux of particles down a concentration gradient.We turn to the discussion of time-dependent diffusion processes, where we are interested in the spreading and distributing of NO with time.The equation for the rate of change of the concentration of particles in an inhomogeneous region, diffusion equation, also called  Fick s second law of diffusion , which in this case relates the rate of change of NO concentration at a point to the spatial variation of the NO concentration at that point:$$frac{partial c}{partial t}=Dfrac{partial ^{2}c}{partial x^{2}}$$Figure 1.The flux through that window is J?, and the rate of change of NO concentration that results is$$frac{partial c}{partial t}=-frac{J Amathrm{d}t}{Almathrm{d}t}=-frac{J }{l}$$The net rate of change of NO concentration is therefore$$frac{partial c}{partial t}=frac{J-J }{l}$$Each flux is proportional to the NO concentration gradient at the window.Atkins\u0092 Physical chemistry, 7th Ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, 757)If we divide both sides of this equation by Avogadro\u0092s constant, thereby converting numbers into amounts (numbers of moles), then Fick\u0092s law becomes$$J=-Dfrac{mathrm{d}c}{mathrm{d}x}$$In this expression, D is the diffusion coefficient and dc/dx is the slope of the molar concentration.Finally we choose to do the calculations.For dilute non-electrolyte A, its diffusion coefficient in solvent B (also called the infinite-dilute diffusion coefficient) can be estimated by Wilke-Chang equation:$${D}_{AB}=7.4\times {10}^{-15}frac{{(Phi {M}_{B})}^{T}T}{mu {{V}_{A}}^{0.6}}mathrm{{m}^{2}/s}$$DAB \u0097 The inter-diffusion coefficient in an infinitely-dilute solution, m2/s.T \u0097 The temperature of the solution, K. In our case, it is 0.5.? \u0097 The parameter of association of solvent.Fick\u0092s first law states that the flux of matter (the number of particles passing through an imaginary window in a given interval divided by the area of the window and the duration of the interval) is proportional to the density gradient at that point.Fick\u0092s first law states that the flux of matter (the number of particles passing through an imaginary window in a given interval divided by the area of the window and the duration of the interval) is proportional to the density gradient at that point.However, it has simulated the characteristic of NO diffusion in the intestinal and provides us with some information on detection of NO concentration from the calculation point of view.The net flux in a region is the difference between the flux entering fromthe region of high concentration (on the left) and the flux leaving to the region of low concentration (on the right).To simplify the situation, we assume that the dissipative NO molecules gathered altogether as a dot at time 0 which is located on the lower part of the intestinal walls, and the walls consume all the NO molecules within its range.(Introduction of the association parameter into the formula is brought about by the fact that associated molecules behave like large-size molecules and diffuse at a lower rate; the degree of association varying with mixture composition and with molecule types.The six pictures demonstrate the NO concentration distribution with time (with the 1 s interval) around the wound caused by IBD.It can be estimated by Tyn-Calus Method: V=0.285V1.048, while Vc is the critical volume of a substance and measures 57.7 for NO.Figure 3.The flux of particles down a concentration gradient.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "", "keywords": "microfluidic hypotaurine antibiotics fundraising chemoreceptors unambiguous evaluating Instructions Pseudomonas explanation ", "track": "Therapeutics", "part_favorite": "", "part_normal": "BBa_K2152000\nBBa_K2152001\nBBa_K2152002\nBBa_K2152003\nBBa_K2152004\nBBa_K2152006", "theme": "Diagnostics", "hits": 0}, "highlight": {"modeling": [" <font color='#f35762'><b>solution</b></font>, m2/s.T \u0097 The temperature of the <font color='#f35762'><b>solution</b></font>, K.

must overcome to reach such an objective.", "design": "These specifications underly the portability aspect of our design, making our design the preferred form of radioprotection in terms of storage-space and weight.To ensure the durability of our patch during accidents such as punctures, tears, or the patch falling off the user, we researched materials used for transdermal delivery.In order to develop a sophisticated solution for the administration of our radioprotective peptide mBBI, a biotherapeutic transdermal patch was considered.The patch will house bacteria (B. subtilis) which are engineered to produce our radioprotective peptide mBBI, which will diffuse to the bloodstream through our patch system, giving radioprotection to the whole body.Our transdermal patch design allows us to maintain a stable concentration of mBBI in the blood.To determine if our design was cost effective, we also looked into large-scale manufacture and the level of difficulty to manufacture multiple patches.This led us to develop a user\u0092s manual for our patch and project design, where all information related to our applied design can be found.One pocket of the patch contains dry B. subtilis endospores.To extend the lifetime of the bacteria in the patch, the other three pockets include super-rich media, which can be added when the initial nutrients are depleted.The peptide is constantly produced inside the patch by Bacillus subtilis and continuously delivered into the body via diffusion.This allows our patch to be stored for long periods of time (as B. subtilis spores are resistant to desiccation and radiation) when not in use.Our patch design included four small pockets attached to one main large pocket.Current proposed solutions such as lead coating on spaceships, carbon nanotubes filled with boron, or generation of a radioprotective magnetic field using nuclear reactors are too expensive due to the additional cost in weight during launch and transport to deep space.In addition, the application procedure is noninvasive.To better integrate our project into existing infrastructure and for future space missions, we designed our delivery system for long-term use and portability.When pressure is applied, the pocket will release the spores into the main compartment, where the spores will be rehydrated and activated to their vegetative state.A typical mode of administration, such as intravenous injections or oral administration, would have been ineffective at maintaining a constant dose of peptide, as the peptide would be degraded by the body.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "This distribution of pressure prevents the material from rupturing due to accumulated forces along seams or corners.The fact that our patch is non-invasive and only present in the external part of the body promotes safety better than an implant.All materials used in the patch are chemically and biologically compatible, which decreases the risk of an immune response in the user.The backing layer of the patch is made up of a strong, flexible, and gas-permeable material.All team members, advisors, and mentors received credit for each course and training program listed, and supervisors were present in the lab at all times to oversee undergraduate work.The University of Calgary has a university-wide Biosafety Committee, whose guidelines for safe biological laboratory practices were adhered to throughout the project.The application was evaluated on multiple grounds such as feasibility, morality, and precautions of the testing of our transdermal patch on mice models.The testing of our transdermal patch was carried out based on the approved flowcharts below:  Since no member on the team had completed the Institutional Animal User Training Program (IAUTP) on mice handling and registered with the Institutional Research Information Services Soluion (IRISS), the mice handling work was completed by Dr. Jenne and members of his lab who had previous training and certification.All Principal Investigators, mentors, and undergraduate researchers were required to complete lab safety training and safety courses developed by the University of Calgary s Environment Health and Safety (EHS) services prior to working in the lab.Members of our iGEM team were present at all times during the testing of the transdermal patch in mice models but only as observers.This knocked out threonine synthase in our chassis, making it unlikely it would survive outside of conditions where theronine is not supplied.Environmental safety: \u00a0It\u0092s possible that our B. subtilis\u00a0 transformed with mBBI could outcompete native microbes and potentially disrupt existing ecologies; however, the integrated mBBI genetic construct would not make a significant difference in the bacteria\u0092s survivability outside the lab.We handled these cell lines at containment level 2 in accordance with the\u00a0Bloodborne Pathogens Standard and Biosafety Committee\u00a0guidelines.The circular design of the packet containing media and B. subtilis spores encourages equal distribution of liquid pressure around the circumference to prevent the patch from breaking open at the seams.The bacteria will not come into contact with the skin, which protects the user from the possibility of infection or immune responses.The adhesive chosen to affix the patch to the skin has high oxygen/gas permeability, causes low pain upon removal from sensitive skin, and promotes diffusivity of the drug.It is less invasive than an implant or injection, and delivers the therapeutic agent continuously, meaning the dosage is always above the threshold required for a therapeutic effect, and the user does not need to worry about taking their medication at the same time each day.Accidental breakage of the patch while attached to skin may cause infections if the area is not disinfected properly.To prevent the bacteria from escaping from the patch, there are several engineering controls in place, such as the protective physical barriers that prevent bacteria from diffusing out of the patch, including the backing layer and the selective membrane.Although our initial diffusion assays have shown that bacteria can diffuse through our semipermeable membrane, we have begun testing with other smaller filters including peptide dialysis membranes and 0.2 micron size filters.We have also had success with membranes used to filter-sterilize liquids.See pages 15 - 16 of the Device Applied Design Manual to tackle contamination issues.If we can determine a better membrane that prevents the diffusion of the bacteria, we can use a two layer semi permeable system where the first layer prevents the diffusion of the bacteria and a second layer which further filters BBI for diffusion.See pages 11 and 12 of the Device Applied Design Manual for disposal information.Public safety: Threonine auxotrophy was employed where integrated cassettes containing flanking regions of homology for the B. subtilis thrC\u00a0 gene were used.These mandatory safety training courses included courses on occupational health and safety, laboratory safety, hazard assessment, incident reporting and investigation, spill response, biosafety, bloodborne pathogens, and an updated versions of the WHMIS course.A patch gives the user the freedom to continue a course of medications even with an upset stomach, as the drug will not need to go through the digestive system.Contamination is an issue both on earth and in space, as the bacteria in the patch may be able to infect users of the patch or colonize foreign planets should they be released.This layer also prevents bacteria from escaping.The size controlling membrane is made up of polymers that prevent bacteria from flowing through the patch, but allow our peptide to pass.Given the nature of our project and safeguards we have implemented, none of our BioBricks confer unsafe risks to individuals nor the environment.We would engineer inducible kill switches that could eradicate the bacteria if need be.The packets are made of a flexible polyethylene material, which is advantageous for distributing external forces against the patch, such as accidental bumping or squishing.All required us to take a test following each course, which certified safe lab work under the EHS Guidelines.Additionally, integrating mBBI in various essential genes required for amino acid synthesis could provide more opportunities for auxotrophy, increasing the safety of using B. subtilis in the device.", "keywords": "astronauts Polyethylene Established Shigellosis Terephthalate calcitonin non-edible bioethical

Improved tools for the Brainbow toolbox.This year, we introduced this innovation of dynamic\u0096recombinase-system into our new project of Cyclebow, which can count cell-cycles in living cells and therefore shed light on many unsolved scientific problems, especially stem cell therapy.Before deciding on our project, we carried out a survey to know about people\u0092s opinions on stem cell therapy and whether our initial ideas would be meaningful.In summary, our project aims to develop an induced-spontaneous, dynamic labelling system, and as it focus on cell-cycles, we named it

of whether cells had successfully undergone one cell-cycle (which is what we usually mean for cell division).Brainbow is a system that randomly expresses fluorescent proteins in individual cells of mouse nervous system, basing on recombinase systems.From Brainbow, we got the message that it was possible to line up different parts in one DNA circuit and use recombinase to cut off one certain part, triggering the function of other parts.Last year, we develop a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up an internal clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently.Loulier, K., et al., Multiplex cell and lineage tracking with combinatorial labels.Cited from Loulier, K., et al., Multiplex cell and lineage tracking with combinatorial labels.This assured us that the majority of people had the same thought with us, and that our project would be meaningful if put into usage.Now we are in common ground with the public, we have the confidence to

stem cell in vivo>, the authors used a stochastic model where assumptions were made about HSC acting based on their unique intrinsic and micro-environmental signals and that these fates are independent[13].We developed a time sequence model that reflects the HSC number\u0092s change before reaching the upper limit K.x(t+dt) = x(t) + d * x(t) - v * x(t)x(t0) = 400x(t) <

denote X0 to be the initial state of the total HSC implanted into the recipient; Xt to be the number of HSC reserve in the time of t; d to be the dividing rate; v to be the emigration rate, a to be the death rate; K to be the upper limit of HSC cell reserve.100(7): p. 2665-2667.Catlin, S.N., et al., The replication rate of human hematopoietic stem cells in vivo.32(11): p. 1040-50.Abkowitz, J.L., et al., Evidence that the number of hematopoietic stem cells per animal is conserved in mammals.In order to simplify the model and minimize the number of regulatory molecules related to this model, we adopted the concept that we are able to control the effectiveness of the enzyme Vika and Vcre and then built up the hybrid-color changing process[15].Related articles suggest that human HSCs replicate on average once per 40 weeks, and that when the total number of HSC exceeds the upper limit K (K=11,000), only one offspring cell survive[16].We modified their equations to fit our situation and the equation as follow:X(t+dt) = X(t) + 1, withprobabilityX(t)?dividedtX(t+dt) = X(t) - 1, withprobabilityX(t)?deathdtX(t+dt) = X(t) - 1, withprobabilityX(t)?emigratedtX(t0) = 400X(t) < 11000\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We set up the starting point at 400 HSCs and run the stochastic function to simulate HSC cell growth till it reaches its maximum capacity, which is 11,000.Each plasmid that contains a single Cyclebow system is relatively independent, and the enzyme expressed by one plasmid are less likely to diffuse into other parts of the cell and affect the effectiveness of the enzyme.Here we simulate the Cyclebow Hybrid-Color Model extended from the pure color model with RGB color combination.78(6): p. 1122-34.Shepherd, B.E., et al., Estimating human hematopoietic stem cell kinetics using granulocyte telomere lengths.Once differentiate, the cell will exhaust in a finite period of time.Parameters of the effectiveness of each enzyme is trained and the most distinguishable one is selected.Based on these assumptions, we established the color combination model which is able to extend the colors to up to 7 generations, in which each color can be easily distinguished by human eyes.One previous paper suggests us to use the optimal parameter combinations, where d = 1/40 (divide once per 40 weeks[17]), v = 0.71d, a = 0.14d, X0 = 400, K=11,000[18].",

the color distinguishment.Moreover, in our design, the COUNTER CIRCUIT should consist VIKA UNIT and VCRE UNIT, and our REPORTER UNIT should contain red, green and blue.We suspended this design for the reason that VCRE UNIT and GFP UNIT were not available.In our initial design, we use pure color for distinguishing cell-cycles (e.g., red of mCherry, green of GFP).Therefore, instead of pure colors, cells that undergo different numbers of cell-cycles will present somewhat a continuous spectrum of which color ranges from the first UNIT\u0092s color to the last UNIT\u0092s color.Figure 1: Concept of the outcome of Hybrid-color cyclebowCited from Kretzschmar, K., & Watt, F.

opportunities for good health, so that older people can take an active part in society and enjoy an independent and high quality life\u0094.", "design": "Considering this information and as a way to prevent the harmful effects of ageing, we propose a novel gene therapy based on the regulated expression of SOD on respiratory cells.The use of lentivirus as the vector of the gene therapy give the opportunity to integrate large amounts of cDNA (~ 10 Kb) into the host genome, the virus can be used in animal models since it avoids the immune response and its rate of transfection is very high which is relevant since many important cell types are highly resistant to transfection.This strategy known as Transient tripartite transfection requires three different plasmids:  Transfer plasmid: contains the genetic material of the genetic therapy, in this case Superoxide dismutase (SOD) + GFP, which it would be integrated into the host genome through the long terminal repeats (LTRs)  Packaging plasmid: Contains the HIV-1 core proteins.The only plasmid to be inserted in the host genome it would be the one containing LTRs: the transfer plasmid that contains the Superoxide dismutase (SOD) + GFP.This would make our gene therapy safer for the body, and more controlled.He told us that he thought that the gene therapy was a good idea, rapid and interesting.There has been attempts of making an oral supplement with pure SOD enzyme to act as an ageing therapy, but it s been found that the SOD protein molecule is easily deactivated by harsh acids and enzymes contained in the digestive tract.It is possible that we could add more nfkb binding sites to the existing promotor in the registry made by a previous 14_ATOMS-Turkiye team such that high levels of nfkb are required to release SOD3.Besides, an advantage of this approach is the application of the therapy directly in the lung cells which are very exposed to oxidizing agents.We also discussed that research indicates that oxidative stress is actually good for the body, and that we neede to conside this in our design.Therefore, it was even more important that we have incorporated safety into the design of each idea.Whilst ageing is a universal process, there is complexity below the surface.This therapy will use an inhaler to introduce SOD enzyme in the organism since SOD enzyme cannot be administrated efficiently as an oral supplement or intravenously due to reported problems with immune response, proteases, etc.One example of these agents is the enzyme Superoxide dismutase (SOD).After designing our SOD3 system, we wanted to find out what the experts in the ageing field think of our ideasWe talked to William Bains, who is an ageing researcher and knows a lot about emerging therapies within the field.Self-inactivating (SIN) Lentivirus is the name of the approach use for the Transfer plasmid which gives more security and a better transfection.The mechanism of SOD is based on the partitioning (dismutation) of the superoxide into an oxygen (O2) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) molecule.Even though animal models suggest that intervening with ageing has had a positive impact on the healthy lifespan of the animals, we are still not able to guarantee the same effects on humans.SIN plasmids also harbour a large deletion in the U3 region of the 3\u0092LTR which results in the virus being unable to reconstitute its promoter.The proposed free radical theory of ageing establishes that the progression of ageing is because the accumulation of damage caused by these radicals, over a period of time.The generation of free radicals and their involvement in ageing have been a concern in the past years.Determines the specificity of the virus: what types of cells can be infected by the virus, etc.One example is the free radical called superoxide (O2-), which is a by-product of the respiratory cycle in every aerobic organism.These agents are atoms or molecules with an unpaired electron in the outer shell, which makes most of them highly reactive towards several relevant biomolecules.The antioxidants are reducing agents capable of limiting this damage through the passivation of important biomolecules.", "human_practice": "With that being said, we also learned that most all of these challenges and long term implications can be worked through with enough consideration, making us comfortable with the notion that our ageing therapies could do a lot of good if it were implemented in the real world.We really understand that as ageing is a global problem, we want to incorporate as many perspectives, issues, barriers towards our project as we can in order to fully evaluate the benefits to our therapies.From pension schemes to the socio-economic demographic, and that we needed to consider these factors through our project.Initially, we spoke to our main project inspiration, Aubrey de Grey (the full skype video can be seen here ).Once we listened, and engaged in a 2-way conversation, we then understood that our project can impact nearly everything.The influence of human practices has formed an integral part of our project and has greatly changed not only the design of our therapies, but the team\u0092s perception and understanding of the problem.We understood that a lot of the general public do not see ageing as a disease, or yet even as a problem so we wanted to educate them through our interactive workshops.Outreach inspired us to then reach out to as many different people as we could to broaden our network to the wider community and making our project integrated into today\u0092s society.As a result of talking to Aubrey, we designed further characterisation tests for our lycopene BioBrick, where we have stressed our cells through different inducers of oxidative stress.Superoxide dismutase 3: The evolution of a novel therapy  We then fed this back into our interactions with the experts with William Bains who said that this was a good idea and can form an interesting and rapid approach.As a result of this interaction, we decided to add the nfkb promotor to our SOD3 biobrick to increase safety of our device.However, we did not expect that we would learn so much from these outreach sessions and that it would shape the execution of our project as much as it did.Through talking and interacting with the public, we were able to not only educate them about synthetic biology innovations, but to also learn about what our end users are afraid of with our therapies.We truly believe that every person we have interacted with has resulted in either changing the way the team thinks about our project, inspired the formation of a new BioBrick or improve the design of our ideas.", "modeling": "We have also shown that background levels of production and degradation have a dramatic effect on the amount of oscillation.2C shows the same scan as above but with no background production or degradation present in the model.Figure 2.Additionally, we included in our model production and degradation of arabinose and GRE.It is possible that with a further refinement indefinite oscillations will occur.We found that having background levels of production and degradation for both D-Arabinose and Gre/Cl was necessary for oscillation.For a more detailed description of how xylitol fits into our project, please visit our entrepreneurship page.In the pathway, D-arabinose activates the pBAD/AraC promoter causing production of GRE and cl, these inhibit the T7/cl promoter under which are genes for the production of arabinose (Fig.Using certain combinations of the parameters, we were able to develop a model which shows some oscillatory behaviour.The activation step representing the activation of pBAD/AraC, the repression step encompasses the GRE/cl inhibiting T7/cl promoter and this effect of the production of arabinose through the genes under the promoter.Without the background production and degradation the model quickly reached a steady state with little to no oscillations.Why we chose to develop a model of the Xylitol pathway and overview of the modelWe chose to model the Xylitol pathway as it is impossible to intuit the combination of parameters that will cause oscillation, but this can be done with modelling.", "notebook": "The other team members were working on developing different parts of the project, Hana was working on the business plan, Abbie and Amandeep attended a meeting with our supervisor where we discussed some of our biobricks (Lycopene), and created an action plan for the

advisor, to get some safety training which will equipt us with the knowledge to be able to handle an emergency whilst using the labs at UCL.We also got insights to what life is like for the team members post iGEM - how iGEM has affected their lives after the competition, which was very inspiring and interesting to know of.Some of the team members attended a meeting with our supervisors where we were able to start to organise our experiments and our plan for the coming month.Michelle, Abbie and Amandeep were presenting at the synthetic biology showcase, where we got to share our project with experts in the field and also ask about their opinions on our project.The team members then met up to discuss what we need todo for today, some team members were interested in starting labs (for our project) today, whilst other team members worked on developing the lesson plans for the outreach activities we have planned next week!All team members met to decide on the aspects within our project that we want to explore in detail (post discussion from the meeting on Friday with Vitor).We also had a meeting with the UCL staff members who are related to sutton trust year 12 summer school - we will be collaborating with them!All team members and post doctoral supervisors were then present to narrow down to one project idea from all the wonderful ideas we had come up with in the previous brainstorming sessions.After meeting with the team the day before, this was the day that the team members and the post doctoral supervisors met up to map out some experimental plans that would develop from the research we had done before.The other team members were in a meeting with our supervisors, where we had a discussion about the biobricks that still needed to be ordered, .Abbie and Amandeep is also working on developing the design of the wiki (building the design of the website with James).Amandeep and Dale also met with Shubo who was able to help us to plan the yeast

able to receive a really useful and interesting lecture about the key synthetic biology and molecular biology knowledge needed in order to take part in iGEM (or to understand lab work at least!).Abbie is now working on the lycopene experiment and design whilst Amandeep is creating some content for our wiki page.We also discussed ideas related to funding and sponsorship  Discussed our idea in depth and started to work as a team on the different biobricks we wanted to order.We then had a chance to have some further discussions about the project as a team and came to the conclusion that we needed to narrow our ideas down more.Monday, 6th June, 6.30pm - Meeting with Paris Bettencourt 2014  All team members were present at a meeting with a team member of the 2014 Paris Bettencourt iGEM team.Most team members were present to brainstorm some more ideas we had come up with, to the rest of the team with some pizza added!Other team members are working on creating the resources for the outreach programmes that we have planned for the near future!In the evening, we were given a wiki training session from Lewis Moffat, a member of UCL s 2014 team.Amandeep wa also working on giving Neythan feedback on the app he has developed - I was able to do a trial run through.After the talk, Abbie, Amandeep and Kamil were able to start to work on meeting some deadlines (such as the proposal for the CRISPR grant and safety forms).See what the UCL iGEM team have been doing all summer.Amandeep and Michelle also worked on the poster presentation (for the meet up).After the webinar, team members were able to raise any issues they were having with any idea developments to the post doctoral supervisors.Some of the team members met to attend a skype meeting with the Paris team at 11am.We got given a presentation about Imperials iGEM project and Imperial also shared some of their stories of the process, what went well, what didn\u0092t go well and what could\u0092ve been better (hence, what we can think about doing!).Abbie, Amandeep and Michelle went to London City hall to see David Kurten (A member of the London assembly).Amandeep is working on the SOD proposal, doing extra research and

Friday 29th July), where we discussed ways to make the session more interactive and relevant to the theme of the summer school which is London.We also presented our project this day to the other teams.We all had a chance to talk to Maximina after the talk who answered some of our questions about how we could incorporate this interesting research with our project.As well as this, we were also focused on finishing the presentation and the poster for the synthetic biology showcase the next day.The team members also had a skype meeting with Experiment.Thursday 23rd June (5pm)- UCL iGEM meets Westminster iGEM  Most team members were able to meet the Westminster iGEM team where we spoke about our projects and possible collaborations between Westminster and UCL iGEM teams.He has also been working on some of the experimental plan.One really useful part of the software we really liked was the lab notebook - where we are able to also convert the notebook to html (useful tool for putting the notes onto our wiki page).Amandeep and Abbie attended the UK iGEM team meet up.Kuba, , Dale, Michelle, Kamil and Amandeep were attending a meeting with New England Biologics about how they can sponsor us and provide us with some tools in the labs.Amandeep prepared the presentation for the UK iGEM meet up which is tomorrow.Amandeep and Abbie conducted a workshop with year 12 students who are taking part in the Sutton Trust summer school.Abbie ans Kuba were also in the lab today.Amandeep and Abbie attended a meeting with Maximina from UCL, where we were able to get a different perspective on our project.As ageing has a lot of ethical issues associated with it, we wanted to make sure we start to interact with the public and the local community about how synthetic biology can be used for people to live healthier lives for longer.After the lecture, we were able to pitch our ideas to Dr Vitor who raised some key issues with some of our ideas and things that we didn\u0092t think about before.Amandeep is working on arranging more events and sessions (human practices)  Some people were in the labs, whilst others were working on the poster and the presentation for the synbio showcase.Because we were so motivated and excited by the talk, we started to actively start to brainstorm, adding to our never ending list of possible ideas (note: weird and wacky ideas still welcome).Amandeep is finding an oxidative stress induced promotor for the SOD system we are hoping to build, updating wiki and devising a plan for our human practices.Most team members decided to meet to do some further research as a team on possible areas of ageing that we can focus on.Amandeep started making the infographic, which was posted onto social media to introduce our project to the wider community.We are also preparing our questions for the meeting with Maximina tomorrow.Other team members focused on developing the documentation of each biobrick and also updating our wiki page and contacting people!All team members had a chance to ask questions to Imperial about their experiences, which will help with our organisation as a team throughout this project!Amandeep is learning CSS and javascript - developing the design of the wiki.We are also looking into preparing for the interview later as well as looking into other mini projects we can take on.We wanted to start to collaborate with the igem teams (uptown funk music video).The team members also started to think about DNA and what parts/biobricks would need to be ordered.We had a skype meeting with Aubrey de Grey, which provided us with a huge insight to ageing research and also tips on our project.Amandeep was designing the Logo for the T-shirts and phoning companies to get a quote for some t-shirts.Friday 3rd June, 6.30pm - Meeting with UCL iGEM 2015  All team members were able to gain huge inspiration and insight to iGEM by meeting the 2015 iGEM team.We are also looking more into creating some visuals for the synbio showcase.We received downstream transfer of knowledge and lots of tips on how to get started (the do\u0092s and dont\u0092s of iGEM) and inspired whilst brainstorming.Further to this, we found out that we can be featured in an article (Which we were able to get published on the UCL outreach website)!She also spoke to RICE iGEM team about collaborating with their humans of synbio project and has been interviewed to feature.Michelle started making the introduction of team members video for our youtube video.We then went to the pub where we had a laid back social session with light brainstorming.We also had a meeting social with Imperial 2016 team!!!Michelle is working on the poster for Westminster.We were able to all pitch our ideas to the post doctoral supervisors who helped with assessing the feasibility of certain ideas and helped come up with new and interesting ideas.Thursday 30th June - Some team members attended the ISMB Symposium  Some team members were able to get a huge insight to what researchers around the world are working on when it comes to senescence.All team members met up to start to brainstorm ideas.We also had a final discussion about project ideas before we meet for PROJECT HACK day the following morning.We discussed our project with them and came up with some great activities with the students.We attained knowledge on the biobrick assembly, the different ways to clone and also primer design.Most team members shared some exciting research, ideas and knowledge that they had researched the night before.Abbie was looking up the experimental protocol for Lycopene.Amandeep is working on developing the wiki (making graphics, and the content) also hoping to start the yeast experiment this week.We were able to give them some

/ BL21, etc.)", "result": "Due to the greater oxidative stress, the wild type cells are unable to grow in these conditions and show a very low optical density at 485 nm, which indicates a lack of lycopene production.The optical density at 485 nm is lower for higher oxidative stress conditions with the wild type cells, which is due to their respective cell densities.E. coli cells transformed with this construct were compared with the wild type TOP10 E. coli (W/T) monitoring growth and division via optical density (OD) at 600 nm, at specific time points \u0096 3 hours and 16 hours following withdrawal of oxygen.After establishing that the mNARK-Lycopene device improves cells growth compared to wild type E. coli, the growth of the Lycopene cells was measured against lycopene expression.During the experiment with 2 mM copper (II) sulphate; the wild type E. coli cells continue to grow, since it did not produce an environment where there was substantial oxidative stress.It is clear that, for both the mNARK-Lycopene device and wild type E. coli cells, lycopene expression increases with cell density, as more lycopene is being produced as a result of there being a larger number of lycopene producing cells.The plot indicates that the mNARK-Lycopene device expresses lycopene at a higher rate than the wild type cells.At the 100 \u00b5M concentration, the wild type cells flat lined, remaining at an optical density of 0.25, while the lycopene cell concentration increased substantially from an optical density of 0.07 to 0.45 after four hours of growth.mNARK-Lycopene cells had a higher OD compared to the wild type cells.Both of these experiments, again, indicate that, in the presence of simulate oxidative stress conditions, the mNARK-Lycopene promotes E. coli growth substantially better then the control.mNARK lycopene enables ecoli growth under Hypoxia conditions  Hypoxia is a condition in which cells are deprived of oxygen due to low concentration of oxygen in the extracellular milieu.After carrying out the positive control, the mNARK-Lycopene cells were tested under conditions of simulated oxidative stress, with the LB media containing 2 mM copper (II) chloride.In this experiment, the performance of the Lycopene cells is more pronounced, clearly showing that the mNARK-Lycopene devlice mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells from dying.In comparison, the mNARK-Lycopene cells achieved a final optical density of 0.33 from a low of 0.05.Furthermore, with regards to W/T cells, a depletion in the oxygen concentration caused a drop in cell growth and division, as reflected in decreased OD measurements.At 50 \u00b5M, the optical density of the wild type cells decreases to an OD of 0.05 from the initial reading of 0.17.The gradient of the two wild type cell graphs are similar, which is expected, as neither have an oxidative stress promoter.The lycopene cells display greater growth in the harsher 100 ?M conditions compared with 50 ?M.From an initial cell density of 0.08, the wild type cells reach a maximum cell density of 0.34.Therefore, it can be concluded that the mNARK-Lycopene mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells from dying.The mNARK-Lycopene cells substantially outperformed the wild type cells, reaching a final OD600 of around 0.45 and, potentially, still rising, while the growth of the wild type cells had clearly levelled off over the equivalent time period and had began to die, reaching a final OD600 of around 0.12.Superoxide Dismutase 3 Biobrick: GFP titration experiment  This data shows that as we increase the volume of lentivirus added to our lentivirus, there is an increase in the number of positive cells that have taken up the GFP construct.The mNARK-Lycopene device is induced by oxidative stress and produces lycopene as means to  mop up  the oxidative stress in the environment, in the form of a probiotic.Initially, the growth of mNARK-Lycopene was compared with the growth of wild type E. coli.However, the mNARK-Lycopene cells continue to grow and produce lycopene in these conditions.An existing BioBrick in the iGEM registry (BBa_K239001), designed to detect misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or shear stress has been further characterised to demonstrate the BioBrick functions as a pH inverter.GOLD MEDAL: irrE BioBrick enables E. coli to persist in medical lubricant  Diagram to show different growth of wild type E.coli vs. IrrE E.coli in 40% Lubricant 60% LB using Absorbance at 600nm  From the data shown in the graph above it clearly shown that the E.Coli transformed with IrrE grows better in the 40%Lubricant/60%LB solution in direct comparison with the Wild type E.Coli, which hardly grew at all.Wild type E. coli does not achieve such a cell density and, by extension, lycopene expression.Wild type cells grew better under less oxidative stress (50 ?M SNP), compared to 100 ?M SNP.From the above data, we can deduce that our biobrick will produce more lycopene when there is more oxidative stress in older people there creating a regulatory feedback system.Therefore allowing cells to grow to a greater optical density, and, as mentioned above, greater cell density corresponds with greater lycopene production.GOLD MEDAL: Spy promoter BioBrick functions as pH switch The deterioration of oral health in the elderly is accompanied by an increased prevalence of caries and periodontal disease, which are risk factors for some systemic diseases and nutrition problems (1).In our project, we designed a biosynthetic device to serve as an alternative in preventative dental care for the elderly.We performed an additional assay expressing lycopene under the mNARK promoter, to test if the cells could survive longer under hypoxia-induced stress.Characterisation was achieved by comparing the performance of the BioBrick against wild type E. coli.In summary, out analysis has shows that our mNARK-Lycopene device protects the cells from oxidative stress and, from this, we can assume that this effect will continue once our lycopene probiotic is consumed by and aging person.The results indicate that the mNARK-Lycopene device boots E. coli growth.Under various stresses, the mNARK-Lycopene device promotes E. coli growth.Additionally, the gradient of the graph represents the rate at which cells express lycopene.As shown in the plot, the mNARK-Lycopene device reached a higher cell density of 0.57, which corresponds to an OD485 of 0.68.Compared to the control, as pH increases from 3.97 to 6.78, GFP expression gradually increases for E. coliwith BBa_K239009.However, growth and division of mNARK-Lyco-containing cells was maintained in oxygen-deficient environment during the 16-hour time test period.First, the cells were grown in LB media with 2 mM copper (II) sulphate.Beyond this maximum, there is a sharp decline in GFP expression as the starting LB broth increases in alkalinity, falling to 7,394 at pH 7,394.After this, the general trend is one of increasing fluorescence as pH increases, but the increase is more gradual.From this experiment, we have established that BBa_K239009 (Spy Promoter) previously used to characterise protein misfolding can be used as a pH-sensitive promoter, as well.Cells exposed to hypoxia were also compared with the cells that were grown with oxygen.Gil-Montoya JA, de Mello ALF, Barrios R, Gonzalez-Moles MA, Bravo M. Oral health in the elderly patient and its impact on general well-being: a nonsystematic review.Additionally, it has been proved that the cells will be able to survive and multiply in the gut and colonise it.Thus overall this experiment has allowed us to show that IrrE increases the growth of the E. Coli in the Superdrug Lubricant containing: purified water, glycerine, Carbopol 940, Triethanolamine and Sodium Butyl Paraben.This data thus suggests that with the IrrE the E.Coli is better adapted to living in, which would allow further studies being conducted on the maximum concentration of Lubricant it can be grown in.Cellular stress leads to deregulation of intracellular processes, as both the structure and function of macromolecules are compromised.The gradient of 50 ?M mNARK-Lycopene at 0.8435 is less than that of the 100 ?M sample, which is 1.0864.Wild type E. coli grew to a final optical density of 0.35 after three hours, from an initial OD of 0.15.For further conceptualisation and experimentation it should be taken into consideration that within a commercialisable product the bacteria will not be under ideal growth conditions and the nutrients will be a limiting factor, especially when considering that the lubricant concentration will have to be a lot higher than in this experiment.2003 Sep 9;42(35):10372\u009684.1999 Sep;65(9):3880\u00967.This results in a greater optical density being achieved and, by extension, greater lycopene production.2012 Nov 1;56(11):5804\u009610.Draper LA, Cotter PD, Hill C, Ross RP.This indicates that our mNARK device increases lycopene expression under higher oxidative stress.The inability of cells to effectively manage cellular stress over time has been linked to cellular ageing and age-related diseases (Haigis and Yankner, 2010; Polj\u009aak and Milisav, 2012).We decided to target pH and an indicator of deteriorating oral health and use it as an system to regulate the relate of antimicrobial peptide known as mutacin III, is effective against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria implicated in dental caries, e.g.1984 Apr;44(1):141\u00964.Cotter PD, Hill C, Ross RP.Structure and dynamics of the lantibiotic mutacin 1140.", "safety": "According to the proposal, we plan to test whether vitellogenin can reduce oxidative stress in human cells using the recombinant yeast cells P.pastoris.Hence, why we also have discussed how we can incorporate safety into the design of our vitellogenin device.Once B.tabaci has taken up the RNAi-mixed food, its vitellogenin level will be lowered and oxidative stress will increase, which becomes more susceptible to death.As our therapies will be integrating into the human body, safety forms a major part of our project.Therefore we have greatly incorporated the safety of our gene therapy into our design of the biobricks.As stated in the vitellogenin proposal, pest control can be achieved via feeding the silverleaf whitefly B.tabaci using the species-specific RNAi-mixed food.The recombinant P.pastoris cells have been studied previously, does P. pastoris vitellogenin behave in the same way as human cell?However, there has not been any research published explaining the side effect of the up-regulation of vitellogenin in human.UCL Biosynthage Vitellogenin project has two aspects: the application of RNAi in pest control and anti-anging in human.As the pest is involved in virus transmission, does the change in vitellogenin gene alter the virus?The next measure is the use of a chimeric LTR to reduce dependence on the structural gene tat.This would mean that the final SOD3 device will only respond to high levels of oxidative stress.This safety lock would be based on the use of a drug capable as positive feedback.If it works then potential gene therapy can be conducted to transfer the recombinant cell into human.The next step of research is to increase the expression of vitellogenin human cells to test the level of oxidative stress.We believe that this approach would be a significant improvement as we can control the release of our SOD3 enzyme only to be released when needed.These questions need to be answered in the future research to be conducted.As explained on our human practices, we also integrated the idea of adding an nfkb promotor which would be engineered to have more binding sites.Due to the time limit and the amount of grant sponsored, we have not been able to conduct this part of research.", "keywords":

\u0091none\u0092 growth inhibition about prisoner A , but the results of the modeling did not match with the wet lab results showing leaked expression of CmR.We calculated the OD of after 480 minutes by using the following equations (3), (5) and (10).From this result, we can conclude that we have made the difference in growth small for all the 4 types of growth inhibition between Prisoner A and B.Next we obtained the optimal concentration of Cm to make the payoff matrix symmetrical when the metabolic burden of producing proteins is the same, but the concentration of C4HSL and 3OC12HSL is different.Compared to Fig.4-1-4-1., although the difference in growth is smaller, the difference of \u0093low\u0094 and \u0093none\u0094 is above 10 %.Even though large unintended difference in growth occurs between Prisoner A and B, suitable concentrations of Cm in each prisoner can minimize such difference in growth.We found the optimal Cm concentration for when the degree of metabolic burden is different between Prisoner A and B.We obtained the optimal concentration of Cm to make the payoff matrix symmetrical when the concentration of C4HSL and 3OC12HSL is the same, but the metabolic burden of producing proteins is different.The OD of the 4 types of growth inhibition for Prisoner A and B is shown in Fig.4-1-4-1Here, the maximum difference in growth is when the growth inhibition is high, and it is over 30 %.The graph of comparision is shown at Fig.4-1-3-1.Since the results of the modeling did not match with the wet lab, assuming that there was a leakage in the promoter of the CmR, we calculated the OD considering the leakage of the promoter of the CmR, in which the results successfully matched with the wet lab.Given the result from the wet lab that the OD of \u0094none\u0094 and \u0093low\u0094 hardly differs from the modeling, on the other hand, \u0093middle\u0094 and \u0093high\u0094 had huge difference, we assumed that the promoter is activated and CmR is produced even in the absence of AHL.Therefore, we used the equations (3) and (5) instead of (12) and (13).The results are shown in Fig.4-1-4-4.When the concentration of Cm of Prisoner B is 72, the difference in growths of all 4 types of growth inhibition was within 10%.From the results of 4.3 and 4.4, in order to make the payoff matrix symmetrical, adjusting the concentration of Cm is an effective solution.In terms of design principle, the modeling thus greatly contributes to obtain an improved part required for the project.Although we planned to replicate a symmetrical payoff matrix, one replicated in our wet lab experiment was asymmetrical, in which the growth inhibition differs between Prisoner A and B.The model is shown at the following equation (1).We then set specific parameters to draw the equations (2) ~ (5) for modeling for the 4 type of Punishment in the payoff matrix about prisoner A by developing the equation (1).We constructed the equation (2) ~ (5) for modeling for the 4 type of Punishment in the payoff matrix about prisoner A by developing the equation (1).The equation (2) and (4) are the models that the term for metabolic burden is added to (1).E shows the absolute value of the difference in growth between the ODs of A and B, per growth inhibition.Next, we fixed the concentration of Cm for Prisoner A, and by changing the concentration of Cm for Prisoner B, processed the difference in growth of all the 4 types of growth inhibition to around 10%.Therefore, we revised the following equations (10) to the following (14).We also added the equation (15), which represents the production of CmR due to the leakage of the promotor, in the absence of AHL.We compared the result of modeling (Fig.4-1-3-2A) and wet lab(Fig.4-1-3-2B).Instead, when the Cm concentration of Prisoner B is 69 \u00b5g/mL, the difference in growth of \u0093high\u0094 was reduced to less than 1/3 compared to before adjusting the Cm concentration, and was below 10 %.The graph of comparision is shown at Fig.4-1-3-1.The equation (13) and (14) are the model for the ODs of each \u0091middle\u0092 and \u0091none\u0092 growth inhibition about prisoner A.The equation (11) is the model for production of 3OCHSL in prisoner B coli.The results of replicating the payoff matrix which the ODs of 4 type of growth inhibition after 8 hours by using these equation are shown in Fig.4-1-2-1 and Fig.4-1-2-2.We also constructed the equation (6) ~ (9) for modeling for the 4 type of Punishment in the payoff matrix about prisoner B in the same way as prisoner A.If the effect of CmR is above the toxicity of Cm, is set to 0 at the equation (4) and (5).The graph of comparision is shown at Fig.4-1-3-4.From the results, tagging CmR with ssrA is a more effective solution to the leaky promoter producing CmR, compared to increasing the concentration of Cm.In order to reflect the effect of the ssrA tag, we customized each of the equations (14) and (15) to the equations (16) and (17).We compared the result of modeling and wet lab.The reason why the growth inhibition differed between Prisoner A and Prisoner B can be two types of difference.We here focused on the OD of the \u0091middle\u0092 and \u0091none\u0092 growth inhibition about prisoner A for modeling.One is that the degree of the metabolic burden is different between producing rhlI and lasI, and the other is that the concentration of AHL given to the E. coli is different.For future wet experiments, we need to confirm, by modeling, whether we can tune the asymmetry of not.Therefore, we fixed the concentration of Cm of Prisoner A, and by changing the concentration of Cm for Prisoner B, adjusted the concentration of Cm so that the difference in growth of all the 4 types of growth inhibition was processed to be within 10%.Fig.4-1-2-1 is the matrix of prisoner A. fig.4-1-2-2 is the matrix of prisoner B.Although our initial modeling successfully replicate the payoff matrix, Our wet lab found an unexpected leakage in the promoter.The results of the calculation were similar to the results of the wet lab.To overcome the leakage, we tried modeling two different solutions to see which one is more efficient.In contrast to the above models with 100 microg/mL Cm, we calculated the OD, setting the concentration of Cm to 150 microg/mL.The equation (2) and (3) are the models that the term for the effect of CmR is excepted from (1).We thus decided that there was no need to run any experiments in the wet lab, since the obtained results were not positive.As the other solution, we tagged CmR with ssrA, which is a degradation tag.Our project requires the improvement of the previously existing part for Chloramphenicol resistance (CmR) coding sequence to decrease unintended antibiotic effect by leaky expression, because we had to diminish such effect for implementation of a payoff matrix in Prisoners\u0092 Dilemma.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "May cause

Lactobacillus johnsonii for increased fructose metabolism.", "design": "Our primary goal being an increase in the utilization of fructose in the Lactobacillus\u0092 metabolism, weplanned to disable key enzymes in the metabolic pathway of glucose, thus forcing the bacterium toTo that end, we aimed to use CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), being the most flexible and affordable tool for genomicmodification, as a means to achieve a knockout.On the other hand, fructose metabolism should be enhanced by upregulation of endogenous enzymes: Fructose enters the cell as monosaccharide or, in conjunction with glucose, as sucrose.So the idea was to introduce a ketohexokinase into yeast leading to the production and accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in fructose containing environment.Besides, the phosphofructokinase was chosen for elevated fructose turnover: This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphat preventing fructose-6-phosphate accumulation after increased uptake.Carbohydrates are taken up into the cell via transporters of the ABC-superfamily, getting phosphorylated in this process, but for glucose no specific transporter was annotated.Many coulometric assays with the possibility of quantitative measurement are available for sugars, many of which having the problem of distinguishing between different kinds of sugars, especially between Glucose and Fructose due to chemical similarity.Glucose and fructose metabolism in wild type L. johnsonii (FIGURE 1) differs from our engineered bacterium in following points: Schematic illustration of sugar metabolism in L. johnsonii.To downregulate the glucose metabolism, a gene knockout via CRISPR/Cas9 system was planned.The ketohexokinase designed for this project is based on the ketohexokinase of Rattus norvegicus, originally used for the experiments in Donaldson\u0092s publication.Metabolic pathway engineering was used to modify Lactobacillus johnsonii for increased fructose metabolism.L. johnsonii\u0092s genome was documented and analyzed in course of the Human Microbiome Project in 2009.Due to a lack of opportunityto test these constructs in Lactobacillus Johnsonii, they will be tested in different model organisms.To prove the effectiveness of our transformed lactobacilli, we had to come up with a quantitative fructose assay.Therefore, the two main enzymes for glucose-6-phosphate metabolism were targeted: Glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase is part of glycolysis, converting glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and reverse, as well as glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase which converts glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone, being the starting point for the pentose phosphate pathway.Following the indole reaction, the quantitative measurement of the test was done photometrically at 470nm with a standard spectrophotometer.Using a Cas9 endogenous to another strain of L.Johnsonii, our plan was to replace our target genes with a reporter construct of our own design.By taking advantage of the polycistronic nature of transcription in prokaryotes, it is possible toconstruct a template for homologous recombination that is only transcribed once successfully copiedinto the genome.Yeast cannot metabolize fructose-1-phosphate causing it to be toxic for the cells and inhibiting its growth.Enhancing this enzyme\u0092s activity should result in higher ATP production via glycolysis using mainly fructose and sucrose as substrates.Enhancement of fructose and sucrose metabolism should be achieved by introducing the three endogenous proteins via the lactobacillus shuttle vector pNZ124Tue.Theoretical scheme of modified sugar metabolism of L. johnsonii.In human, hereditary fructose intolerance is caused by accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate.Those modifications aim to increase fructose uptake, while reducing glucose consumption, because both carbohydrates display the main energy sources of L. johnsonii ATCC33200.This strategy should enable a quick and inexpensiveselection of clones bearing the desired modifications.Mainly due to time constraints, the modification of the Lactobacillus genome was not realized.In the course of the project, several Cas9-fusion proteins were designed.", "human_practice": "Because of its futuristic yet approachable nature iGEM is able

our this year project and received a lot of valuable input concerning, for example legal matters of a genetically engineered probiotic, from attending professionals.Invited were students of life sciences, molecular medicine and, thanks to our efforts, iGEM teams from all over Germany.", "modeling": "For computation time reasons, the knock-out candidates were limited to those (36%) reactions that were more active in the FBA which minimizes G6P usage compared to a maximization.Unfortunately, the results were in the noisy range of numerical zero ((10^{-11})), and therefore inconclusive.After the inference of a model for Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCC 33200) failed, we used more comprehensive models of more distant related organisms.However, the database considers it a non-curated model, because the semantics has not been fully checked yet.Similar to the last analysis, pseudo-metabolites were used for creating an objective functions for the G6P metabolism.Thicker reaction arrows Fluxes are redistributed as a consequence of the knock-out (orange), leading to a decrease of Maltose phosporylase activity compared to the fluxes in figure 2.Our analysis involved flux balance analysis (FBA) of an inferred model for Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCC 33200), and a flux variability analysis (FVA) of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1.Despite these restrictions, the analysis at hand yielded already promising results and has saved numerous try and error runs, hence significant amounts of labor time and material.A Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) requires a detailed model, a so-called bottom-up reconstruction of the organism of interest, to be available.At no point we were able to bar the system from metabolising (alpha)-G6P.After disregarding unlikely candidates, the following pattern emerged in a visualization with the Escher tool, see figure 1 (King et al., 2015).For an illustration of the normal metabolism flow see figure 2, and how a successful (\beta)-G6P knock-out affects that flow see figure 3.Instead, we analyse the flow of metabolites through the metabolic pathways of a system (Orth et al., 2010).As a consequence, we suggested to test a knock-out of the phosphoglucomutase.Such a flow is computed with a flux balance analysis (FBA).FBA assigns to each possible reaction a quantity, called flux value, that specifies with which rate the reactants are converted into the corresponding product in correct stoichiometric proportions.Furthermore, we allowed the ranges of the FVA to deviate from the optimal solution by (10%) in order to account for some biological variability.Using FVA we identified (40) knock-out candidates, for which combinations of up to three reactions were tested.Afterwards, we used the feature lists of the PATRIC (Wattam et al., 2014) database to identify those reactions that are unique for each strain, and made according changes, although, we still retained those reactions with (70%) prevalence.For fulfilling an external function, metabolites can leave a system through outbound fluxes.Since a large collection of models had been created as part of the path1models project (B\u00fcchel et al., 2013), we initially attempted to adopt an automatically created model from BioModels datbase entries of relates species (see table 1).Caption: List of auto-generated BioModels entries which were used for the inference of a model for Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCCLactobacillus johnsonii CNCM I-12250 / La1 / NCC 533Our inference approach was to manipulate the model for the Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533.Within the limited time frame of this project and since only a model of a related species is available, the results found cannot be considered definite.However, we had to create an objective function for the G6P metabolism.We implemented such an objective by considering G6P production and usage separately.Comprehensive databases for models are the BioModels (Li et al., 2010) database hosted and maintained by EBI and the San Diego BiGG project (King et al., 2016).Until now, no manually curated model can be found in neither of these resources for the organism of interest: Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCC 33200).Concrete flux values\u0097that fulfill these inequalities and optimize the objective\u0097are easily computed by an algorithmic approach called Linear Programming.In order to construct these inequalities, knowledge about the pathways is needed, which comes in the form of a systems biological model.In our project, we are interested in the rates of metabolism for fructose and glucose.For the pseudo-metabolites, two outbound fluxes were added as new objective functions.Given these objectives, we conducted an FBA and tested knock-outs combinations of up to three reactions with the COBRApy package (Ebrahim, Lerman, Palsson, & Hyduke, 2013) in an iPython notebook (Perez & Granger, 2007) under usage of IBM s cplex optimizer.The simulation allowed the wet-lab group to reduce serendipities, and saved numerous try and error runs.In our simulations, we were unable to prevent (alpha)-G6P metabolism from taking place, because the metabolism is connected to more fluxes than the (\beta) isomer (nine compared to just two).Consequently, the corresponding analysis should have two objectives: maximize growth and minimize G6P metabolism.The mathematical formulation for the given criteria are then:The minimum of the range is (le 0) in both FVAs.The maximum of the range is (ge 0) in both FVAs.The means of the ranges from both FVAs differ more than (200).The analysis yields that a knockout of the (\beta)-phosphoglucomutase and the G6P-isomerase are able to prevent (\beta)-G6P metabolism.Consequently, suitable knock-out targets were based on a systemic analysis of genome-scale metabolic network models of related species by investigating the effect of virtual gene deletions on the biomass production.Our lab team selected the knock-out candidates glucose 6 phosphate isomerase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.These candidates were chosen by the following criteria:It is possible for the reaction to be both active and inactive in a living cell.It is possible for the reaction to be inactive if no G6P is metabolised.On average, the reaction is less active for minimal G6P metabolism.These criteria were tested by conducting two FVAs.FBA only finds a single solution (rate values for all fluxes) that optimize the objective functions under consideration of the specified constraints of the model.Based on the METACYC identifiers, we added those reactions for which (70%) of the other lactobacilli models contained an orthologue correspondents.In the following we concentrate on a model for Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 from the BioModels database with the ID MODEL1507180045.However, the complexity of such an analysis could easily be extended to a significantly larger study.Often, the objective function is an outbound flux.The latter two reactions were in our experiments.After assessing the results with the biochemists of our group, we conclude that the FVA was biologically reasonable.A possible objective it the maximization of the growth function.In contrast, the manually generated model of another Lacobacillus allowed sound knock-out testing.Unfortunately, no curated or at least auto-generated model is currently available for the organism of interest, Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCC 33200).This is even more so, because the knock-out candidates used in the experiments were verified by the FVA.The ranked list of the top 5 knock-out reactions read: Overview over the reactions identified as knock-out candidates andThe reaction top 14 is adenylate-kinase and top 15 is asparagine-synthetase, which are biologically unlikely knock-out candidates.A more precise question would have been to test if the atoms of G6P could be integrated in F6P of the glycolysis pathway.However, these fluxes are subjected to the following constraints:Mass conversion must be respected.The top candidates were the phosphoglucomutase, the G6P-isomerase, and the G6P-dehydogenase.In an optimal case, subsequent studies would be required that include the bottom-up reconstruction of the exact strain under study.The analysis for that question would involve a system with detailed description of cell compartments and a more sophisticated objective function.However, the absence of the knocked-out genes must not jeopardize the bacteria s ability to live and proliferate.", "notebook": "Liquid Cultures inoculated, Stabs created.Ligation of putative gBlocks ApaI-pRha, ApaI-constPromotor,Apa-Bam-Promotor-C7C7bind-RBS,

the laboratory stage?Our project is intended to be used in the laboratory.Our Team follows widely used laboratory protocols in an appropriate laboratory facility (biosafety level 1 laboratory, S1), as requested by German law (\"Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik (GenTG),\" German Gene Technology Law and \u0093Verordnung \u00fcber die Sicherheitsstufen und Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen bei gentechnischen Arbeiten in gentechnischen Anlagen (GenTSV)\u0094, Genetic Technology Safety Regulations Act) to guarantee the safety of the researchers and the public.The participation in regular meetings about laboratory safety is an essential element of the education at the University of Tuebingen.In the case of success with the Lactobacillus, we would have tested our system with fructose-intolerant yeast, which has the same safety properties as E. coli and L. johnsonii.How would your project be used in the real world?Furthermore, the Lactobacillus can only live in a fructose-rich environment, which prevents uncontrolled spreading.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?In the intestine, the Lactobacillus would digest the fructose, preventing negative side effects for the patient.However, lots of further research would be necessary to get to this application, especially as the Lactobacillus is a GMO.Glucose as a prime energy source of the cell will be sealed off by knocking out the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, thus leaving the Lactobacillus dependent on fructose.After the fructose is degraded, the Lactobacillus, incapable of digesting glucose, would lack further carbohydrate sources and die off.This also applies to the BioBricks used in our system.Since the Lactobacillus is a naturally in the intestine occurring bacteria and no new functions were introduced, the risk for the patients can be considered very low.What is the goal of the project?The engineered Lactobacillus will be able to uptake great amount of fructose, thereby reducing the fructose level of the surrounding.None of the parts we use are known to have any negative or harmful effect on humans or other organisms.Furthermore, the transformed Lactobacillus is nonviable outside a fructose-rich medium, which is another convincing fact regarding the absence of security concerns.A full proofed safety concept would be a central part of any further research on an application of our approach.Our Labwork is constantly overseen by Ph.D. students, postdocs, and professors of our institute, the Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry.According to the German Gene Technology Law, the bacteria, yeast, and recombinant DNA components are classified as S1 according to the German Gene Technology Law (GenTG).", "keywords": "indigoidine evaluating Instructions unambiguous description illustrations publication references achievements performance ", "track": "Therapeutics",

in the largest university in Honduras that it could have a positive impact on local communities and down the line mitigate the risk of disease transmission for leishmaniasis and other diseases prevalent in Honduras.So we concluded that not only is there a need for immunisation against Leishmaniasis, but the need is actually much greater than we had ever anticipated.A recording of part of the conversation with Dr. Valladares can be found here National Autonomous University of Honduras, TegucigalpaLeading on from the visit to the hospital, we were eager to learn more about the condition in Honduras, and to deepen our understanding of Leishmaniasis on a scientific level.One key issue which we identified in our discussions with stakeholders was that education is a factor in the spread of the disease.He also highlighted issues such as the lack of education as a factor which has led to the spread of the disease in previous years.From these conversations we learned a great deal about the positive and negatives of introducing a vaccine such as ours into the country.This system would ensure that we would have a much better chance of avoiding failure during preformulation studies and clinical trials and reaching the market than in Ireland, where often as low as 1 in every 10,000 compounds make it to the market following drug safety and efficacy studies (1).The poor populations of the world are not lab rats, they are human beings, just like us, who require just as high a standard of healthcare as we do.Having investigated the issue of leishmaniasis with some of the main stakeholders in the country, our next focus centred on what is it really like in an epidemic area ?Thankfully, multiple of these species are carried by the sandfly vector which we are immunising against.. A brief clip from our recording of the meeting with Dr. Carrasco can be found here:Now that we understood the condition on a scientific, clinical and epidemiological level in the country, we felt the need to gain an understanding of key regulators of Leishmaniasis control in the country.This poor compliance is a major problem as without completing the full course of treatment, the parasite can continue to spread and increase in severity.This provides the the answer to the first question.. Not only did he mention that around 2,700 cases present per year in the country, but as many people with the disease don\u0092t present, and many others refuse treatment, the figures of those infected in reality are actually much higher than the numbers reflected by this.In the youthful stages of project design, we had researched the vast epidemiology of Leishmaniasis as a neglected tropical disease, and read into the Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva protein, LJM11, as a solid solution for immunisation against the disease.Also, lack of compliance to the current treatment and lack of education about the disease would suggest that a prevention may be a much better solution than a treatment.Is the disease as prevalent as we had read?Also, as many are infected at a young age (early childhood), it is important that the vaccine can provide immunity against successive infection by different forms of the parasite leading to more severe infections, eg.But we felt there were many questions which still needed to be answered before we could be sure that it is a worthwhile investment of both time and money; Is our Limitless Lactis vaccination actually needed in the developing world?He emphasized that the vaccine would need to be cost-effective, we therefore decided to concentrate on developing a vaccine that could be orally administered.Many people with cutaneous Leishmaniasis lesions avoid presenting to their GP for reasons such as tradition and culture, and mainly because of a lack of education about the disease.Taking these points into account, the potential for the Limitless lactis vaccine to be utilised by the country seems very promising.However, even with such benefits in place, we learned that a system like this does impose some challenges.Leishmaniasis is a disease which resides primarily in the developing world, where the web is an underused resource.This backs the benefit of targeting our vaccine against this sandfly, as it covers a wide range of the disease subtypes.While in choluteca, we gathered information on the prevalence of the disease, the number of patients who seek treatment and factors that are thought to be involved in the spread of the disease.It would also open the opportunity that the vaccine could reach the suffering population of Honduras many years earlier than in the developed world (12-15 years), in which time it could save many lives and prevent the suffering of millions.We also spoke with Dr. Concepcion Zuniga, the current director of Leishmaniasis strategy control who offered us further insight into the regulatory aspects of treating this disease.Both researchers and regulators validated that this disease will only get worse if we do not do something in the future.Figure 1 Figure 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We chose Honduras due to the immense numbers of reported cases of Leishmaniasis in the country and due to the current climate of governmental support for the disease.Our investigations also led us to Golden Rice, we decided to use this as a tool to educate students on the benefits of producing genetically modified crops.In addition to this, the reduced expenditure on clinical trials and documentation during development could contribute to a reduction in the cost of the vaccine to the government, hence having an economical benefit to the country.This question set us off to Choluteca, a province in the south west of the country, where leishmaniasis is prevalent.When we visited Choluteca, we observed that the cause of the disease is multifactorial.Also, the current standard treatment for Leishmaniasis in the country (Glucantime, an Antimony based drug that can cause liver and kidney damage) consists of a series of painful 15ml intramuscular injections for 20 consecutive days.Photos with Dr. Cristian Valladares in Alonso Suazo hospital, TegucigalpaFollowing conversation with Dr. Valladares, we learned that several species of Leishmaniasis, from cutaneous to visceral are carried by Lutzomyia longipalpis, the sandfly which LJM11 induces immunity against.He is also part of the biosecurity council of Honduras.Figure 3: National Autonomous University of HondurasHere, Dr. Carrasco lectured us on both the immunology and the parasitology of Leishmaniasis.Therefore we felt that for treatment and prevention against leishmaniasis, it should not solely be pharmacological but also should include fostering interest in education, improvement of the water supply to the region and improving the community\u0092s diet.Thus, this realisation instigated the next step in our project - to reach out to those who live in the affected areas.We researched the areas affected by Leishmaniasis, and debated which country would be most beneficial to visit to find these answers.Having spoke to both officials in our university in Ireland and the National University of Honduras, we decided to organise the collection and donation of old, unwanted or unused equipment and consumables from our university.Our L.lactis vaccine has the capabilities to be given in a capsule formulation which is easy to use and appealing for the patients.Dr. Carrasco is head of Immunology and Parasitology in the University, and he is a leading expert on Leishmaniasis in the country.Because of this, we believe that us scientists and developers in the developed world who produce vaccines such as this have an ethical responsibility to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine before bringing it to the market in countries such as Honduras.When treatment is stopped, the parasite has a chance to recover as it wasn\u0092t fully eliminated from the host and therefore can continue to spread.The doctor also emphasised that distribution of the vaccine would be an important consideration, he spoke about the instability of certain medical products in the Honduran summer when temperatures can reach as high as forty degrees celsius.In addition we were informed of the under-diagnosis disease and that it is actually more prevalent than any statistic would indicate.Dr Alvaro Acosta also emphasised the need for the vaccine to be stable at high temperatures and the desirability for low cost distribution.The local doctor was very aware of the disease and provided us with information with regard to ways in which the disease could be prevented.This is why there is such a high demand for immunisation against the disease.Another issue which was emphasised and which we have seen previously through interaction with Dr Alvaro Acosta and Dr Cristian Valladeres was that there is poor patient compliance with the current treatment.Hence, the current lack of hope in Honduras in the battle against Leishmaniasis made it the perfect location to explore with our solution.Our outreach activities proved to be the most rewarding, having interacted with school children from the ages of 11 to 17, we learned about the impact that education has from a teacher\u0092s perspective.We also learned that the lack of diagnosis and treatment ensure that the life cycle of the parasite is maintained.Above: Yensi speaks to the Ernesto Caceres (Fyffes Medical doctor) about the prevalence of the disease.Having informed the doctor of our aim to produce a vaccine against leishmaniasis, he was quite interested.We soon realised that we were looking in the wrong places.This is especially important as public healthcare in the country doesn\u0092t cover everybody due to lack of funds.Another potential cause for the spread of the disease is due to the lifestyle of the people in the choluteca region.The presence of the sand-fly alone is problematic but the nature of this problem was amplified by factors such as education, hygiene and nutrition.Many use \u0093self-remedies\u0094 instead of standard treatment which can keep lesions at bay, but there is lack success in resolving of the condition as the parasite often returns.Firstly, talked with Dr. Carlos Ponce, the former director of Leishmaniasis strategy control in Honduras.Also, due to focus on the arbovirus Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, governmental support is distracted from Leishmaniasis.Fyffes have demonstrated loyalty to the community by building a school and a hospital for the local populace.Last year, approximately 700 cases of Leishmaniasis were reported in the Choluteca county alone (South western Honduras), and the numbers of cases seem to be increasing exponentially.As the parasite continues to move from sandfly to person and vice versa the untreated population act as a reservoir to ensure the infection will continue to spread rapidly.How would it add to current available prevention/treatment and provide benefit to the population?Would the regulatory bodies in afflicted regions approve of this therapeutic?This was revealed through our interactions with staff in the Alonso Suazo Hospital and with the doctor in Choluteca.Many patients were reported to stop visiting the hospital for the pentavalent antimony IM injections in the middle of the treatment because of the pain associated with the injection.We organised transportation of the equipment with Fyffes.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "The expected size was approximately 8000 bp.The gel was run as follows: pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 1, pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 3, pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 5, pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 9, pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 16, pNZ44 digested with XbaI, undigested pNZ44.Colonies 1, 3, 5 and 9 gave the expected size, it was concluded that these colonies were likely correct and sequencing could be carried out.Our initial strategy for the replacement of the IKK2 sgRNA with CMV sgRNA was discussed.6 transformations were performed with pNZ44 to troubleshoot transformation procedure.Two chloramphenicol plates were streaked with with MSP712 pNZ44 and Puc19 were transformed into C2987I with the aid of NEB protocol \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uncut pNZ44 diluted and undiluted plates both yielded a significant number of colonies \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Significant number of colonies on two Puc19 platesDEDUCTION FROM GEL: 3 bands at ~4,500 bp showed pcr worked for each tube.A restriction digest of MSP712 was performed with BamHI and XbaIA restriction digest of pCMVLuc was performed with NdeI and KpnIA plasmid prep of MSP712 was performed and result was a concentration of 64ng/ul A plasmid prep of pCMVLuc was performed and result was a concentration of 276ng/ul Repeated dcas9 PCR with the following adjustments (one variable altered in each of 3 dcas9 PCR\u0092s)A gel was ran with the resulting PCR products and a control.DEDUCTION FROM GEL: 3 bands at ~4,500 bp showed pcr worked for each tube.Split cells, P11, 2 from 7 into a T175 flask (20ml volume)5 ligations were carried out with the aid of the NEB E5520S HiFi DNA Assembly Kit:The ligations were subsequently transformed into C2987IDEDUCTION FROM TRANSFORMATION: ample colonies on 2 Puc19 plates as well as the two Gibson control plates (A+B) There was one colony on the dcas9 plate and a few colonies on the LJM11 plate also.The other set of digests used an enzyme which cut in the insert (EcorV).Lanes 1-4: pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colonies 1, 3, 5, 9 digested with XhoI.The pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA would be run on a gel and the top band removed using gel extraction and subsequently purified.The pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA would be run on a gel and the top band removed using gel extraction and subsequently purified.The following were altered in order to do this:There were six 1 microgram pNZ44 XbaI digests performed from a series of plasmid preps:The digests were then ran on a gel and deduction is as follows: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All appear to have cut cleanly as no traces of uncut visible on gel.With the aid of pIRFP Forward primer and pIRFP reverse primer a PCR was performed of pIRFP The PCR products were then digested with NdeI and EcoRI as well as with BamHI and HindIII pNZ44 was digested and a plasmid prep was performed.This would be cloned using the same Gibson assembly method which worked for the pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA construct.With the DNA distribution kit 7 transformations were completedA restriction digest K516032 was performed with Xpa and Pst1, a gel was ran of the digest and then a gel extraction was carried out.We completed a restriction digest and pIRFP amplification The following were transformed with the use of either Ampicillin or Chloramphenicol LB plates:A plasmid prep of J23119 was performed, then a restriction digest was carried out.The J23119 backbone was linearised.The gel was run as follows: Colony B1, C1 ,C2, C3, C4, C5, pNZ44 digested with SmaI and KpnI, pNZ44 uncut.The results were not as expected and these colonies were abandoned.MSLN was digested with PstI, which was expected to cut once and yield a single fragment of approximately 5kb.On the same gel pIRFP digested with KpnI and HindIII was run, with fragments expected at 3.5kb and 1 kb.The first step assembled Gibson fragment 1 and the digested vector (pNZ44), yielding a product A.Both the pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA and the CMV G-block would be digested with XbaI and SmaI.Both the pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA and the CMV G-block would be digested with XbaI and SmaI.Lane 10; MSP712 digested with EcoRVThis restriction mapping was deemed successful - the enzymes cut as expected and the correct size (approximately 8000 bp) was observed.MSLN colony A1, B1, B2, piRFP colony B1, B2, C1, C2, pNZ44 digested with KpnI and HindIIINone of the digests were of the expected size; they were all similar to the unligated vector.Following the results of this, the transformation via electroporation was deemed successful.Further restriction mapping of the pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA constructs was carried out.To check the ligations carried out earlier in the week a colony PCR was completed for: There was a gel electrophoresis with the PCR products.The corresponding gel was run which included cut pNZ44 for comparison purposes.DEDUCTION FROM GEL: bands all too short, also pirfp should be cut twice, not once.The digestion of several other pIRFP colonies was attempted with EcoRI only and also with EcoRI and NdeI.Colonies were seen on the plates and colony PCR was used in order to screen for positive colonies.A new method of assembly of the pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA construct was designed.This was because the dropout was very small (approximately 200bp) compared to the original plasmid (approximately 8000 bp).Thus, it was decided that we would use the second strategy, which was designed and for which the necessary G-block was ordered on the week beginning 8th August.It might not be possible to see if our double digest was successful - when run on a gel, as it would look the same as a single cut plasmid.6 transformations were performed-for each one plate with chloramphenicol, one without 12 plates.Result from transformations: No plates had colonies with the exception of uncut pNZ44 which only had 3.Uncut pNZ44 and Puc19 were transformed into competent cells C2987I in order to check the integrity of the transformation process.A new Gibson fragment 3 was ordered, which contained sgRNA against the CMV promoter instead of against the IKK2 promoter.pNZ44 was also digested with XbaI.DEDUCTION FROM GEL: pIRFP single cuts: Appears to have cut twice at ~3,500 and ~5,500 instead of once at ~4,500.This method would require the assembly of one insert into the vector, instead of the assembly of three inserts into the vector, which was previously attempted.The first gel was run as follows: Lanes 1-6: LJM11 colonies A1-A6, Lane 7: LJM11 colony B1DEDUCTION FROM GEL: LJM11 colonies A1, A2, A3, A6 and B1 were positive with bands at ~300bpThe second gel was run as follows and is shown below: Following successful colony PCR and restriction mapping, LJM11 colony A3 was sent to MWG for sequencing.It was not possible to see if our double digest was successful; when run on a gel, it looked the same as a single cut plasmid.This was because the dropout would be very small (approximately 200bp) compared to the original plasmid (approximately 8000 bp).A meeting with our supervisors and our secondary investigator took place.17 colonies in total were observed from the 8 plates onto which the dCas9-IKKBsgRNA-pNZ44 construct transformation was plated.A plasmid prep was performed with the generator (from DNA distribution kit).Resulting gel can be seen below(two ladders used 1 kb and 100b), lanes are as follows; Pirfp 1 double cut cut twice but too high.It was reasoned that colony PCR was not a suitable technique for such a large amplicon.Plasmid minipreps were made of the overnight liquid cultures.Several plasmid preps were completed with a variety of digestion productsDEDUCTION FROM GEL: Pirfp 1 cut twice but too high.No colonies on pIRFP or Mesothelin platesColony PCR was carried out using USP45 fp and pNZ44 RP.Single cut didnt appear.A double digest was competed with pIRFP1 with the enzymes EcoRI and NdeI.Overnights were prepared with the positive colonies.Planning for the next parts of the project was carried out, including protein work and cell culture work.Glycerol stocks of the successful pNZ44-USP45-His-LJM11 construct were made.GM17 broth and agar plates were made (find manufacturer of M17 for reference.All plates without chloramphenicol were contaminated.PCR was carried out of the Gibson assembly products using USP45 forward primer and pNZ44 reverse primer.This week, preparation for an experiment for the validation of our genomically modified L.lactisOur initial strategy for the replacement of the IKK2 sgRNA with CMV sgRNA was attempted.In the second approach, 10uL of both A and B were taken.In preparation for the LLO validation experiment, pFX-Luc was transformed into L.lactis subsp.We decided to abandon these colonies.A different approach to the assembly of the dCas9-IKKBsgRNA-pNZ44 construct was suggested and attempted.In the first approach, X, 5uL of both A and B was taken.?The plates were incubated aerobically for 48 hours.This proves that the problem is with transformation; DH5? is not taking up the plasmids.Two different volumes of the ligation products X and Y were added to 50uL cells.These would then be ligated using T4 DNA ligase.However, this method was not successful.Lane 8, negative control.There were no bands of the correct size.Lanes 6-9: dCas9 colonies 1, 3, 5, 9 digested with EcoRV.Results were not as expected:Gel 2: Lane 1-6, colonies 11-17 respectively.A G-block containing the CMV sgRNA would be cloned in using standard cloning.A G-block containing the CMV sgRNA would be cloned in using standard cloning.These would then be ligated using T4 DNA ligase.However, we reasoned that this method would be difficult.", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "", "keywords": "expression StarScaffold

global burden is expected to grow to 21.7 million new cancer cases and 13 million cancer deaths on account of rapid growth and aging of population[1] .According to data from SEER 18 2006-2012, present 5-year survival rate of lung cancer in the US is merely 17.7% (Fig.Namely, feasibility and efficacy of surgery is based on the type and stage of cancer, and for certain types, surgery is far from sufficient to eliminate the cancer.Radiation therapy is a therapy using ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells.[6]These striking figures deserve our attention and contemplation, driving us to dig out deeper understanding of cancer, develop appropriate policies for cancer control and design effective treatments for various cancer types.Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancer types and the leading cause of cancer-related death around the world[7] .The identification of distinctive mutations in various cancer has led to the booming development of molecular targeted therapy.Due to the adoption of lifestyles that are known to increase cancer risk, such as smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity and reproductive changes (including lower parity and later age at first birth) in developing country, it\u0092s reasonable to estimate that the actual figures will be considerably larger[2] .Therefore, cancer is becoming one of the leading causes of death and the major public health problem around the world (Fig.By far, smoking is widely recognized as the primary contributor to lung cancer.Traditional therapies for cancers vary from surgery, radiotherapy to chemotherapy.Surgery is the primary method of treatment for most isolated, solid cancer and may play a role in palliation of pain and prolongation of survival[12] .With high-quality data from an additional number of population-based registries now being available through the National Central Center Registry of China (NCCR), it s possible for us to have a general understanding of cancer incidence and mortality in China.According to Cancer Statistics in China (2015), there were about 4,292,000 newly diagnosed invasive cancer cases in 2015, meaning that almost 12,000 new cancer diagnoses averagely per day.However, it is still worth noting that despite this favorable trend, the number of cancer deaths substantially increased (73.8% increase) during the corresponding period because of the aging and growth of the population.Figure 6. a) Trends in Number of New cases and Deaths for All Cancer Combined by Sex: China, 2000 to 2011.As one of the most frightening death threat, cancer can be aggressive and malignant.And the five most common cancer sites are also the five leading causes of cancer death (Fig.Top 5 most common cancers and most common causes of cancer death in China (2015)[6]Two line charts below showed trends of cancer incidence and death rates from year 2000 to 2011, as well as trends of new cancer cases and deaths in China (Fig.Despite improvements in surgical techniques and combined therapies over the past several decades, lung cancer is still one of the most lethal cancers.It may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body.The table below shows 5-year relative surviving of lung cancer from year 1975 to 2008 in the US (Table.[6]Figure 6. b) Trends in Cancer Incidence and Death Rates (Age-standardized to the Segi Standard Population) for All Cancer Combined by Sex: China, 2000 to 2011.Although statistical trends may not be directly applicable to individual patients, they provide researchers, health professionals, and policy makers with essential information, helping them understand the impact of cancer on population and thus develop appropriate strategies to address the challenges that cancer poses to the society at large.And cancer must be one of the nightmares.Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.[3] [4] Cancer statistics describe what happens in large groups of people and provide a picture of the burden of cancer on society.Besides, lung cancer is also attributable to increasing age, radon gas, asbestos, air pollution, as well as inherited factors[1] .Two main categories of lung cancer are classified according to histological types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).As a class, NSCLC is relatively insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy compared with SCLC[9] .Treatments of lung cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapies, based on types and stages.Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy as well, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancer cases[13] .Chemotherapy is another conventional cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs, called chemotherapeutic agents, as part of a standardized chemotherapy regimen.For instance, Gefitinib, as an EGFR inhibitor, is unable to deal with KRAS mutation in NSCLCs.In view of serious situation of cancer incidence and mortality, and drawbacks of current treatments, it s worth developing a much more effective drug system and this is what our project focus on.Our ideal drug system will contain some basic features as follows:First, it is designed to be targeting and systemic.Over the past 40 years, the most common cancer sites have changed little.In general, five-year survival situation will be more optimistic when patients being diagnosed lung and bronchus cancer at an earlier stage.Lung, liver, stomach and bowel cancers have been the four most common causes of cancer death since 1975[5] .Figure 3.Top 5 most common cancers and most common causes of cancer death in male/female (2012)Cancer incidence and mortality have maintained vigorous growth in China, making cancer the leading cause of death since 2010, corresponding to global trend.The figure below reveals international variation in lung cancer incidence published in Global Cancer Facts & Figures (3rd edition, 2015) (Fig.Furthermore, their depending on the same chemical entity leads to the difficulty of transplanting to another mutation or cancer case.Globally, an estimated 1.8 million new cases occurred in 2012, accounting for approximate 13% of total cancer diagnoses[2] .7).Figure 7. International Variation in Lung Cancer Incidence Rates, 2012.https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics[9] Fact Sheets About Lung and Bronchus Cancer.Since KRAS mutation in lung cancer was first reported in mid-1980s and remained the most commonly mutated oncogenes in unselected patients, they have risen to fame as elusive targets in a rapidly-evolving field of molecular therapeutics.Moreover, it can be very expensive in some cases.Since cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease with variants having different genetic and biological properties, drugs targeting a specific molecule that interferes with cancer growth or metastasis are much helpful and effective to ensure that patients will receive optimum management and can be an ideal choice for further exploration.http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/lungb.html[10] Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u0096Health Professional Version.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy[15] Cancer Treatment.KRAS-mutant lung cancer accounts for approximately 25% of NSCLC, representing an enormous burden of cancer worldwide.https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects[17] Cancer immunotherapy.Namely, our drug aims at tumor cells and once metastasis appears, it can be a treatment for the whole body as well.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer[8] Cancer Statistics.[1] Global Cancer Facts & Figures (3rd edition), 2015.2015; 00: [3] Worldwide Cancer Incidence.Besides, 1 in 7 deaths was related to cancer, and cancer caused more deaths than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.[5] Worldwide cancer mortality statistics.There are different types of cancer cases and each case has its distinctive mutations in specific oncogenes.In some countries, for women, it is now the leading cause of cancer death surpassing breast cancer.Once the spread, also known as metastasis, isn\u0092t well controlled, it can result in death[1] .The harmful effects of cancer on individual, family and society are enormous and appalling.Figure 1.It is estimated that approximately 2,814,000 Chinese died from cancer in 2015, corresponding to more than 7,500 cancer deaths on average per day (Fig.And it may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after the surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor.Literally, about 22,000 cancer deaths happened a day.Hence, it is much easier for us to design a derived drug based on the same silencing and delivery system.International Agency for Research on Cancer of WHO and Cancer Research UK.", "description": "Our project aims to construct a safe and efficient drug delivery system targeting specific oncogene to provide a new strategy of cancer therapy.", "design": "Then, our site-specific exosomes could deliver siRNA to tumor tissue.filter_dramaConstruction of an efficient drug delivery systemDuring experiment, we transfected siRNA plasmid and target plasmid (coding our engineered fusion protein) into HEK293 cells to obtain exosomes with KRAS siRNA inside and iRGD peptide on their surface membranes.However, due to the short half-life period and poor cellular uptake of exogenous siRNA[3], an efficient delivery vehicle is needed to stabilize and enhance the naked small interference molecule s function.We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express a fusion protein composed of the exosomal membrane protein Lamp2b and the tumor-targeting short peptide iRGD.As a consequence, the inhibited expression of KRAS oncogene will repress the proliferation of tumor cells, ultimately presenting therapeutic effects on lung cancer.photoFig3.In theory, the delivery of KRAS siRNA to tumor cells will be achieved, whereas non-specific uptake of KRAS siRNA in other tissues will be avoided.When the shRNA plasmids of KRAS are transfected into HEK293 cells, the dsRNA is cleaved into siRNA of KRAS by the enzyme Dicer, and then target KRAS mRNA.Then we designed anti-KRAS siRNA as a therapeutic agent to degrade KRAS mRNA, therefore, repressing the expression and function of K-ras protein.In this way, the expression of KRAS will be potently shut down.The mutation rate of KRAS can be up to 25% in NSCLC (a main type of lung cancer)[2].Once fused into tumor cells, KRAS siRNA will be released, targeting and destroying KRAS mRNA.Then the iRGD peptide can guide exosomes to the specific tumor tissue.KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in lung cancer.It uses siRNA segments to destroy specific mRNA, thereby, shut down the expression of target genes.Schematic diagram of modified exosomes loded with siRNA silencing KRAS oncogene[1] Aagaard L, Rossi JJ.Generally, the project design can be divided into three portions: (1) RNAi module; (2) targeting module; (3) RNAi module and targeting module assembly.RNA interference (RNAi) is an emerging technology of gene silencing.When the modified exosomes are injected into the bloodstream, the iRGD peptide will guide exosomes deep into tumor tissue and the exosomes will specifically recognize tumor cells.By genetically engineering the iRGD peptide to the outer membrane portion of Lamp2b, Lamp2b can bring the iRGD peptide to the surface of exosomes.RNAi has been demonstrated as a novel treatment modality of cancer and we decided to utilize this technology to silence the expression of specific oncogene[1].Lamp2b (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2b) is a protein found specifically abundant on the surface of exosomes.We connected iRGD to Lamp2b using a glycine-linker to construct our fusion protein and promoted its expression by the promoter Pcmv.Exosomes for targeted siRNA delivery across biological barriers.[6] Sugahara KN1, Teesalu T, Karmali PP, Kotamraju VR, Agemy L, Girard OM, Hanahan D, Mattrey RF, Ruoslahti E. Tissue-penetrating delivery of compounds and nanoparticles into tumors.Therapeutic siRna: Principles, challenges, and strategies.Thus, we picked KRAS as our target oncogene.Evidence that K-ras mutations are an early and irreversible event in the development of adenocarcinoma of the lung.Our project aims to construct a safe and efficient drug delivery system targeting specific oncogene to provide a new strategy of cancer therapy.Through these modifications, exosomes will be conferred on tumor-targeting ability.photoFig 2.", "human_practice": "Among the three, chemotherapy comprised 88.71%, accounting for the highest number of votes, showing that everyone considers \"cancer\" and \"chemotherapy\" closely linked.It could be learnt from the question 2 that, chemotherapy plays highest application in cancer clinical treatment, accounting for 87.1% of all investigated patients, which made chemotherapy the most well-known one.Now when it came to new drugs, it surprised us that around 1/4 of the patients already know about molecular targeted drugs and other new drugs, and 14.52% of patients have received new therapy treatment, showing that patients are no longer unfamiliar with targeted therapy and other new treatments now.In addition, after interviewing with the patients face to face, we also learned more of the current status of clinical cancer treatment and patients  actual thoughts and real needs, enabling us more aware of the importance and urgency of developing new drug therapy, which proved the significance of our topic.Most of the patients desire to try the new drugs, but the amount of patients who meet genetic testing standards and requirements of targeted therapy are still limited.This result demonstrates that people in China still hold a superficial and inadequate perception in the cognition of the malignant degree and the death rate of cancer.The attitude towards cancer treatment and new therapies? Of the 780 respondents, curative efficacy and side effects were their top priority concern if selecting cancer treatment.? Under the influence of \"Wei Zexi incident\" (a malpractice due to deceptive advertising of immune therapy), 40.86% of the respondents worried about the curative effect and side effect of immune therapy as a new therapy for cancer, and 31.04% said they are afraid to be cheated and take advantage of by criminals when try a new therapy.For example, advanced patients may experience struggle when breathing, chest tightness, persistent cough, and that lung cancer can also be transferred to all other parts of the body, such as brain, bones, causing severe pain, intracranial hypertension, weakness and other symptoms.? There are 3 main treatments for advanced lung cancer: chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy.Would you be willing to try it if it was put into clinical practice?Survey results on attitude towards the new drug showed that, only 14.52% holds absolute negative attitude to new drugs, and most of the patients and their families think it as acceptable, although 43.55% said they will make decisions in specific circumstances, and the cost, the curative effect, genetic testing are all the factors that need to be taken into account.Consistent with the question 5, we could easily find that, with more than half respondents expressing this concern, the largest concern of patients and their families was that new drugs lack longstanding clinical cases.The cost of the new therapies can be prohibitive, thus the patients shrink back at the sight of the price.Molecular targeted drugs of our team have little side effects, can be taken orally, and are of good therapeutic effect for specific gene mutational patients.Also, doctors would rationally suggest the appropriate patients to actively try new therapies including targeted therapy.We also learned that, there exists many patients who tried target detection but at last not eligible for targeted therapy; For those who apply targeted therapy, only half of them are receiving good effect, while the other patients choose to give up targeted therapy and regress to traditional treatment due to trivial effect or unaffordable medical expenses.For different treatment methods, which part do you think is more important?The results of question 3 showed that, regardless of treatment types, patients value the efficacy superior to other factors.? The emergence of targeted drugs allow the basic research apply into clinical cases, leading a revolution in the field of oncology.? Now, for those who can take targeted drugs, that is patients with sensitive mutations, we can practice molecular targeted drugs combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy at the same time, enabling patients to survive up to three years --- such a survival period is pretty remarkable.Interview with patients in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute & HospitalDuring your treatment, what kinds of treatment did you receive?Result of question 1 showed that, chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy were the most well-known 3 treatments to patients and their families.However, the patient did have a good understanding of new therapy, and he showed us some of the new cancer treatment that he knew before.Recently, the so-called \"four carriages\" of cancer treatment are surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular targeting drugs.However, 41.94% patients said they were very willing to try, and believed that the new technology should be well developed and progressed to better fight against cancer--even if the price is expensive, it is still worthy to try.Our findings are compatible with our initial assumptions.At present, the unaffordable price of molecular targeted drugs still block the way towards actual clinical use.Several months ago, Ms. Meng felt stomach pain very occasionally, but she thought it was just a small stomach problem.Their professional experience and advices are valuable if we want to apply synthetic biology to a broader clinical field in the near future.? Early diagnosis is vital for lung cancer patients as only detection and surgery in the early stage can hold the possibility of cure.At the same time, metastatic cancer cells were also detected in his liver, forming two lesions of different size.Now he mainly takes treatment combining chemotherapy and interventional therapy.At present, the main side effects of chemotherapy on Ms. Meng is nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite etc..Since Ms. Meng hasn\u0092t been treated for a long time, she did not know much about the updating treatment method specifically.However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies, the cost of drugs needs to be abridged if we expect to apply the updating research to clinical treatment, which may indicate the direction of our future work.With the emergence of targeted drugs, the clinical treatment of tumors upswing to a molecular level.Most people learn about it from media reports, even though they are uneven in quality.? While the respondents generally recognize that if detected early, cancer can be treated and cured in time, the data notes that there are still nearly 15% of respondents identifying cancer as a terminal and incurable disease.There are not many patients who have relatively well-off condition like Ms. Chen, and more than half of the patients cannot afford molecular target therapy thus rely on the medical insurance reimbursement.The drugs enter mainly from the artery to surround the tumor, and block the blood vessel supplying nutrients for cancer cells, commonly known as \"starve cancer cells\".Chemotherapy treatment costs 5-6k RMB (around 890$) each time, and interventional treatment charges the same.At the same time, efforts should be made to diminish the cost of molecular targeted therapy as much as possible, becoming affordable for more patients and families and permitting continuation of more lives.She did not know that it was rectal cancer until she went to the hospital for a colonoscopy.During the 8 years, Ms. Guo has experienced two surgeries.The five-year survival rate of clinical lung cancer (i.e., the probability of the patients who still alive five years after diagnosis.)If the doctor considers her suitable for molecular targeted therapy, Ms. Meng will be really willing to try the new drug.Ms.If side effects can be minimized, patients will received an utmost degree of relief.Good curative effect and little side effect for the gene mutational patients are consistent with the advantages of our molecular target drugs, which is very practical and meets the real demands of patients.At the same time, we are very moved to see that, Ms. Guo, who was suffering from cancer, still concerned about the promotion of cancer therapy.This showed that there is still much room for improvement and perfection of medical insurance system in China.Besides, some patients still had doubts about the specific efficacy of new drugs, worrying they cannot receive fine curative effect even after paying high fee.For both sides, we participated in a series of engagement exercises, including consulting with patients and doctors about potential application spaces for our research technology, educational and investigating outreach to the local Nanjing community, and collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to improve their projects and presentations.We believe science is everywhere and it is a part of each person\u0092s everyday life.? Now numerous people blame the cause of lung cancer on environmental problems, but even in a good environment condition, the incidence of lung cancer is equally high.? Before targeted drug therapy, advanced lung cancer patients have an average survival period that is no more than one year, and that with other means of therapy (e.g.? An important significance of molecular targeted drugs is that, in the past, most drugs are searched and then acquired by human from the nature, but the molecular targeted drugs is a re-creation of human with certain purposes, thus a great revolutionary breakthrough.Yet because the examination results showed that her gene type does not match targeting drugs, thus she gave up targeted drug therapy.\u0091Side effects\u0092 accounted for the second, as cancer patients suffered a great trauma both physically and mentally.After accept chemotherapy, Ms. Guo suffers from side effects like vomiting, hair loss, limbs weakness, etc.As Ms. Guo\u0092s husband told us, the reimburse they received is more limited, because they came for treatment from another province, which is defined as non-local insurance.? In 2004 after the listing of the molecular targeted drugs iressa (also known as Gefitnib), situation has been greatly changed.Teng did not take new treatments such as molecular targeted drugs into account because he thought it may not be practicable, and he emphasized the use of chemotherapy to get his situation under control.The emergence of molecular targeted drugs, combined with a reasonable quantity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has promoted a huge progress compared to a dozen years ago.? One or two decades ago, doctors would have thought it irrelevant to his treatment if they heard about a mutation in a patient s genetic site.To some extent, it can be said that the leading cause of lung cancer is smoking.The biggest problem of our targeted drugs, currently, is actually about the price, since they cannot be covered in the medical insurance system and there is no policy support.24.75% said they would believe the latest research achievements, while only 3.34% expressed entrust or even rejection of immune therapy.? With a brief introduction of the background of molecular targeted drugs (e.g.There are many teams focusing on technical problems on the interaction between targeting drugs and their models, but the acceptance and trust issues from patients are less discussed.Iressa), 64.87% of respondents were open to molecular targeting drugs and consider it acceptable, while 18.27% respondents were worried about the high expense, which they may be unable to afford.Ms. Guo hopes that the government could provide some authoritative medical journals for patients like them, enabling patients to understand the latest researches from the formal channels, and to get a better comprehending of the therapies that suit them.Medicare reimbursement for cancer patients covers about 50% of the expense, including repayment for about 90% of drugs costs, but this does not include imported drugs or molecular targeted drugs.Mr.Notably, among the 780 valid surveys, only 39.1% are aware of that, during the last decade in China, LUNG cancer made the highest mortality rates amid all types of cancers; 30.9% chose liver cancer, which is of the same high degree of malignancy with Lung cancer; the remaining 30% people choose other types of cancer.Firstly, targeted drugs can be taken orally, removing troublesomeness of hospitalization, providing more convenience;Thirdly, it concerned with genes associated with the disease, offering efficacy for specific populations.Now she depends mainly on the treatment combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy.? Education level: 66.67% for bachelor degree, the survey group basically has the education background of high school or above.? Family economic conditions: the vast majority of respondents are of well-off level.The respondents\u0092 understanding of cancer is relatively simple, one-sided and inadequate.The way of understanding cancer is limited.There are also some severe complications along with lung cancer, resulting in plummeted life quality after the illness.In order to offer better understanding about synthetic biology and the targeting therapy applied in our project, we did a grand scaled questionnaire on social network and then gathered data for a thorough analogy.? Age distribution: 18~50 years of age accounted for the dominant.Added with fees of chemotherapy and infusion of nutritional supplement, the monthly treatment will be costing at least 30 thousand (4,500$) RMB.? In the past few decades, molecular targeting drugs visibly elongated the patient s survival periods and improve the disease control.Every 21 or 28 days she goes to the hospital for a session of chemotherapy.After the surgery she continued chemotherapy treatment for continuous control, adhering to the check every 3 months.High charge was also one of the main concerns of patients.The doctor suggest two treatment options, one of which is to remove these polyps from anus, and the other option is to apply minimally invasive surgery for the removal of polyps.Some of these ads might be false, yet desperate patients still try to contact them as if they are clutching at the straws of their lives.In our project, attitudes of patients is correspondingly valued, so we interviewed doctors from Drum-tower Hospital (Its oncology department is the National Key Clinical Specialist) for their opinions on patients\u0092 acceptance and our project.Also, while displaying our poster, we had close talks with numerous teams, introducing the project design and progress, and shared our achievements and experience when working on the project.Extensive discussion with other iGEM teams at Zhejiang University.In July, 2016, our teammates attended an iGEM communication summit organized in Zhejiang University.Life quality during treatment can be greatly improved from the patient s perspective.At that time, as she was found in the middle stage of the cancer, the doctors performed the surgery to remove the lesion.Ever since Ms. Guo\u0092s treatment, they have spent more than 200k RMB (30,000$) on medical expenses, which add up to be a very heavy burden for them.At the same time, Ms. Guo told us that there are a lot of people distributing leaflets and ads around the hospital.Our instructor is introducing our lab to high school studentsOn Aug 20th, we held a lecture to the participants of a biology summer camp held by Nanjing University, who were high school students from all over China.Also, compared to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, molecular targeted drugs with more specifically design, cause far less side effects.? Most of our chemotherapy drugs perform by intravenous infusion, so patients need to be hospitalized.Yet lots of molecular targeted drugs are kinase inhibitors of small molecules, which can be made into oral dosage, providing patients with great convenience.To better understand the current situation of cancer treatment and further shape our project direction, we interviewed a doctor from Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School (also known as \u0091Drum-tower Hospital\u0092) for a broad view of therapeutic concern from professional perspective.The most commonly used two means, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, were developed only after World War II.Chemotherapy is to use cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells, and inhibit the growth of tumor cells.The suggestion would not only be used for the further improvement of our project, but also provide a general concept of the safety issue that must be dealt with when synthetic biology encounters clinical medicine.After the talk, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory where our experiments were taken.Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) is a national iGEM communication summit hosted by Chinese universities.The patient told us that, molecular targeted therapy treatment can cost hundreds of thousands RMB per years.We should also keep working to support the promotion of tumor therapy and the elimination of false advertising.Team NJU-China tried to introduce synthetic biology to people through various ways.Therefore, Mr. Zheng cannot afford the treating charges, although he believes that treatment consisting of chemotherapy controling the disease and targeted drugs is ideal.After the discussion, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory.? Among the treatments of lung cancer, surgery is generally practiced on early patients.When told that targeted treatment costs about 30k RMB (around 4500$) per month, she considered it as acceptable and affordable.It was in May or Apr., 2016, Mr. Teng went for examination due to abdominal pain.? The majority of respondents still have a fear of malignancy cancer, which is believed to be their nightmare scenario.In this way, for some ordinary wage-earning-class families, the medical expenses would be a big problem for them.However, 2/3 of the patients are diagnosed too late and have already lost the chance of being cured.From the perspective of patient and his family, gene therapy in Japan is currently more advanced and developed, including a relatively well-known therapy called AK therapy.CCiC schedule simulates that of iGEM Giant Jamboree, with each undergraduate team presenting their project and display posters, seeking out to be an academic conversation and experience sharing conference, while providing an interactive platform for training teams at the same time.The CCiC was held at Hedanqing Hall of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, with 28 teams from all over China participated.Long story in short, most of the patient we interviewed showed positive mental conditions, but the economic situation of their families could be uneven.To some extent, chemotherapy is of certain specificity, but it still terribly influences normal cells;Now there are some drugs for chemotherapy with less side effects.Many patients and their families told us that they would still strive for an ideal treatment no matter how expensive it might be, as long as it can guarantee efficiency.Mr. Teng has fundamental information related new therapy, but his understanding of cancer and therapies still left deviation.Mr.At first, he thought it might be a gastrointestinal disease, but later results showed that it was actually pancreatic cancer.It was founded with the aim of idea-sharing, communication and cooperation among iGEM teams, and promoting high-level discussion of advanced issues pertaining to the promotion of international Biosynthesis issues.The NJU iGEM team believes there are two main aspects of \u0093Human Practices\u0094: public outreach to the non-technical community as well as education engagement; and collaboration within the academic and iGEM community.Our presentation won unanimous praise from the judges and audience, as well as attracted many spectators to interact with us in the Q&A section.For example, he mentioned a \u0091cancer cell hunger therapy\u0092 discovered in Zhejiang University, and also interference therapy from Japan.", "modeling": "We next investigate the effect of p, ? on metastasis:We create a gradient of p=0.95, 0.94, ..., 0.8 and performed the simulation:The results show that increasing the resistance of normal lymphocyte (increasing ?) and control the survival rate of tumor cells (decreasing p) help to inhibit the metastasis.Increasing the resistance of normal lymphonode to tumorigenesisWe now know that we can achieve 2 by surgery, and strategy 3 is the potential application field of our research.? is the growth rate of tumor cells in terms of size.P measures the survival rate of tumor cells during metastasis.? represents strategy 1, which is roughly proportional to the resistance of normal cells to malignant cells?We also create the following switch for simulation?The biological meaning of the switch is that there exists a period of time when metastasis hasn\u0092t been noticed (t < 0.2T).We then performed numerical simulation as below.We first simulate the control status with parameter below:I0=10, ?=1.5, ?=1.5, ?=0.1, ?=0.3, p=0.95, T=100The result shows that by combing strategy 2 and 3 we successfully delay the metastasis time of tumor cells.We create a model to test whether our strategy outperforms traditional surgery in terms of preventing metastasis of lymphoma.? measures the growth rate of tumor cells in terms of number.", "notebook": "Transfection of Mammalian Adherent Cells Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent(Life Technologies?11668019); (1) When the mammalian cells reached approximately 70%-80% confluence, they were transfected with the labelled siRNA; (a) Dilute DNA/RNA in serum-free Opti-MEM or reduced serum culture (1:4), mix by pipette gently; (b) Dilute Lipofectamine 2000 in serum-free Opti-MEM or reduced serum culture (1:4), incubate at room temperature for 5 min; (c) Mix the diluted DNA/RNA and the diluted Lipofectamine 2000, incubate for 5min; (5) Wash the cell with 2ml PBS once to make sure culture media is completely removed?

"Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of KRAS mRNA levels in A549 cells without any treatment (NC), transfected with non-loaded exosomes (exosome) and transfected with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA (siRNA-exosome) shows that exosomal KRAS siRNA can down-regulate KRAS expression in transcription level.1.5 The iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA efficiently arrests cancer cell proliferation in vitroKRAS over-expression has been demonstrated to promote the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells and be involved in migration and invasion of lung cancer.The results suggested that exosomes modified by targeting ligands could be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications in our project.filter_dramaSilencing capability validation in vitro1.1 KRAS siRNA interference efficiency verification in vitroTo ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA, we transfected the plasmid loaded with this siRNA into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and extracted protein to perform western blot.Pathological section of tumor tissues from model mice treated with PBS or iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA (exosome).2.5 iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA reduce the KRAS expression in tumor cells in vivoThen, total protein and RNA were extracted from the rest tumor tissues to evaluate the expression level of KRAS in vivo.The western electrophoresis and knockdown data obtained from qPCR analysis of KRAS gene expression indicated that KRAS protein and mRNA levels both dramatically decreased in the cells incubating with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA compared with cells treating with nude exosomes or without any treatment.Later, the EDU assay further ascertained the biological role of KRAS siRNA in cell proliferation suppression in vitro.To perform in vivo validation, none-small cell cancer mouse model was established after implanting tumor in 40 mice by subcutaneous injection with A549-LUC cells.(**: p < 0.01)filter_dramaSilencing capability validation in vivo2.1 Establishment of none-small cell lung cancer mouse model with 40 mice to perform validation experiment in vivoThe iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can be released into A549 cells and suppress the expression of KRAS in vitro.The administrations were given five times for 2 successive weeks since contamination of HEK293 cells resulted in exosomes shortage and the treatment of mice were delayed.2.3 The measurement of tissues harvested indicates the function of KRAS siRNA on the tumor treatmentSubsequently, mice were sacrificed for tumor harvest after in vivo imaging.As a consequence, K-ras protein\u0092s reduction and disturbed function will both result in the inhabitation of the proliferation of cancer cells, which ultimately have some therapeutic effects on lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer in this case).To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, we transfected it into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and then extracted protein from these cells to perform western blot.Cell proliferation assay for A549 cells treated with PBS or transfected with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA (exosome).Left panel: western blot analysis of KRAS protein levels in cells without any treatment (Nude) or treated with negative control siRNA (NC, siRNA targeting at a random sequence) and transfected with anti-KRAS siRNA using Lipo2000.After a short-time treatment, tumors harvested from killed mice were measured, then protein and RNA extracted from these tissues were examined, results supporting that KRAS siRNA can efficiently suppress KRAS expression, inhibit cell proliferation and thus have its potential to be taken as a cancer treatment.Subsequently, we collected iRGD-modified exosomes loaded with KRAS siRNA, evaluating its effect on lung cancer cells (A549) by examining KRAS expression after transfection.Our results had demonstrated that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can be delivered into tumor cells and efficiently down-regulate KRAS expression both in vitro and in vivo.Significant down-regulation of K-ras can be observed in A549 cells treating with anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, compared with the control group, demonstrating that anti-KRAS siRNA has a gene silencing effect on lung cancer cells.Though the down-regulation is not that evident, it still demonstrated that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can efficiently be delivered into tumor cells and regulate target gene expression, taking the short time of treatment into account.Figure 12.Significant down-regulation of K-ras can be observed in A549 cells treated with anti-KRAS siRNA, demonstrating that anti-KRAS siRNA has the gene silencing effect on lung cancer cells.Figure 2.Our project aimed to develop a drug system that employed modified exosomes with iRGD peptide on its surface to deliver KRAS-siRNA into lung cancer cells specifically, thus target KRAS gene and down-regulate K-ras protein expression to treat lung cancer cases.Second panel: the imaging of tumor-bearing mice treated with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA.Results showed both KRAS protein and mRNA level were reduced in tumor cells of mice injected with KRAS-siRNA-iRGD-exosomes compared with mice treated with PBS.Anti-KRAS siRNA transfected into A549 cells successfully reduced KRAS expression.In silencing validation, we transfected KRAS siRNA into A549 cells using Lipo 2000 and performed western blot to test the function of our siRNA.Then we synthesize the shRNA sequence from a DNA synthesis company (Genscript).We packaged KRAS siRNA into exosomes by transfecting HEK293 cells with a plasmid expressing KRAS siRNA and then collected siRNA-encapsulated exosomes.(d) Results attained after measurement of exosomes.1.4 The iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA suppressed KRAS expression in A549 cells in vitroWe next evaluate the effect of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA on KRAS expression in vitro.Right panel: protein quantitative analysis made for intuitive support that anti-KRAS siRNA can suppress KRAS expression.1.2 TEM imaging of exosomes carrying KRAS siRNA and expressing iRGD peptide on their membraneFigure 4.In other words, iRGD exosomes KRAS siRNA can effectively induce tumor

membrane.iRGD is a tumor-penetrating peptide that can increase vascular and tissue permeability.The KRAS expression level was assayed in A549 cells after co-cultured with exosomal KRAS siRNA.To examine the consequence of KRAS knockdown by anti-KRAS siRNA in vivo, we built a non-small cell lung cancer mouse model for in vivo experiment.The result indicated that KRAS knockdown had an anti-proliferation effect on lung tumor cells while nude exosomes were not capable of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of KRAS mRNA level in tumor cells after treatment of PBS and KRAS-siRNA-iRGD-exosomes (exosome).One group received PBS injections, the other group is treated with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA via tail-vein injections.Right panel: Quantitative analysis of cell proliferation rate, indicating that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can effectively suppress cell proliferation.This result suggests that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can deliver siRNA into target cells and finally reduce the KRAS expression.Figure 6.To enhance the accuracy of drug delivery system and improve targeting index of drugs, iRGD peptide was displayed on the surface of the exosome containing our previously designed siRNA, allowing us to target recipient cells in vivo efficiently.It serves as an element of the Team NJU-CHINA RNAi module which can be used for down-regulation of KRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells.For further verification, we examined the role of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA in cell proliferation.Quantitative analysis of tumor weight measurement for mice treated with PBS or KRAS-siRNA-iRGD-exosomes (exosome).After measurement of tumors, HE staining was conducted to verify the function of iRGD-exosomal siRNA.Once inside cells, KRAS siRNA will bind to KRAS mRNA through base-pairing and digest the mRNA, resulting in sharp decrease of K-ras in lung cancer cells.The result confirmed that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA could effectively down-regulate KRAS transcription level and reduce its protein expression.TEM image of iRGD-modified exosomes packaging KRAS siRNA1.3 Nanoparticle tracking analysis to ascertain the relationship between protein concentration and exosomes quantity We then asked NUDT_CHINA to help us perform nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for a further evaluation of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes.To be more meaningful, we purified the batch of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA for liquid fill, completing a full process including experiment design, compounds synthesis, effect test and drug production.When modified exosomes being intravenously injected, they will specifically recognize integrin receptors and fuse with lung adenocarcinoma cells under the direction of the iRGD peptide.The areas that emit fluorescence in the mice bodies represent labeled tumors (tumors developed from the implanted A549-LUC cells), which helps us to monitor the tumor growth, location and metastasis.An EDU assay using Cell-Light\u0099 EdUTP Apollo\u00ae567 TUNEL Cell Detection Kit, was carried out after siRNA-iRGD-exosome incubation and as a control, nude exosomes were also treated to A549 cells.The intensity of tumor fluorescence in mice treated with KRAS-siRNA-iRGD-exosomes showed dramatically decrease compared with the group treated with PBS.We designed specific KRAS siRNA with algorithm based on a software developed by SYSU-Software team.Under measurement condition listed, the exosomes secreted by HEK293 cells were assayed for 2.95 E8 particles each milliliter.(****: p < 0.0001)2.2 Mice were divided to receive different treatment, testing the function of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNAMice were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n=20 per group) and treated differently.He showed that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, could deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice.iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to ?? integrin-positive breast cancer cells in vitro as demonstrated by confocal imaging and flow cytometry.This tool can find the best siRNA sequence on target gene KRAS to

used to assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms.In the molecular cloning experiment, the KLF4 to be cloned is combined with vector DNA to generate recombinant DNA molecules.However, anthocyanin cannot kill cancer cells and prevent more from growing in our bodies effectively.Anthocyanin is a type of natural flavonoid and antioxidant with powerful anti-cancer properties.We also found normal cells can t endure high concentration of anthocyanin for a long time.Fig4.CCK-8 kit to test the cell viability of cell linesThese experiments showed anthocyanin was a kind of powerful anti-cancer substance.KLF4\u0092s expression in different cancer cell lines5.We constructed KLF4 over-expression and 5 mutant plasmids.1)Design 6 templates with specific restriction sites for cloningAfter 3 weeks, we selected one KLF4 over-expression cell line from HEK293T cell with G418.Anthocyanin can also make cancer cells not be successfully diffused, thereby protecting the healthy cells not being eroded by cancerous ones.Kruppel-like-factor 4?KLF4?is a zinc-finger transcriptional factor that regulate gene expression.Anthocyanin works as a natural colorant in food with health-promoting properties, which could protect our hearts and boost our cancer defense, and during the process of preventing and curing cancer, doctors always encourage patients to use anthocyanin-like foods and drugs.Another truth is , cancer cells will tolerate it after a long time of taking in anthocyanin.KLF4 downregulated in some cancer cells to help its cancer

while HEK293T cells dead after 6 days with anthocyanin treatment.This is single cell then can be expanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria, each of which contain copies of the original recombinant molecule.Cell culture is the complex process by which cells are grown under controlled conditions, outside their natural environment, an essential aspect of cloning technology.After 72h, we could detect green fluorescent protein in almost 90% of SUM52 cells.Fig1.Transfect GFP-plasmid into SUM52 with liposome2.We set up one SUM52-GFP stable cell line and treated

the centrifugal tube, empty from 1 min.9.We plan to put all sites and lines together into the PCR tube, so the free combination is performed on each sites and lines through complementary base pairing, forming all possible DNA fragments (i.e.In order to obtain a large number of target genes, all of the DNA fragments that start at the site 2 and end at the site 8 need to be amplified.Add 700 \u00b5l Buffer W2 to Spin Column, centrifuge at 12000\u00d7g for 30 seconds, then discard the filtrate.7.Add 500 \u00b5l Buffer W1 to Spin Column, centrifuge at 12000\u00d7g for 30 seconds, then discard the filtrate.6.Add 700 \u00b5l Buffer W2 into Spin Column, centrifuge at 12000\u00d7g for 30 seconds, then discard the filtrate.11.Add 500 \u00b5l Buffer W1 into Spin Column, centrifuge at 12000\u00d7g for 30 seconds, then discard the filtrate.10.Fill in the centrifugal pipe, centrifuge and discard repeatedly until the medium finished.Conduct the DNA Gel extraction of the DNA polymerization products (the protocol will be explained later)2.According to the amount and the concentration of gel, accurately weigh 0.75 g agarose powder and add in the conical flask.4.Add in 250\u00b5L Buffer S1 (dangling sample) and vortex until the precipitation disappears(a confirmation of having added RNase A in the Buffer S1).2.Cut out the desired DNA band (use UV lamp) and use paper towel to suck the liquid of gel surface.1.Therefore, the enzyme digestion is implemented simultaneously on target genes and plasmid for 2 hours(the enzyme digestion system is as shown in Table 6).Import the target genes into the plasmids, so under the same system, they connect for 12 hours( as shown in Table 7).Add the plasmid to competent cells, namely, the plasmid assembled with fragments of different bp are put into different tubes, with 50 competent cells each at room temperature for 20min.Annealing step: The low temperature allows annealing of the primers to the single-stranded DNA template and hybridization of the primer to the strand.?50? 30s? 3.According to the design of PCR primers, both ends of target genes contain the Pst I and EcoR I -HF enzyme sites, while the plasmid also contains this two enzyme sites.Heat the gel at 75?( the agarose gel with a low melting point can be heated at 45?).Extension step: The DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding Mg2+, dNTPs that are complementary to the template in 5  to 3  direction.Each take 200ml from the culture medium and put separately into four conical flask.3.Therefore, the DNA gel extraction is needed, by extracting directly from the solution instead of gel electrophoresis to reduce losses.1.Denaturation step: The high temperature causes DNA melting of the DNA template, yielding single-stranded DNA molecules.?98? 10s?2.Place Spin Column of the kits on the Collection Tube.8.Place Spin Column of the kits on the Collection Tube.4.Prepare 900ml liquid medium at first, according to the formula shown in Table 8.2.Shred the gel to speed up the step 6 of melting time, which improves the recovery rate of DNA.3.Weigh out the gel, calculate the volume.Carry out the calculation with 1 mg=1 L.4.Each cycle of the product can be used as a template for the next cycle, the number of DNA copies after a given n of cycles repeated is, 2n of cycles.1.Repeat the step 10 to get the products.Carry out the enzyme digestion operation after getting the target genes.Then carry out the gel electrophoresis and gel extraction of PCR products, respectively cut gel volume of 200 bp (150 bp and 200 bp are so close as to cut together), 250 bp and 350 bp (300 bp and 350 bp are so close as to cut together), then extract separately.1.Repeat the step 9 to get the products.According to our design, the starting point of all free combination pathways is site 2, the ending point is site 8.Preparation of 5 plates without chloramphenicol and 15 plates containing chloramphenicol (35 \u00b5g/ \u00b5L) tablet.After the multiplication of e. coli , we need to extract the plasmid in e. coli, the purification procedure is as follows:1.", "result": "The next is to weigh the three gels and put them into 3 recycling tubes to recycle.Also, in order to test the efficiency of enzyme digestion, DNA Gel Electrophoresis shall be conducted on the 3 pieces of DNA and the digested plasmids that have obtained through enzyme digestion and gel recycling, with 25ml of 3% gel.Owing to the small quantity, it is hard to be seen, the following part is the experiment of connecting the plasmids and pieces of different length of DNA, namely, inserting DNA pieces of different length into plasmids.(2)No E. coli grew on the Chl+ medium with Ecoli that linearized plasmids pSB1C3 were transformed into the Ecoli, which excludes the influence of the self-ligating of linearized plasmids (3) Two bacteria colonies were found in the Chl+ medium where Ecoli with plasmids of 200bp were imported.Here is the figure.From 150bp to 350bp, the 6 bands have all shown in the above picture, which proved the existence of DNA fragments of 200bp, 250bp and 350bp, namely, the existence of target genes.We then recycle the DNA bands of correspondent length?58?200bp, 250bp, 350bp? and conduct enzyme digestion on the recycled DNA fragments and plasmids pSB1C3 with Pst1 and EcoR1-HF under 37 ? respectively.Using the 6 pieces of different DNA fragments as templates, PCR is conducted by the site 2 and 8-specific primers and followed by gel electrophoresis to check if the target genes exist.The verification of recombinated plasmids proves the existence of target genes.After the verification of PCR and enzyme digestion, the corrected plasmids were delivered to the Nanjing genscript biotechnology co., LTD to do sequencing analysis.The results of the sequencing analysis reflected the paths and nodes information on the two DNA strands.In the picture of Electrophoresis of gel extraction, the bright band on the top are plasmids and target genes are in the bottom which were not obvious but visible and the bands are corrected.Then we extracting DNA from agarose gel, which means cutting out gel of correspondent length of DNA: The bright band of 200bp, 250bp and 350bp in correspondence with pieces of 200bp,250bp and 350bp respectively.(5) No Ecoli grow on the Chl+ medium where Ecoli with plasmids of 250bp were imported.Having observed the culture plates and got the expected results, the next step can be taken.Then single bacterial colony shall be picked out and monoclonal strains will be inoculated into LB liquid cultural medium to amplify and then get the recombinated plasmids.Extract plasmids using Axyprep Plasmid Miniprep Kit, followed by verification of the recombinated plasmids via enzyme digestion and PCR, and at last, sequencing of the correct recombinated plasmids will be performed.(4) Three bacteria colonies were found in the Chl+ medium where Ecoli with plasmids of 350bp were imported.The following are the pictures:During PCR verification, 5 expected bands in corresponding lengths are seen, which means that target genes have already been inserted into the plasmids.The results turned out to meet our expectations:(1)No E. coli grew on the Chl+ medium with Ecoli that no plasmids were transformed into it.After transforming the path lengths to decimal digits and calculating, we get the actual path lengths of the two respectively: 28mile for <2-4-8> and 26mile for <2-6-8>.We will pick out the single bacterial colony on the solid cultural medium(two bacterial colonies that were on medium with 200bp will be labeled 200bp1, 200bp2, three bacterial colonies that were on medium with 350bp will be labeled 350bp1, 350bp2, 350bp3).(3% gel, 30ml) Because of the small quantity, lane 1?2?3 are hard to be found through eyes, however, they do exist as correspondence to bands of specific length.It can be seen that the two paths are <2-4-8> and <2-6-8>.", "safety": "", "keywords": "expression StarScaffold scientifically aeruginosa Investigator unsuccessful BIO-COMPASS autotrophic problematic inductions ", "track":

was responsible for monitoring the work of team in multiple aspects including experiment operating, human practices conducting, wiki designing, and so on.People who participated in the survey learn about synthetic biology and would like to join in iGEM next times.He have given valuable suggestions on mathematical modeling and kept reminding the team for the important criteria that IGEM awarding requires.Chenghao was in charge of major designs of promotional materials, including making posters, banners, videos and PPT etc., anything about propagating our project both in giant jamboree and human practice.Hello, I\u0092 m Jiongjian Li, a third year student major in Biology of XJTLU.For me, the iGEM competition is a big opportunity for me to make a breakthrough of myself.3 teammates are preparing the main presentation and another 2 will be in charge of the human practice presentation.Everyone in our team has devoted a lot during the summer and sponsors helped us a lot.Through iGEM, my knowledge of synthetic biology was greatly enriched and I learnt valuable skills in this field.At the beginning of iGEM project, the company offered us a training program including both theoretical basis of synthesis biology and practical skills useful in later wet experiments.It is a great honor to take part in this competition where I learned a lot about synthetic biology and made lots of new friends.Hello, everyone!I am sure iGEM is the most exciting and challenging competition I\u0092ve ever experienced.In this amazing team, I really enjoy the time spent with other team members during our project.Before this competition, he had told us how to work in a team and do scientific research.As a team member, conducting experiments is my major task in which caution and preciseness keep in my mind all the time.I\u0092m Xinhao Wang and that\u0092s my first year in XJTLU iGEM Team.IGEM is a great experience for us science students to combine our ideas and practical lab work.During the participation of this project, I learn much more knowledge than that from books, and many skills such as literature reviewing skills and experimental skills are quickly improved.He is also responsible for the uniform designing, the pictures of the poster.Ziang is responsible for constructing wiki webpages as a programmer.iGEM is a fantastic and challengeable competition, I feel really excited and pleased to participate in it.My work in our iGEM team is dealing with finanicial affairs as well as conducting some experiments.It is not only about a great deal of new knowledge, technique and experience I can get from the experiment.This is my first year to join iGEM and it is a great honor to join this competition.During this project, I learn knowledge in synthetic biology and it gives me experience of designing and conducting an experiment.She also participated in the molecular cloning experiment during that time.17 teammates have registered the competition in the early summer and 9 of them will attend the Giant Jamboree.We have designed an amazing wiki website to show our results.I am Yinsiyi.Wang, a photographer in XJTLU-CHIAN iGEM team.In addition, he also modified photos and pictures to beautify our wiki.Hao participated in the research & design of the ribotherometers and the second phase of our experiments (from July to September).He also worked as wiki webpages art design with the help of Gandi.Zixu designed the original pathway of our project together with Gandi.In addition, it is a memorable experience to work with friends for the same goal.Meanwhile, he did some lab work and wrote something that we put on our wiki.She helped doing the lab work, mainly in the experiments of picking and testing the function of ribothermometer during July and August.Here I appreciate all team members in XJTLU-CHINA iGEM team.The iGEM is a worldwide competition and joining this not only broadens my horizons and improves my knowledge but also meets new friends and strengthens our friendship.I\u0092m Yakun Tang and I\u0092m a year 3 student in Biological Science department of XJTLU.I would like to learn how to work in a team and make true friends.He also did the work of sponsors contacting, safety form submitting and parts registration.Yakun participated in and conducted the lab work during June, July and August.Everyone in our team has a great experience during months.Thus, I am responsible for the experiment parts.He also helped us evaluate the feasibility of our map design and gave us experiment room to do our project.Dechang Xu joined us in early July 2015 as a project advisor.Jioning in the iGEM is to make more interesting friends.Hence, I deal with these issues and encourage you to carry out the project.It aims to provide customers with a perfect technical platform of the synthesis biology.Before iGEM, I also had internships in other institutes.As an instructor of XJTLU-CHINA iGEM team, he believed we were able to perform well in their lab work and outside activities.He did part of the work of human practices also i.g.I really enjoy the work during the project.I join in the XJTLU-CHINA team as lab instructor and sponsor.She participated in the lab work throughout this summer (From June to September) and was involved in designing the experiments for determining the degradation rate of chromoproteins and the validity of RNA thermometers (From June to September).I think iGEM is a good opportunity for students to study synthetic biology together and communicate with students from different universities.It is my pleasure for non-biology student to join iGEM team.This year I participate in XJTLU-CHINA iGEM team.Hi, I am Yuwei, a year four student in XJTLU biological science.They thanked us a lot and we were also proud of supporting other groups in iGEM competition.As a young undergraduate, iGEM provides a valuable opportunity to practice our skills and learn extra knowledge in a short period time.That is what I do in this team.He also helped to conduct human practice, designed the questionnaires and modified the wiki.Tian\u0092ge did plenty literature research on genetic regulatory parts and have gave valuable suggestions regarding the problems we meet in wet experiment.No matter how many rewards or how much honor I achieved, I might be your student in iGEM competition.In June, he always participated in discussion and wrote an iGEM procedure in order to achieve further funding from a synbio company.During the designing and conducting of our project, our attitude of doing science is becoming more careful and thorough.I am very interested in iGEM competition and would like to support their experiment with funding and technology.I believe it would be one of the most extraordinary things happened in my year 3 biology study.The team achieved permit and funding from university after the speech.I am responsible for writing our wiki and supporting lab group in our team.Moreover, it gives me a chance to actually participate in the generation of an innovation, from the development of a new idea to finally give rise to the final production of an item.I know that the team experienced a difficult time due to permit and sponsor.When there is a chance to make an effort on a self-designed experiment, everything taught in lectures becomes vivid and the discoveries made before just sound more exciting.Considered taking the advantage of my computer skills, I am responsible for team poster, brief video production and wiki page beautification.In May, in an iGEM public speech he talked about a project about synthesis of crispr-cas system in gliomas cell to specifically knock out CD44 gene for inhibiting cell migration and activation.Also, I am willing to work with other teammates to achieve our goals.He also participated in the molecular cloning experiments in August and September.involving sound chip-based gene synthesis and high throughput gene sequencing service, it already develops the technology of constructing recombinant antibody libraries as well as highly-purified vaccines, genome synthesis and DNA storage.As a major sponsor of XJTLU-China 2015, they provided a lab equipped with all apparatuses and reagents needed and directly which gave a hand in the de novo gene synthesis in the circuits\u0092 construction.Hi I\u0092m Tiange Li (Mag) and this is my first tour of iGEM.It is lucky to be here, iGEM.Synbio Tech is an innovator in the field of synthetic biology in China, having a wide range of cooperation with both international companies and universities.I believe that there is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.I\u0092m Zhe Yang and third year biological student of Xi\u0092an Jiaotong Liverpool University.I am proud to participate in iGEM competition this summer.I like painting, as a result, I reasonably became a member of wiki team.This is my first time to know iGEM competition and lead a 15-member-team.So for me, this project is like a gate which leads to a magic biology world.Both of these two need patience and carefulness, but as a smart girl^0^, I will try my best!Hello, everyone!There was a story that I known this competition from my internship supervisor in March and I began to study synthetic biology.He also designed and operated the experiment of the \"constitutive promoter + tet operator \"system.Hello, I am Yacheng and you can also call me \u0091Er Ye\u0092.iGEM is a gate for me to formally enter in research field.This is the first time I participate in iGEM.Certainly we will show their great attributions on our wiki.We did survey about iGEM, synbio, biosafety, global warming, and GMO.After a hot summer, I am very proud to these smart and hard-working teenagers.She also participated in designing and testing part of Ribothermometers and recorded this part of experiment on our notebook in detail during July, 2015.Wenbo was in authority of circuits design.But, at this time I will cooperate with my teammates and solve difficult problems in any aspects of our project.And I\u0092m studying computer science in Xi\u0092an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.Moreover, he took part in the meet up at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum.I really enjoy the time spending with them, sharing information and taking a walk from the lab.Up to now what I\u0092ve done most are literature review, I fresh myself when reading research articles.", "background": "", "description": "This year, team of XJTLU aims to simulate the process of global warming by introducing ribothermometers and chromoproteins to Escherichia coli.", "design": "", "human_practice": "Participating members: Team members in XJTLU-CHINA, staffs in the department of biology, students interested in synbio and iGEM.Purpose of this event: we hope more people could be involved in the iGEM competition and develop an interest in synthetic biology.Also, 16 people were not sure that they had a clear idea about synthetic biology.If people chose \u0091B\u0092 and \u0091C\u0092, the definition of synthetic biology would be displayed.Results are that over a half of people considered that the situation of global warming was quite serious and almost half of people felt that climate is changing currently.Additionally, we found that they were also willing to search synthetic biology on internet and wanted to learn more about this novel field>Provided definition: Synthetic biology is the design and construction of biological devices and systems for useful purposes.Over a half of people did not know about synthetic biology before.We asked reasons for climate change, the majority of people thought we destoryed the environment and a few people considered it was the automatical process of on Earth s development.Question 7Which behavior do you think will intensify the greenhouse effect???????????????????According to the result, industrial pollution is considered as the most serious issue on environmnet as well as the most significant reason of the climate change.Hence, we asked people this question to find if they knew the application of synthetic biology.However, more and more people concern about the safety of genetically modified food, though some authentic organization such as FDA or WHO announced GM foods are absolutely safe.Question 5What do you think is the current situation of global climate??????????????????We wanted to find Chinese people\u0092 views on climate change.Many of the attendees have no background in biology, thereby we used the simplest way to introduce synthetic biology and show our project.Therefore, we can know Chinese people still care about the climate and had similar view that climate is changing currently.Question 6Which of the following item do you think is the main cause of greenhouse effect???????????????????Also, people thought that the reducing vegetation and the destruction of eco-environment caused global warming.This question is aimed to find whether synthetic biology is well-known in China or not and let more people know about this field.Particularly, the majority of people chose oil because they know biofuels are being used.However, some people chose GM foods because the foods were cheap and no organic food was available.However, only a few people knew that synthetic biology could be applied in metallurgic industries as well.Question 3Have you ever heard about bio-safety before?Also, by holding this event, XJTLU-CHINA want to strengthen the collaboration between university and gain further sponsorship or policy permission.Jodie, as the team leader, started the presentation and introduced synthetic biology to the attendees.In conclusion, we thought Chinese people could distinguish some common GMOs, however some they could not.A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.Question 4Some people consider that modern biotechnologies including synthetic biotechnology may cause problem in safety of human society.We thought that many people in China did not accept biotechnology, they worry that it would be harmful to their heath.NYU-Shanghai did a fantastic project; their work not only limited to synthetic biology but also involved applying knowledge and technologies from multiple subjects including electrical engineering, computer science and VR.During the workshop, we explained thorough detail of our project to many visitors including a museum staff who presented all projects on the museum website for online visitors.We wanted to find out if people knew about bio-safety and we hoped that they could pay attention to bio-safety after this survey.Additionally, a few people thought that GM food could be preserved in longer time and had other better properties.Therefore, the color of world map will be changed as well, which could mimic the process of global warming.Result was that less than a half of people have heard about bio-safety before and over a half of people did not consider about safe problem.This task aimed to let more people in different fields to synthetic biology and iGEM.We wanted to find Chinese people\u0092s views on GM foods, thus we ask them question 5, 6, 7 and 8.Question 10Which foods do you think are genetically modified?While, less than half of people considered that cherry tomato, which means many people still did not it is genetically modified.This was the first time staffs in biology department are introduced to iGEM and its importance.Next in the public speech was the introduction of several projects in the previous iGEM competition.Result was that 32.5% of people agreed that synthetic biotechnology may cause safe problems.Synthetic biology was explained as the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems and the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes.It is really cool!\u0094After talking with other iGEM teams, we were surprised by their work during the summer.Please choose one or more.?????????????????????Most of people thought that GM foods had good looking so they choose them.We found that people would like to enjoy green lifestyle such as riding bicycle, but they need more guide lines.Question 9Is it safe or not to display the process of global warming on our biothermomap?Unfortunately, we had enough team members so that we encouraged them to participate in the 2016 iGEM competition instead.If so, your bacterial map will be closer to the real world.\u0094A lady from China-Tongji said: \u0093It is a great idea to let the bacteria change their color automatically in order to stimulate the process of global warming.Result was that most of people considered that conventional industries such as agriculture, cottonocracy and oil industry may be replaced by bio-synthesis.During workshop, we were surprised to find that a little child was able to participate in the NYU-Shanghai exhibition.Although the projects were replaced by another better idea, we still gained a lot from group discussions and research training.After this public speech, many biology students strongly wanted to join our team.Nonetheless, there were 60% of people are not sure that if GM foods is safe or not.She also talked about iGEM, the main process during the competition, and modern biological technologies used in iGEM.We were surprised found that over a half of people were not sure they ate GM foods.?????????????????????????????Two thirds of people thought our project is safe, while the rest of them were worried about safety issue.They did not view the urbanization and garbage were the main reasons.Question 8Do you pay attention to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and promote low carbon life in your daily life??????????????????????????????CO2 is a type of warming gases, its uncontrolled emissions may result in climate change.He thought it could be used as drug to regulate gene expression; however he doubted that whether it could be used for the translation of proteins.ZJU-China team made a funny biological playing card; this board game could help student learn much about synthetic biology.Hence, we ask people this question to find their opinions about biotechnologies.The poster also illustrated two creative ideas; one was using RNA thermometers controlling the translation of chrome-proteins, another was the constructing of genetic circuit which made protein expression ordered.We advised them to make the board game easier to understand and design it with information that is more detailed so that public could accept it rather than biology students only.Lv agreed and would like to help us with the project.????????????????We found that about 44% of people had bought and eaten the GM foods while only 4 people clearly knew that they never bought or ate any GM foods.Particularly, only a few people thought the potato with smooth surface as GMO, but most of people did not know.One of the most important tasks in iGEM competition is human practice.Therefore, we provided some information about biosafety after they answered this question; they could learn and start to think about bio-safe problem.Nonetheless, some people worrys that biotechnologies may cause ethic or safe problem in human society.?????????????????????As we known, synthetic biology can be applied in many area and even replace some conventional industries.He was very drawn to the ribosome meter and predicted that this technology would have a huge application.We considered that most of people did not have biological background.We prepared a poster about iGEM and our project, as well as a video to show the XJTLU-CHINA iGEM team and Xi`an Jiaotong-Liverpool university.The poster showed the topic and proposals of our project.Furthermore, we started to cooperate with them after the workshop.It encompasses a variety of different approaches, methodologies, and disciplines with a focus on engineering biology and biotechnology.Question 2Which conventional industries will be replaced by synthetic biology?We should do more work to ensure the safety of biotechnology so that more people will trust it.Particularly, there was nobody thinking that the climate is as same as many years ago.We thought more scientific research should be conducted to prove this issue.Question 14Do you think the catastrophes caused by uncontrolled bio-technology in some films will happen in the real world?Also, many people were curious about GMOs and never saw them before.Many people thought they were delicious and contains additional nutrition.Please choose the disasters which you believe that may come true.??????????????????????????????????????????????According to our experiment, RNA thermometer will form a loop on mRNA to inhibit protein translation, while the loop could open if temperature increases so that ribosome can pass the loop and produce peptides.T^TFortunately, the loop disappears because of increasing temperature so that I can pass this typical sequence to restart my work.I walk alone the mRNA sequence, translate every codon to amino acid, and connect them to peptide by dehydration.However, over one third people were not sure that if it had positive effect or negative effect.China-Tongji iGEM team tried to make nematodes light-sensitive, which we thought was an amazing project.Provided information: Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health.Giving education to next generation may be the best way to resolve the issue of global warming.We aim to use LEGO robot to present how the RNA thermometer work in E coli.Dr. Meng said that he was amazed by those work that done by undergraduate students and some projects were exceed his exception.The final part was the most important section, the announcement for our own projects.This can directly encourage people to feel the influence of global warming.Question 1Have you ever heard about synthetic biology before this survey???????????????????????iGEM competition is an annual, world wide, synthetic biology event.While, 28.75% of people considered it was absolutely safe.They in turn, also gave us many useful suggestions on completing our project and improving parts quality.This participant from USTC said: \u0093First, I consider that your ideas are amazing!According to this result, only a quarter of people heard about bio-synthesis before our survey.The project involves the use of various colored E. coli to draw a world map; they in turn could change their color with an increase in temperature.", "modeling": "Hence,in which Ae was external AHL concentration and Am was internal concentration of AHL in marine cells.We assumed that, for the location of coast and polar cells, external AHL concentration was consistent with Ae.Hence, we may model the production rate of AHL by,The background noise production rate is donated as kd and ka is the AHL production rates due to the initiation process.Compared to the timescales of interest, cell division time, these internal biochemical reactions occur very quickly, and it is reasonable to assume that equation (A.1) is in equilibrium (mathematically, it means dL/dt =0).Hence, The production of chromoproteins depend on both the concentration of AHL (A) and growing stage.The Hill function provides cooperative switching from the synthesis-off to the synthesis-on states, via two parameters a and m,Those two cooperative switch function gave the insight of the producing rate of different chromoproteins in polar and coast constructs.1.Colton DM, Stabb EV, Hagen SJ (2015)  Modeling Analysis of Signal Sensitivity and Specificity by Vibrio fischeri LuxR Variants , PLoS ONE., 10(5): e0126474.The synthesis of AHLs by  marine  bacteria involves the transcription of certain genes when the secondary structure of RNA thermometers was melted and then output Lux I promotes AHL production by catalyzing the reaction of the two AHL precursor molecules, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and hexanoyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein).The cloud-like icon stands for two substrates that produces the AHL, the wavy lines represent transcription of the protein and the \u0093*\u0094 represent degradation.We further assumed that the concentrations of SAM and, C6-ACP are at a constant levels S0 and C0, respectively.Noted that ?L was not the natural decay rate, the degradation of LuxI was accelerated by introducing LVA tail in marine cells.Combining the result with (A.2) givesWhen  Polar  and  Coastal  cells were initiated by the diffusion of AHLs, they would start to produce chromoproteins.The first aim of our modeling is to estimate the production rate (?m) of AHL in marine cells.The reactions in the dashed box which occur only in the marine cells and other reactions happen in polar and coastal cells.Where S, C6, A and M are SAM, hexanoyl-ACP, 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and the waste product, respectively.In marine construct, output of Lux I occurs at a constant rate L0 as indicated in Figure 1 and decays at a rate of ?L.Thus, the second attempt of this modeling practice was to investigate the initiation status in polar and coast cells.We introduced the factor ?=??A/Vc based on the work of Garcia-Ojalvo (2003) and ETH-Zurich 2013 igem project (2013), with ? representing the membrane permeability, A is surface area and Vc is the cell volume, and ?ext=?/Vext with Vext being the total extracellular volume.", "notebook": "According to the preliminary experimental planning, the gene sequence was compiled.Later in May, we also held an iGEM public speech in our university, both professors and students were involved, to get a better understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM.This was the start of our summer vacation and we started our work in lab, although this week was just for practicing experiment skills.Several experiment protocols were settled with the preliminary experimental design.Even though we just managed to have the registration done and were very excited to become an iGEMer for the first time.One is \u0091bacteria death

team members as a supervisor.Escherichia coli, as an engineering bacterium, is the cell line that we normally work with.We are obligatory on improving the understanding of the importance of biosafety and in order to change the situation in a large scale, we are hereby looking forward to the assistance of Chinese government.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?Moreover, we followed the rules and firmly believe that the safety is always priority to our project.Our project is only a demonstrated project and is not involved in any direct contact between the bacteria and the public.Even if there are experimental bacteria accidentally entering natural environment, they are highly unlikely to pose a threat given the overloaded bacteria and the harmless nature of themselves.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?No.Fortunately, in our lab, there is a strict safety assessment procedure devised by the lab managers and which is fully capable of ensuring the safety of the researchers.the biothermomap may only use for non-commercial and non-profit purpose and the bacteria would not be spread out and used by other institutions, except in our lab.No.The only difference is that integrating various protein genes into one construction forms a relatively complicated bacteria internal environment, which is inclined to weaken the cells.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?We wouldn\u0092t dare to affirm that Chinese government completely neglects the biosafety issue but can tell that the economic benefits always outweigh the costs on the biosafety in the view of a vast majority of proprietors.All BioBrick parts were derived from the previous iGEM team or the literature and which all had been expressed in E. coli previously and no hazardous conclusion was drawn.Different groups may look at biosafety problems from completely different perspectives, which is conducive to discovering the risks on the early stage.For instance, \u0093having a good mood\u0094 is documented as the top one because keeping your mind clean, clear, positive and free is usually a good way to ensure the correctness and safety of experiments.Being responsible to everyone, 2015 XJTLU team took variety of measurements to promote the safety in the lab.An approach is to establish a risk assessment section in our Wiki page to allow diverse groups to comment and point out the potential risks.The key is the visual effect caused by the microbes instead of the products of bacteria or bacteria itself.To be honest, there is NO any biosafety-related group, committee, or review board at our institution.But most of the biohazards are foreseeable and predictable.", "keywords": "Presentation Lethbridge Fundraising lignin-degrading co-activator experience competition University experiments biodigesters ", "track":

need to concern about environment, give a whole impression and do simulation to clarify the goals.When \"designing\" biomolecules or biological systems, we should take into account the use of artistic activities to make our project easier to understand to the general public.Because there is no clear boundary, it is hard to find clear answer of ethic problems such as genetically modification.Furthermore, these activities were good opportunities to learn how our project can impact the general public.The detail of each school visit is organized on our wiki, so you can use it as a reference if you come to get involved in this kind of activity.There is not only one story for SnowWhite, but there exist several ones.We designed a circuit in orderto recreate the story using ourown parts!Does no other character apart from Snow White, the Prince and the Queen appear?It is interesting to recreate the story of Snow White, but is there a way to apply Tokyo_Tech\u0092s project into medicine or agriculture?Could we use the TA system for any contribution to society?\u0093I was surprised to see how you can use E. coli to make this kind of playful experiments!\u0094It changed my impression that E. coli equals food poison, and now I fell some kind of respect for it.We usually hear the term gene recombination, but never how it\u0092s done.However, thinking about the ethic directly is difficult, so at the first step, we want to think about ethic related to what kind of problems in our project.As what we said in Future work, we are thinking that whether TA system can be applied to DDS and to decreasing risk of mutidrug-resistant bacteria appearing .Moreover, we start to think about our ethic code of synthetic biology, basing on the things we learned from this symposium.We discussed with 6 researchers who is working on synthetic biology in this symposium.We thought about the danger of synthetic biology to our human being so far, on the other hand, we also need to take account into the creature used in experiments.At the beginning of our iGEM activities, we felt that people seem to be unfamiliar with synthetic biology and its social contribution.Our project includes a basic research, so, we thought that we should work on our project in terms of economy, instead of more specific fields such as environment and medicine, to make our project flexible to the upcoming technology.Since we found our activities are influential to many people, we want to continue these to inform the utility of synthetic biology to the public even after iGEM.We are using E. coli in our project this time.when we actually did the experiment, E. coli is systematically different with human being, so we hard to have a sense of guilty even though we make them work to meet our own needs.Therefore, from the view point of economy, we set a goal to control protein production.After this dialogue, we have done two things to implement the protein production control.The development of a software which adjusts the number of ACA (Adenine-Cytosine-Adenine) sequence in the DNA.The experiments of creating E. coli mutants which secrete protein extracellularlyThese resulted in big success to obtain protein production control.Moreover, we had a dialogue with Prof. Nakasaki about the application of the technology of TA system.In other words, we could design an oscillatory cell-cell communication in which one cell containing man system, receives an extrinsic signal (Maz system is controlled by the type of the signal), then the cell produces the substance which affects other cells.To increase the selectivity of repressing the protein production by Maz system, we develop a tool of increasing or decreasing the number of ACA sequence named \"ACA Dwarfs.\"Specially, since cooperation between wet and dry teams is important, we need to share information daily and never fail to communicate in order to improve the understanding of each other.Compared to the analytic approach, the synthetic approach has to take in consideration more topics including technology and ethic.We have interests in this thing , so when we think about ethic code, we make it based on this.Firstly, the reason why the ethic of technology and the one of science are different is because the goals of studies are different.Then we learned that which one should be deal with between ethics of technology and ethics of science is decided by the thing that between developing technology and scientific research, which field your study is most likely to belong to.What can we do by modifying the genes of E. coli?The public will not understand our project unless they experience it.We noticed that the ways of manifesting and expressing our project are important when we explain our project to the public.He gave us the advice that we should insert a punch line in our project to summarize our project to the audience s satisfaction.I\u0092d like to try it too.We included the opinion of the students in our card game and improved it!What kind of lecture should we perform in order to let students understand better the gene recombination technics.As a result of incorporating what we learn after talking to the science communicator in our lectures... we obtained even better results!One of his research aims to produce chemical materials efficiently such as L-lactone and ethanol that is biodegradable plastic materials.He showed interest in the fact that TA system inhibits the cell growth of E. coli and can even \"resuscitate\" it.During the dialogue, we were given with the positive option that continuously repeating the control of protein production can lead to a technology which reduces the risk of the appearance of multiple-drug-resistant bacteria.when we were giving the lecture to high school students, we know something new through the conversation among ordinary people, which is different when we talk with scientists.So we could apply this oscillatory system to DDS (Drug Delivery System) or to decrease the risk of the appearance of the multi-drug-resistant strains.This oscillatory model can decrease the possibility of the appearance of the multidrug-resistant strains because the pesticide is produced at intervals.Introducing maz system to human cells and orchestrating the human original signal transduction system and Maz system, we design the mechanism that the cell secrets drug depended on the internal condition.To improve the performance of controlling the production by Maz system, we developed a tool for increasing or decreasing the number of ACA sequence, which is the specific site cleaved by MazF homo dimmer.So, it will contribute to the society to clarify the mechanism of intestinal flora and to find a way of controlling it.Our project focused on the cell-cell communication through TA system and QS, and proved the initial step to explain and control the system of the intestinal symbiosis.We should respect every life and be grateful to every life utilized in experiment.We should concern about the influences on life environment of utilized sample and testee.We should be aware of our position as a researcher and never utilize any specimens escaping from the law in gene modification experiments and etc; and we should never perform any fraud of experimental results, unauthorized reproduction or any other kind of plagiarism that would put in doubt one\u0092s dignity.We should always respect the others  position, and try our best to make up for deficiency mutually like in the Asilomar Conferences.In this case, we organized a symposium where we can discuss with the experts and exchange opinions with them.On the other hand, as reality, ordinary people tend to think towards questions that it is scientist who should take into account theses problems, and have nothing to do with the problems.In order to solve these issues, we chose to show our concepts through Snow White, one of the most famous stories around the world.\"These are words that the public told us about our activities, which means that the public did not understand our activity well.But spreading a pesticide one by one costs money, so we suggest using the system of controlling the protein production a by Maz system: the production of a pesticide is usually repressed by MazF, but only when the substance delivered from the targeted organism (for example: pheromone), MazF is contradicted by MazE and the pesticide is produced.We aim to make our project be applied to developing technology which is usable to society, therefore, we think about our ethic code referencing the ethic of technology.For example, when a maz system introduced cell receives the blood glucose level increase, the cell synthesizes the insulin.Our TA systems and QS might be applicable to control the Intestinal FloraThese days, Intestinal Flora draws a lot of attention because it will greatly affect our health.These lead to technological development in the future, so the details on them are shown on Future work.We consider the possibility of the protein production system is controlled by Maz system and signal transfer mechanism.All the things above are the reason making ethic problems become complicated.The goal of debeloping technology is mainly application in the society, as a result, it is necessary to include appropriateness of method, usability, security and management of risk.The subjects for the dialogue were mainly DDS (Drug Delivery System) and risk reduction of the multi-drug-resistant bacteria emergence.Education plays an important role to raise scientific literacy as one of the most fundamental activities in daily life.Although through this people will get profit, the other creatures will be faced with new dangers.We should not only talk about the results but also convince the audience through our explanation.This dialogue was the biggest turning point of our project.Prof.However, how about the other creatures?And also in the protein expression that comes with this mechanism.The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces.If the balance of intestinal flora is lost, it will lead into an illness or might even change your personality.Additionally, research institutes are focus on the construction whether it can leak genetically modified organism or not.We contributed to raising public awareness of synthetic biology and improving our project through science communication.We approach the social meaning of our project from three aspects: Education, Ethics, and Economy.And the utility of E. coli which will extinct even without being dealed with to become weak under the dry condition.In order to change the way they are thinking, it is important to have the opportunities that we can get information from scientists in symposium and lectures given to high school students.On the other hand, researcher do the scientific studies due to the spirit of inquiry, therefore, it is necessary to include appropriateness and completely mutual criticism among researchers.Maz system.Combining i. and ii., it is expected that the target protein is obtained effectively and with favorite rate.However, the solution to the leak of genetically modified organism are being developed.Hence, we should construct the whole concept, thinking what listeners will think after explanation about our project.Japan: Seimeikinounokozotekikenkyunogenzyotosya?kaitekikadai?nihonniokerugouseiseibutsugakutoha?(Present state and social problems on structural research of life
