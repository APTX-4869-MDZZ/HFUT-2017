polycistronic B genes whose first gene codes for the LacI repressor.In daytime, polycistronic A genes will not be expressed, there will be no CI repressor to prevent the transcription of the polycistronic B genes.Thus, butyrate will be produced and the LacI repressor will repress the polycistronic A genes.The phosphoryl group will be subsequently transfered to the transcription factor OmpR, which then, will upregulate genes expressed from the POmpC promoter .In contrast, with light, PCB prevents the Cph8 autophosphorylation.OmpR will not be activated and the genes under POmpC will not be expressed.This circadian switch is further improved by integrating a NOT logic gate into the regulation circuitry.This is achieved using the phage lambda cI repressor (BBa_K1587006) as well as the bacterial LacI repressor.The genetic system has been designed to be switched on and off in response to light [2].Whitout light, Cph8 autophosphorylates its EnvZ intracellular domain while

a proper diffusion of our molecules, see more in \"Modeling\" part.The 3D printer used to construct our trap and the result of 3D printing: TrApiColiThe use of genetically modified organisms in a field associated with edible products requires to carefully consider the issues of safety, national legislation, and public opinion.In this context, we looked for a solution that would isolate our engineered bacteria from the environment, while still allowing its growth and gas diffusion.We found the solution in the iGEM Groeningen 2012 project that used a special polymer called TPX\u00ae in order to keep their bacteria from contaminating meat, their edible product.TPX\u00ae is composed of Polymethylpentene, a porous polymer, and is commercialized by the company MitsuiChemicals (4-methylpentene-1 based polyolefin, Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.).Thus, the trap was designed to be placed at the entrance of the hive, in order to act before infection and try to prevent the entry of as many mites as possible.The bees usually enter the hive by landing on the bottom board before walking inside.As in the Groeningen 2012 project, our bacteria need to be separated from the growth medium until the beekeeper decides to use the trap.Thanks to that, the trap can be easily and perfectly installed on the hive by the beekeepers without drilling or cutting.The trap was designed using Catia and then 3D printed in order to build a prototype.In order to get the best out of ApiColi in the treatment of varroosis, we designed a trap named TrApiColi.This trap could not be tested without coating because the porous plastic used for 3D printing is permeable to liquids and gases.Because of the alignment of the trap with the board, it will not disturb the bees  comings and goings.TrApiColi was thought up to take into account ethical reflection, safety and ease of use for beekeepers.Since the switch between the production of the two molecules is regulated by light, our bacteria need to be outside of the beehive.in microaerobic conditions, without agitation and miming batch culture condition), as it would be in the fieldGas diffusion tests: Permeability of butyric

with it.Some of them weren t aware that banana had DNA at all and some teachers told us that our demonstration was very well designed and easy to understand without distorting the truth.The stand having drawn everybody\u0092s attention (thanks to the pungent smell of smashed bananas), our intervention was broadcasted on a local TV (TLT[1]), and we were also selected to take part in International ExpoSciences in Brussels.To carry on with our education mission, we agreed with one of the science teachers from the Leonard de Vinci junior high school of Tournefeuille to meet with the students.On the other hand it is also crucial to make sure that our molecules do not have a negative impact on the bees.Early on in the project, we thought about how best to address the biocontainment issue regarding our bacterial system.Most of the children were not antagonized to the use of a modified bacterium as long as it was confined in our Trapicoli, but we felt that the biological knowledge needed to fully understand synthetic biology was a little foreign to them, so we switched our lecture to focusDuring the Q and A, we were asked about our studies and the kind of diploma we had.In these societies, living beings are held to be untouchable, it is thus necessary to comprehensively explain what synthetic biology is, what our project is, as well as what experiments we are conducting in the lab in order to give clues and keys to people having no background in this field so that we can start to have a discussion with them.It actually seems that we do not have the power to control them entirely, we can only act on a few metabolic pathways, a few functions, at the same time.When discussing the different concepts and approaches of synthetic biology, we have to take into account that ethical reflections depend on the core values of a society and thus differ from one to the other.But, as it was not in our aim to use their research to commercialize an attractive solution of Varroa destructor, we decided to base our research attractive module on the result of this US patent.We had to use a DNA construction designed by Dr Christopher Voigt from Voigt Labs, MIT.You can learn more about this in the video below.Apart from this physical containment, we were also thinking of adding to our system an auxotrophy to a specific nutriment not found in the natural environment.INSA Toulouse is a public school for engineers thus the biosafety guidelines are not specific to our institution; the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms are applied.The regulation on workers  protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No.Christianity having been predominant historically in Western Europe, it still has an influence on people\u0092s minds and a notion that could be assimilated to sin still clings to the modification of organisms.We can then ask ourselves the following questions: is it possible to have control over organisms, and if yes, to which extent?In fact, the trap we designed is in itself a first barrier, preventing the engineered bacteria from being in contact with their environment (and particularly the bees).Indeed it is often easier to trust someone when the doubts are clearly stated than when everything is allegedly under control but it cannot be verified.Before we can have any kind of ethical reflection concerning our project, we asked ourselves how to best define our \u0093work material\u0094, meaning living beings.But since regulations are different around the world, and to have a complete overview of our project, we decided to reflect on the biosafety issue, if our device were to be put in place on hives.Given that DNA is our main work tool, we decided to engage the children by letting them extract DNA from bananas, with ethanol and dishwashing soap.Add the 50ml of water(must be at ambient temperature), the salt and the Dishwashing soapIn the alcohol layer, a white cloud with bubbles should appear, this cloud is DNA!This simple yet interesting experience helped us attract children to our stand.But when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the general public and the environment.This is why we focused a big part of our energy on communicating with the public, in order to raise awareness about a worrying situation.In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures.As new interns we had to take part in a general training session to learn how to identify the risks and preventourselves and our colleagues from harm.It also informs the employee about the emergency numbers.The second one is a training about the techniques used during our stay concerning microbiological, chemical and incendiary risks.We then have a test to make sure that we were understood and aware of the previous presentations.This is the way in which one will be able to identify the barriers and the fears of the public, and understanding them is the first step to conquer them.Our project took place in a research context.In order to discuss our project with people having a first hand experience of the problem, we joined this forum.Indeed a symbiosis between man and specific bacteria is essential to its survival, and we can wonder what the impact of the modification of bacteria interacting (closely or not) with human beings will be.Anthropocentrism, which places human beings above everything and particularly above nature, is the utilitarian vision.When we first started to reach out to the public we realised that the issue of the decline in bee population was a well-known issue.That\u0092s why we met with a beekeeper (who was also a microbiologist) to discuss our project and the material restrictions we should submit to.Finally, one issue specific to our project is the fact that the small bag containing bacteria would probably have to be manipulated by beekeepers.Hence, a MTA agreement has been filled with Dr Clark Lagarias from UCDavis, so that we could obtain the strain containing the cyanobacterian light sensors from Dr Nico Claassens, Wageningen University in Netherlands.During the summer, our lab was in the engineering school INSA which possesses a safety department with one prevention advisor and several prevention assistants assigned to the laboratories.As mentioned before, ethics was a dimension that was present from the very first stages of the development of our project.Often being questioned about the fact that \u0093researchers play God by modifying living beings\u0094, and the prevailing societal distrust, we naturally developed a reflection about the possible limits to give to our project.Formerly, the field of biology matched its greek definition: bios meaning life and logos, study, biology was indeed the study of life and living beings.Finally we took the opportunity of being in Belgium to organize a quick meetup with the KU Leuven iGEM team.Overall this experience in Brussels was quite intense, we met many people interested in science and it was refreshing to be able to get out of the lab and interact with people about our project.Nevertheless the loss of a bacterial colony does not affect us emotionally in the same way the loss of a swarm does.But iGEM does not stop on the 28th of September, and we have everything planned to keep our education project alive after the competition:The \"Student s week\" occuring in several towns in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region facilitatesthe integration of new students in Toulouse by allowing them to participate in free events organized by diverseTaking place in Toulouse, Scientilivre (\"Science book\") is very rightly named and is there to present both books and scienceto the public.At the very beginning of the project, we were not at all specialists of the bees.It is obvious that we cannot let uncontrolled modified organisms disseminate in the environment.The main threat is thus the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where its DNA or RNA would be in contact with microorganisms present in the external environment.A machine is the assembly of known and controllable components, and this term seems to indicate that we assimilate a living being to a completely characterized system responding to physical and chemical laws.We also chose to place this bag in a solid device, adding yet another barrier between the bacteria and the environment.If patenting an organism were possible, it would lead us back to the perception of life as a machine, or a chemical factory, with no sense of wonder or admiration.The name Biobrick is a reminder of the Lego game and this parallel further asks the question of synthetic biology being conceived as an assembly game.We also spent a good deal of our time explaining the iGEM competition to visitors and participants alike, bringing the synthetic biology field, still quite unknown, into light.This communication experience was fully integrated to the Apicoli project, enhancing its exposure and credibility towards the public.One question leading to another, without realising it we where already giving a full guidance lecture on the choices these children would have to make in the following years (which school to attend and why, why study science, etc...).The relationship between humans and environmental bacteria is close, and even more so with the bacteria in our body.)The Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be set up in research laboratories (including containment), education, analysis, anatomy and surgical pathology, autopsy rooms, and industrial and agricultural facilities where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens.The rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (and thus in all public facilities working in scientific and technological domains) are set out in the Decree No.Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are at the heart of a long-term debate on the use of biotechnology in day-life applications.Finally, we do not aim at completely eradicating the parasite from the environment.If we focus on the human being, according to the law, his body does not belong to him, he only has a right of use.Having a first hand account from students who had to go through the same process not so long ago reassured them and gave them some perspective on their future studies.Synthetic biology is also setting off strong opposing reactions and not only because of the use of GMOs.)The main aim of this intervention was to teach children about varroa and synthetic biology while trying to spark an interest in science in general.We made sure to always check that the water-bathes were turned off at the end of the day.To manipulate into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms we used a Biological safety cabinet (FASTER \u0096 Ultrasafe).On one hand, we consider nature as fragile and in need of protection whereas on the other hand we see it as strong enough to provide all the resources we need to survive.In the previous decades or centuries, our vision of nature was more pragmatic and focused on the fulfilling of our needs.Science cannot assume that the regulation and policies of Research has to be made by scientists only, rather it is its duty to communicate the results of the researches and to have transparency on the experiments conducted.First of all, we decided to work with the E. Coli chassis, since its genome is very well characterized and it was well adapted to the molecules we wanted to produce.We also cleaned the BSC completely every two weeks.We have a dark room dedicated to the use of EtBr and UV.We talked above about the problem of controlling our modified microorganisms, and we put a lot of thought in the biocontainment issue: how could we prevent the dissemination of our E. Coli modified strain?We based the three parts (attract, eradicate and regulate)At the beginning of our brainstorming about the impact of Varroa destructor on honeybees, we found the patent US 8647615 B1 Represented By The Secretary Of Agriculture via their website.We had a very interesting exchange with the beekeepers about our project and synthetic biology in general, explaining about its principle, its interest and the practicability of our solution with the beekeepers.Our team took part in the regional ExpoSciences in Toulouse.Thus we only wish to slow down the infestation by varroa with our system, to grant honeybees enough time to adapt to the menace and reach a balance with Varroa.We also followed several other trainings that allowed us to use technical apparatus such as autoclave or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).The laboratory safety training requirements of the LISBP are detailed in the Rules and Procedures of the LISBP.Every new LISBP employee has to attend this training session regardless of its status (researcher, PhD student, intern...).The training is divided into two parts.During the summer, we had the great chance to meet and talk with a few ethicians: M. Vincent G\u00e9goire-Delory, M. Simon Desbois and Mrs Anne Cambon-Thomsen.In this case, bacteria directly died if they are in contact with the external environment.For the competition, we have to build genetic constructs called Biobricks.This specific plastic called TPX\u00ae is microporous and the size of the pores will not allow the bacteria to pass through.Being aware of the worrying decrease in bee population and having developed an ethical reflection since the beginning of this project, we endeavoured to learn more about the causes of this decrease.This happened at the end of July and our project had matured a lot thus the ExpoSciences was the occasion for us to test its welcome in the real world by exchanging with scientists.For example, if we would like to test our device on an actual hive, it would be by using the chemicals alone, and not the strain that produces them.Hence we asked ourselves the extent to which we could consider our experiments commonplace or ordinary.Our reflection on these ethical issues led us to realize that the reluctance towards the modification of living organisms could be linked to an anthropocentric vision of the world.One might ask if the importance we give to protecting bees does not have its roots in anthropocentrism since bees produce honey, wax and propolis, products we use.He offered us his collaboration, and made available his infrastructures, and his teams.Furthermore, several beekeepers from the forum \u0093La Ruche Warr\u00e9\u0094 heard about the project thanks to the same article.Everything in direct contact with something in this room has to stay there.Two specific trash cans are dedicated to the gloves or paper and the contaminated agarose gels.We have described above the relevant security measures taken all through the summer to minimize the risks of incident in the lab.This has changed in the recent years since biology today does not describe life, but rather tries to rebuild some of its important functions.This evolution induced a certain fear in societies marked by an historical creationism springing from monotheistic religions.This increased our visibility, and thanks to an article we were contacted by the Director of the \u0093Laboratoire Fran\u00e7ais d\u0092Apidologie\u0094 (French Laboratory of Apidology).Therefore the patent does not grant a property right on the biological material.That would designing a specific training for the beekeepers, and a safe way to get rid of the used bags.Another ethical issue that was raised by the concept of modifying living organisms was that of intellectual property.Thus it appears that the use the word machine is somewhat misleading, because biology is much more complicated than that.In order to protect the user, access to the NMR is not allowed for people wearing pacemakers, drug pump systems, staples on soft or hard tissue, and pregnant women.Scientists should be able to acknowledge that they don\u0092t know something rather than lying to the public.Bees, Varroas, an introduction to synthetic biology and, of course, banana DNA extraction!We prepared a short presentation about varroa which was followed by a Q and A session where student were able to interact with us and each other about the disappearance of bees, pesticides, varroa and synthetic biology.This way, the bacteria that receive the genes develop new characteristics such as resistance to an antibiotic.They helped us develop our reflexion and they also shared their knowledge with us while still having the skill to let us think by ourselves.This experience also enabled us to meet his Excellency M. Bernard Valero, the ambassador of France in Belgium, and M. Jean-Claude Guiraudon, CIRASTI President and MILSET Honorary President.Other pollinators that do not supply us with interesting goods, such as wasps, are less considered.Furthermore bees are the first pollinating species in terms of fruits and vegetables produced thus the advantages of protecting them are obvious for global trade.Indeed our system would be optimized to last at most 2 to 3 weeks, after which the bag would have to be replaced.2011-1177 is related to the use of genetically modified organisms.One for biological waste (yellow).Contrarily to what one could think, feeling fear as a scientist is essential and should not be overlooked since this is what makes us be more cautious and take a step back to study the implications of our work.Bees have an essential role as pollinators, that\u0092s why their preservation is a major social and environmental concern.We used the NMR machine that was kindly made available to us by the MetaToul platform to analyse our culture supernatant.Furthermore we tried to design a system that would be as respectful of the bee\u0092s life cycle and products as possible, hence the circadian regulation and natural molecules.Moreover the used parts are also non-pathogenic (the acids doses produced are harmless for humans).With the help of the teacher we were able to explain the basics of synthetic biology, the idea of biobricksand spark a quick debate about GMO use.The bench of the BSC was cleaned with ethanol before and after each manipulation.It is due primarily to the overuse of pesticides that have proven to act as neurotoxins to bees.In fact it seems that normality is illustrated by non living things, completely subjected to the laws of physics and chemistry, and divisible in smaller parts.Still in spite of this, most of the people interviewed weren t aware of the role played by Varroa destructor.Indeed, beeing able to use ethics at an early stage of a scientific project is not only a great opportunity but also a true advantage compared to being included in an already existing project in which you may not have time to think critically.Our project was followed by the regional newspapers (20 minutes, M\u00e9tronews, La D\u00e9p\u00eache), but also by some national magazines such as Capital or Industrie et Technologies.Though it is true that the problem first originated with men, today we cannot solve it by changing our behaviour.In this room, we are able to eat and drink (a fridge, a kettle and a coffeemaker are available) On the contrary, in the lab, we have to wear protective equipment and respect basic rules:We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals.The experience we acquired there was put to good use later and made us able to switch from a full science explanation to a simpler overview of our project without getting boring or simplistic.Indeed using synthetic biology to solve a problem attributed to a human behaviour did not seem relevant to us.When the invisible can have an impact on the visible, fear might arise.You can see here the sterility tests we realized.Another major cause of death for the bees is the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.The Decree No.Naturalists on the contrary believe that nature takes precedence over humans and must be protected from their utilization.A living being can be defined as a thermodynamic open system that receives and passes information, and is in this way a sort of \u0093anomaly\u0094 of nature since it does not tend towards entropy.Numerous products synthesized through the modification of microorganisms (reprogrammed bacteria\u0085) are currently of great significance.This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5.We further realized that the iGEM competition is the perfect moment to develop our ethical thinking.Our team had the wonderful opportunity to take part in the International ExpoSciences in Brussels.The ability to carry out this type of deliberation, to question one\u0092s own work, is what singles out a good scientist, in our opinion.Some colonies in Europe seem to start developing behaviours of the same kind.This one is taken individually with the NEO software and the explanations of the prevention assistant.This is a powerful but very expensive equipment, based on the magnetic resonance of the atoms.", "modeling": "In our case these maximum values are: Yet, we are interested in the combined effect of AHL and leucine production on the growth rate.From an optimization perspective the equation $mathbf{Sv} = 0$ represents constraints, which guide the numerical In our case the $mathbf{S}$ matrix comes from the in silico E. coli model K-12 MG1665.In our case we are interested in the leucine and AHL production rates of the type A cells and their effect on the growth rate of the bacteria.It also shows that cell A can not operate at the maximum production rate, because the growth rate would then be so slow that cell B would overgrow it.The second reaction of interest is: $$ \text{acylACP} + \text{SAM} \rightarrow \text{ACP} + \text{MTA} + \text{AHL} $$This reaction is important because AHL serves as the key to the motility system of cell B.If our promoters are too strong, the growth rate of cell A will be too low and cell B will be able to overgrow cell A.The metabolic network of the organism in question is represented as a matrix $mathbf{S}$  of size $m \times n$ .This is very important because if cell A has a big metabolic burden and thus, a very low growth rate, cell B would overgrow it and our pattern formation system would not work.To check the effect of our system on the growth rate iGEM Toulouse ran a FB analysis.Finally, the  vector $mathbf{x}$ is defined to contain the concentrations of each metabolite.Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.This is why Toulouse also modeled the effect of one biomolecule, but with the constraint that the other biomolecule is produced at maximum rate.Next  a vector $mathbf{v}$ of length $n$ is defined which contains the flux through each reaction.Here the vector $mathbf{c}$ represents a weight vector.Given this information the Toulouse team was able to locate the reactions of interest in the XML model file, and simulate the cell metabolism.This is something to keep in mind when we choose our promoters for the system.Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.This is the flux that corresponds to a growth rate of 0.This matrix is filled with the stoichiometric constants of each reaction.In generally it follows from the analysis that the more AHL or leucine is produced the smaller the biomass output becomes.The steady state solution Which is the nullspace of $mathbf{S}$.We see that the production values are way smaller in this simulation.We cooperated with Toulouse on the modeling.Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.Each of the $m$ matrix rows represents a unique compound.", "notebook": "This successful event was a good opportunity for us to start learning how to design a poster and to communicate about synthetic biology.We held our first meeting without instructors to discuss the design of the constructions needed to create the engineered bacteria.The butyrate genes were cloned into the PL-LacI-ccr pUC57 Plasmid.Blandine took part to iGEM meetup France organized by iGEM Bordeaux Team, where she met different teams, discussing with them, and presenting our project.To do so we designed a booklet explaining our project and what iGEM is.We first started searching for genes that we would like to have in our constructions on the iGEM registry.After we successfully designed our construct we started thinking about what our device would look like.How does the competition works and what are the important deadlines?Those presentations gave us the opportunity to understand more about the iGEM competition and to get to know each other (since we don\u0092t all come from the same institutions).First team meeting, our instructors informed us on the competition more specifically and how the team is organized.Here are few examples of projects reviewed: Our youngest instructor and team mother Mathilde B\u00e9raud went with Beno\u00eet Pons to the FSIE committee, and thanks to their intervention, we obtained \u0080 4000 !Start again for the ones that did not work...The first cloning worked for the final construction: a first step has been completed (the formate genes were cloned into the PL-CI pUC57 plasmid).We could now begin the genetic construction, but we faced a problem with the vectors: receptors genes were cloned into vectors incompatible with our final construction plan, so we had to look for an alternative solution.Thomas and M\u00e9lany worked together on the attraction module: production of butyrate We received our synthetic genes after more than one month of waiting for them.Another good news was the success of the first steps of the circadian cloning made by Beno\u00eet Pons Blandine, who created our Ulule account (Ulule is a crowdfunding platform) informed us that it was a real success.They presented a poster on synthetic biology and the iGEM competition.Anthony met Felix from iGEM Stockholm Team, and discussed about the iGEM experience, all the work done at this moment, his disappointments, \u0085 He understood that all iGEM teams were in the same situation: URGENCY.Even if the experiments did not work as expected, all the team smiles again when we received our polo shirts and berets that we will wear in Boston: we are ready to fight !We chose to implement  a circadian rhythm cycle which would allow us to produce toxic molecules during the night when bees are a lot less active.We Skyped with the iGEM Ankara team which is also working on Varroa destructor.We are eager to start, but are a bit pessimistic about the next phase of the project.Two members of our team participated in the Toulouse Exposciences.Indeed, we wanted to combine our efforts to fight against varroa and to gather some data about the mite.Now the real fight begins, hoping to achieve that we planed.The synthetic genes, which were cloned into pUC57 vectors, were amplified and then cloned during the weekend.All the team is now waiting for the synthetic genes and training since the 26th of June.Our reflection led us to the conclusion that our construction should respect the bee life cycle.Two projects were still in course to be chosen, the use of ice nucleating proteins to purify water and the creation of a  bio trap against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.Our first mission was to prepare a presentation for the next week on the following themes:Previous subjects.Following the newspaper articles published we discovered a forum of beekeepers discussing about our project on the web.We realised that our the cloning part would be quite long because of the number of genes needed to obtain... We therefore decided to order synthetic sequences for our synthetic pathway constructions.Laetitia Chaumont, Benoit Pons and Mathilde Beraud went to a laboratory studying varroa(Vacbio EA 4357).Nonetheless, good mood of the team!the bacteria should not produce both attractive and toxic molecules at the same time.This last one was chosen to be our project on the grounds that it  was the most feasible.Every group of two or three students presented one of the subjects seen above.The formate genes (pflA and pflB), the butyrate genes without ccr and the POmpC-LacI box-CI were cloned into pSB1C3.Based on bibliography, the initial idea was to build an engineered bacteria which will have to produce butyrate to attract the parasite.In order to achieve this, Valentin Girin used the software Catia for the modeling of our device.Culture tests were realized for different concentrations of the Biosilta medium.Therefore, we decided to set up a more optimised protocol to assess the attraction of varroa by butyrate.We finished the design of our constructions and send it to our instructors for checking.The production of formic acid in the culture of the producing strain was followed.During the whole week we searched for ways to produce our molecules cyclically.Those results are directly linked to the undergoing cytotoxicity tests.We also initiated the creation of the plans that would be used to 3D print our device.We did cloning trainings to be as efficient as possible, Beno\u00eet Pons and Marine Pons succeeded the first cloning at the first attempt !!We also learned more about the beekeeping activity and the treatments used to fight against the parasite.Laetitia Chaumont obtained a meeting with Vincent Gr\u00e9goire Delory, the ethician of Toulouse White Biotechnology (TWB).Since our bacteria needed to perceive red light we decided to place our device at the entry of the hive but outside.Moreover, it was time to choose attributions to make the project management easier, below in the table, the main assignments.The following weeks were the subject of extensive researches on the topic.They were pleasantly surprised that we took the time to answer all their questions!We prepared some M9 medium, and also did a cytotoxicity test of formic acid thanks to a plate reader.An enzymatic test was done on the Biosilta kit with an OD reading, until the stabilization of bacterial growth.Melissa David, Melany Tanchon and Louise Gody went to Brussels to attend the international Exposciences for the whole week.No doubt, this is the final effort before the dreadful wikifreeze !!The presentations were divided in the following parts.The following weeks were spent brainstorming.During this period, we were informed by iGEM toulouse instructors of what this competition is, and what was expected of us.Strong headaches and itching eyes but still on the computer ?Fighting with HTML tags and continuously looking at the clock ?We received from Dr Nico Claasens lab (Wageningen University) the strains containing PCB en Cph8 vectors responsible for the circadian regulation.However two parameters had to be improved because butyrate is a very volatile molecule and we conducted experiments in a petri dish thus diffusion complicated the interpretation.!We did a cytotoxicity test of butyric acid and we were trained to be able to use the NMR machine.There is only one month left and we have to work harder to reach project goals.We realised two tests: one is a test culture on BW25113 strain under aerobic and micro aerobic conditions.The next step was to present every week, two new project ideas.", "protocol": "At the end of first pipe put a sterile cone and immerse it into Eppendorf with NaHCO3After 24 hours culture, press 10 mL syringe in order to expel gas in NaHCO3 solutionNote 1: We used culture in M9 because with the \u0093Acids production tests\u0094 we had data on this medium.Note 2: 10 mM NaHCO3 solution was used because pH was 8.3 so it would permit acid gas solubilisation.Protocol for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), From Thermo Scientific\u0099 DreamTaq\u0099 Green PCR Master Mix Place a thin-walled PCR

cells.In the end we worked with these concentrations:Usually we set 250 cycles around 24 hours so we have an OD measurement every six minutesTo do that centrifuge the appropriate volume of pre-culture, then remove LB medium and resuspend sediment with M9 medium to inoculate.Note: This step permits to eliminate substrates from LB medium which could interfere during NMR analysis.Place erlenmeyers in incubator 37 \u00b0C 130 rpm and TubeSpin\u00ae Bioreactor in incubator 37 \u00b0C without agitationAdd 100 \u00b5L of sample in spectrophotometer cuvette, complete with 900 \u00b5L

have to do several cultures at the same time.So, we use an optical For each standard solutions : in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf sample 10 \u00b5L and add 1 mL Bradford\u0092s Reagent, wait 20 minutes and measure OD505 nmPlot glucose concentration in function of OD505nm and determine the linear region In order to test if E. coli produces formic acid and butyric acid with genes added, we made culture test with modified bacteria.The only change is that no filters were used because the sterility is not necessary.Close the small bag via fusing machine and Put the closed small bag in a Steril laboratory flaskPositive Control: Inoculate a culture tube at OD600 nm = 0.1 in LB medium (Final Volume = 20 mL)2.When varroa heads for one side of Glass T tube and covers more than 2 cm test is over and we write down the side choosen by varroa (Butyric acid or Water)treatment they place a diffuser at the top of the hive and formic acid concentration As gas concentration is difficult to evaluate we calculated the liquid concentration balance using the ideal gas law and Henry\u0092s law.Put 20 \u00b5L of sample + 6 \u00b5L of marker (1 kb for 1 % gel and 100 pb for 2 %) into the well1a.In order to have varroas in the same phase it is necessary to add one step and it is important for reproducibility of theexperiments.For butyric acid, the concentration chosen 4 % (V/V) because this is the concentration used in the patent quoted (see \u0093Attribution\u0094 part).We used water as a negative control.For this test we use varroas directly from frames because we did not have enough standardized varroas.Tap on Petri dish and see if varroa moves.We used the same protocol as \u0093Culture on Erlenmeyers and TubeSpin\u00ae Bioreactors\u0094 with some changes: The objective of our device is to produce gas, so we would like to know the gas composition of our culture.For longer products, the extension time has to be prolonged by 1 min/kb.The last step consisting in the elution of the DNA is made with elution buffer or water at 55 \u00b0C 2.Use micropipet tip (plastic) To freeze: aliquot cell in 200 ?L volumes into prechilled 0.5 mL microfuge tube (on ice) 1.Plate several

the tubes and on the plate (A, B, C, \u0085)  4.To test gas permeability of TPX\u00ae plastic, we use the same protocol as \u0093Test of gas concentration\u0094.Each PCR reaction has to be adapted to the length of the PCR products, and to the melting temperature Tm of the primers.With this method we place varroas on adult bees so all varroas will be in phoretic phase.With small brush take varroas from Petri dish and put them on bees in box through aeration holesPlace the box in a 35 \u00b0C incubator overnight.Resuspend cells in 10 mL of ice-cold TFB1 with gentle re-pipetting.The extension step lasts 1 min for PCR products up to 2 kb.To simplify calculation we noted down formic acid A.We chose a positive control with a higher concentration, 2 mol.L-1, and then decreasing concentration in order to identify which minimum concentration could kill varroa.In the beginning we tested high and low concentrations and we further adapted the concentrations.Resuspend cells in 2 mL of ice-cold TFB2 with gentle re-pipetting.", "result": "Our results were in line with our objective to produce acids in a microporous bag because we demonstrated that with microaerobic conditions, To convert the concentration of formate into formic acid we used the famous Henderson Hasselbalch equation:As mentioned in the Eradicate part, our goal was to produce 50 \u00b5M of formic acid to kill varroa, and this corresponds to 77,7 mM of formate.Under our microaerobic conditions, the wild type E. coli strain produced 32 mM of formate.Aerobic conditions were obtained with a classical Erlenmeyer incubated at 37 \u00b0C with agitation.We used a minimal M9 medium to identify formic or butyric acid production by NMR.Aim: to measure formate production of wild-type strains in microaerobic conditionsIn order to plot biomass concentration we converted the OD values with the following equation:Substrate and products concentration was inferred from the peak area of each molecule on the NMR spectrum.Butyrate production from this pathway remains to be demonstrated prior to testing the strain with varroas.In order to determinate the amount of formic acid required to kill the mite, we tested different concentrations of formic acid on varroas as explained in the Protocol part.Figure 5: Mortality of varroas as a function of time for different formic acid concentrationsFigure 6: Histogram representing mortality of varroas after 2 hours and after 7 hoursFigure 7 presents a dose-dependency of formic acid on varroa mortality.In order to quantify the production of butyrate and formate in these conditions, we  first performed a test with a high concentration of the enzyme (50 U/L) and measured the kinetics of the polymer degradation.Figure 23: Kinetics of Biosilta polymer degradation measured with glucose release.The modeling suggests that concentration the Biosilta medium should even improve formate and butyrate productions but the experimental validation of this production has shown that this is not compatible with E. coli growth.In order to measure BW25113 resistance to different acids concentrations we tested two medium: LB and M9 with 15 mM glucose.For a perfect regulation it would have been necessary to delete the chromosomic version Conclusion: the wild type E. coli strain produces formate in microaerobic conditions but production has to be further improvedAs explained here calculation of the survival of bacteria was perfomed via colony counting after plating on solid agar medium.In order to characterize the E. coli strain growth in the conditions we plan to use in our device, we used a culture under aerobic and micro-aerobic conditions, measured the growth rate (OD) and analyzed the supernatant to measure the concentration of fermentation products.Using a more porous plastic Conclusion: formate permeates through the TPX\u00ae while butyrate exchange will need to be improvedThe bacteria impermeability of the TPX\u00ae was tested through inoculation of the strain  E. coli BW 25113 in M9 defined medium complemented with glucose inside the bag.As explained in the \"Results\" part, \"attract\" section, our objective was to produce at least 0.00001%, so the modelling indicates that we can theoretically reach it.Nevertheless, in order to have this glucose release production, it was necessary to calculate Knowing that one Biosilta kit contains the equivalence of 13 g/L of glucose, we should therefore concentrate the medium 7 times.Thus, we tested different concentrations of Biosilta medium with different enzyme concentrations.Conclusion: Biosilta medium has to be used in a more concentrated manner to reach our growth objectives.Aim: to determine if we can concentrate Biosilta medium to improve the concentration of fermentation products.We do not have the exact composition of Biosilta medium and cannot ascertain innocuity of higher titers of the polymer on growth.In order to model production in the most similar conditions to fit real experiment we chose a glucose rate of 0.0403 g.L-1.h-1 that correspond to 0.72 U/L of enzyme.To convert formate production into formic acid concentration we used equation (3).Thus, to build a biobrick with the full pathway, we cloned the ccr gene with all the genes necessary for butyrate production, as presented below: Figure 2: assembly of the synthetic pathway leading to butyrate production (5192 Kb).On a first assay, we did not detect any permeation of butyric acid through the TPX\u00ae bag.We hypothesized that in presence of a carbon source, we may be able to extend even further their survival time period.Figure 22: Bacteria survival test performed with the BW25113 strain on M9 with 15 mM of glucose during 15 days.The cylinder on the left contains the TPX\u00ae bag with E. coli BW 25113 immersed in M9 medium after 27 hours of growth at 37 \u00b0C.Test of two conditions: without enzyme and with [Enzyme] = 0.72 U/L Figure 25 (right panel) shows that the polymer is not degraded by E. coli which is probably capable of finding another carbon source within the Biosilta medium.Aim: modeling the production of formic and butyric acids as a function of the glucose release rates.We tested our genetic construction in the E. coli strain BW25113 but we did not detect butyrate production.Growth was visualy assessed in the bags after 17 hours at 37\u00b0C (figure 14), or with a culture in tube with agitation as a control over the same period (figure 15).Culture of E. coli BW25113 in M9 medium with [glucose] = 15 mM, at 37 \u00b0CGlucose was consumed approximately at the same rate for both conditions but was converted differently depending on the condition.Shortly, a solution of butyrate or formate was placed in the TPX\u00ae bag.To improve the production of butyrate, we repeated the experiment in a strain with a deletion of the phosphate acetyltransferase gene.of the first DNA fragment matches 5192 pb (butyrate construction) and the size of the second one (2070 pb) matches linearized pSB1C3.In order to test butyrate production, we cultivated ApiColi under micro-aerobic conditions to simulate the growth conditions in the device.Thus, the strain E. coli BW 25113 has been inoculated in a small bag that was sealed.According to the modelling results described in figure 28, we have to produce around 100\u00b5mol/L of butyric acid that corresponds to 0.0092% (V/V).Conclusion: The synthetic formate operon is ready to be used in E. coli and sent to the registryFor formate production, we designed a synthetic polycistron coding for pyruvate formate lyase and its activator protein.Culture under micro-aerobic conditions in 10 mL falcon, result obtained after 28.5 hours of culture.Unfortunately we could not detect butyric acid in our NMR analysis, but we observed significant differences for other fermentation products, proving that the synthetic pathway is actually interfering with the fermentation products metabolism.Figure 27: Modelling formic acid production as a function of glucose release for different growth rates (in h-1).Figure 8: assembly of the synthetic pathway leading to formate production (3090 Kb).Figure 33: pH of the two media in function of the concentration of formic acid and butyric acid.As a first step to develop our regulation module, we replaced the butyrate pathway by the RFP reporter gene and the formate pathway by GFP reporter gene.Each condition was tested three times.It is clear that in M9 medium the pH remains at pH 7 at high acid concentrations but not in the LB medium.Optimizing this production will have to be achieved before testing the strain capacity to kill varroas.We want to express the butyrate synthetic pathway by day and the formate synthetic pathway by night.On the right, the negative control cylinder contains a bag of TPX\u00ae without bacteria after 27 hours of growth at 37 \u00b0C.We then assessed the biomass evolution during long term growth in the TPX\u00ae bag (7 to 10 days).We then made a biobrick by subcloning the polycistron in the pSB1C3 plasmid (BBa_K1587007).Figure 9: extracellular substrate and product concentrations with or without formate polycistron overexpression under micro-aerobic conditions.Figure 9 shows that the only difference between ApiColi and the control is in the formate accumulation, so we plotted the specific histogram for formate after 3 days (Figure 10).Over this time, no growth was detected in the medium surrounding the plastic bag.For our system to be efficient, it was necessary to check that butyrate and formate could permeate through the TPX\u00ae bag.Hence, we used the mentioned 4 % butyric acid concentration, like the one first mentioned in the patent.Figure 28: Modelling of butyric acid production as a function of glucose release for different growth rates.We observed a maximal formate concentration of 25mM (Figure 9).Therefore our production level is not far from the target.We then checked the viability of the cells after 10 days of growth in the TPX\u00ae bag (tube 1, 1  and 2) or in the control tube (tube 3), by spreading diluted volume of the cultures on Petri plates.For the formic acid, we were able to detect it in the gas, probably because its pKa is lower than the butyric acid one.The cph8 biobrick was not obtained but we managed to build a biobrick (BBa_K1587008) with the cph8 encoding sequence under the control of a strong promoter originated from the biobrick (BBa_J23119).In order to have a global idea of the release of glucose per unit of time we then calculated the average rate of release with the following formula:the rate of glucose release necessary to have glucose during 13 days can be calculated with the following formula.Conclusion: It is possible with a Bio Silta Kit to have a continuous release of glucose for 13 days only the one calculated previously.Figure 26: Modeling of formic acid production as a function of different growth rates for a glucose release of 0.0403 g.L-1.h-1.Moreover, it would consume less glucose per hour so we would need a lower polymer concentration in our bag at the beginning.We hypothesized that by deleting the various production pathways for lactate, acetate and ethanol and the degradation pathway forConclusion: Fermentation products concentration can be improved with the enzymatic degradation of the Biosilta polymer.Choice of the carbon source to sustain formic and butyric acids production during 10 days24 hours.This technology is based on polymer degradation by an depolymerisation enzyme leading to a perfect control of the quantity of substrate released in the medium for a given period of time.At 10mM formic acid, all varroas died before three hours but as we explained in the Protocol part, varroas also stop moving at lesser concentrations.In the US patent US 8647615 B1, the concentration of butyric acid that attracts varroa mites is 4 % (V/V), but the final description specified the concentration is efficient from 0.00001 %.However, in the Cytotoxicity part of the results, we also showed that this 4% concentration is lethal for bacteria.Acquisition of the growth stopped due to a problem with the plate reading system where the bacteria where growing.Each condition is tested in three replicates and standard deviation is represented in orange.In M9 medium, the growth is slower at the beginning of the growth curve, however the maximum value of OD reached is almost the same for both medium.The concentration of products (left panel) is clearly different in the two conditions: with the enzyme, more fermentation products are formed.Fermentation products have high concentrations in comparison to the cultures in performed in M9 (15 mM glucose), around 20 times more for lactate, 3 times more for acetate and 2 times more for ethanol.These genes were amplified by PCR and subcloned in pSB1C3 (at this step, a RBS was added to sequence during the PCR).The molecules exchanged between the bag and the surrounding air were desorbed in a solution of sodium bicarbonate.Our final objective was to prepare a bag containing bacteria producing alternatively butyric acid (during the day)and formic acid (during the night) and for a period of time of at least ten days (so that beekeepers don t have to change them every morning...).Doing so, it should be easy to assess the functioning of the light sensor and the NOT logic gate since the colonies should be red by day and green by night.To do so, we synthesized the pOMPC-cI gene (new biobrick BBa_K1587006)Through subcloning the GFP reporter gene (BBa_E0240) was placed under control of this promoter.Except for the 1.5 U/L enzyme concentration, there was an increase of OD in all conditions during 12 days.Culture with BW25113 on 48 wells plate and optical readerFrom these three figures it is evident that we cannot reach the growth level that is expected and that concentrated Biosilta is actually detrimental to growth.Conclusion: concentrating the Biosilta medium is not compatible with E. coli growth.The Biosilta medium was successfully used to have a continuous release of glucose over two weeks.The culture tube contains bacteria growing in parallel of the biological sample tubes shown above (t = 17 hours, 37 \u00b0C, 130 rpm).Additional experiments will be needed to go further (test of our enzymes expression, measurements of intracellular pools to identify metabolic locks, growth at other pH, deletions to prevent the accumulation of other fermentation products as explained in [1]...).Conclusion: butyrate production has to be improved in our strain and under our conditions Butyrate is an effective attractant for varroas.Therefore, formic acid permeats through the TPX plastic.Figure 29: Bacteria growth as a function of time for different concentrations of Biosilta medium.Thus, we only had to clone the synthesized genes into pSB1C3 to be sent to the iGEM registry.At the time of this test, there were not a lot of varroas available, so we add to make only one test in order to hope a significant result.We investigated if the bacteria could grow inside a small bag of TPX\u00ae.OD600 nm served to monitor a putative growth in the external medium.Figure 15: Control of figure 14 with a growth test of E. coli BW 25113 in a culture tube.We concluded that the bacteria are contained in the bag.The growth tendency is toward a continous increase over the experiment time.This strain produces lower amount of acetate, a fermentation product which production is likely to compete with butyrate.Figure 4: Test of butyrate production in E. coli strain deleted for pta gene.After 2 days and until the end, the growth rate changes gradually and becomes constant, at the highest between 2 and 4 days and decreasing thereafter.With the rate of glucose release calculated above, an FBA and FVA simulation were launched as explained in Modeling part.We will now see if buffering our medium has a positive action on growth.Butyric and formic acids production does not stop the growth within our targeted ranges of concentrations.The same experiment was therefore performed by placing directly the bag in the solution of sodium bicarbonate.After having harvested the supernatant of the culture, we filtrated it prior to do NMR analysis.Similar numbers of colonies were obtained, indicating that the cells survival is the same in both culture conditions.to pass outside the bag in the gas phase.Moreover we now know that bacteria do not grow when the pH is around 5.The first arrow represents the promoter, the others represent genes.The first arrow represents the promoter, the others represent genes.There is a visible difference between the two culture media.This showed that the cells were able to proliferate in the plastic bag.Some conversion between the model and the real condition are necessary and they are also explained there.We did not succeed in associating the three genes together behind a strong promoter in pSB1C3 using the In Fusion cloning technique before the iGEM deadline.This phase was therefore not the one to analyse.Both constructions were placed together on the same plasmid but unfortunately sequencing revealed that there was some incoherence in the RFP sequence, preventing further testing.For our project we need to implement a light sensor system in our strain.Figure 14: Growth test of E. coli BW 25113 inside a small bag of TPX\u00ae.to analyse the products and the evolution of the polymer quantity.Likewise, the RFP reporter gene (BBa_K081014) was cloned behind the PL-lacI synthetic gene.This construction (BBa_K1587007) was inserted in the plasmid pSB1C3 to be provided to the iGEM in the biobrick format.", "safety": "", "keywords": "polycistronic chromoprotein standardized expression antibiotic antibiotics beekeepers inhibition spectrophotometer

the handbook turned to focus on pathogenesis, transmission, and prevention measures of mosquito-borne diseases; besides, we adapted the procedures of treatment to affected parts into cartoon, so that the public can read and understand it easily.Through the revising and communication on the handbook, we deepened our understanding that prevention and treatment of mosquito-borne diseases can not be achieved by a small group of people in a few days; it is a long journey, a huge project that involves whole human beings.As the people also living in mosquito-borne diseases endemic area, we hope we can do something for the people in African continent thousands miles away.After we finished the English handbook, we managed to get in touch with the Chinese educator in Zambia on social network, explained our project to him and showed our willing to cooperate.We decide to explore the way to alleviating mosquito-borne diseases transmission from the point of science and education and to set it as the main part of HUMAN PRACTICE program.May 2016, we distributed questionnaires about mosquito-borne diseases in China at first.6.Interview in Fujian Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0August 31st, in order to ensure the academic rigor of the handbook, we went to Fujian Center for Disease Control and Prevention and invited mosquito-borne diseases expert, Haibao Xu, to revise the content.In the first edition of the handbook, we compiled the collected literature and arranged relevant knowledge on mosquito species, distribution areas, disease transmission, protection against mosquito, and rumor clarification.The iGEM and the synthetic biology are known by the public gradually.In order to let more people to know us as well as getting in touch with us, we optimized our platform on WeChat and Sina Microblog.We could not predict the result of it, but we were looking forward to it.Receiving the response that they were glad to cooperate with us, the whole team was so inspiring: carrying our dream and hope, the handbooks finally could travel across oceans to a wonderful land where we could not reach to.We expressed that we wanted to send our English handbooks to the educational institution where he was working and hoped he can help us to distribute these handbooks to the people there.At the beginning of July, we completed the first edition of the handbook.Being inspired, we came back to our lab and carried out the second edition of handbook immediately.From the statistics and analysis of the result, we found many people did not know basic mosquitoes  knowledge, such as mosquito species, mosquito distribution area.Meanwhile, it is a though public health problem.\u0094 With the deepening of the experimental process and the increase of reading volumes, we firmly believe what WHO reported.In the half a day, we have obtained too much, and more importantly, we recognized the core of human practice program, which is enthusiasm.In the class, we talked about the development of Synthetic Biology, basics for Bioinformatics, methods in Molecular Biology and so on.We presented useful information in a more concise and clearer way, focused on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases and deleted mosquito eradication methods that can not be applied locally.We offered the service of answering the questions on the iGEM and the synthetic biology from our school\u0092s students and sent the news of the Frontier Science Program sometimes.The followers of our platform can acquire a lot of useful information about the synthetic biology and iGEM from us.During the winter holiday at the beginning of 2016, our team held several times public lectures in our school.Watching at the photos and short videos from Zambia in the e-mail, our hearts were full of appreciation.We affirmed our belief: insignificant as we are, we should never give up any chances which may make differences; we should keep striving to make a better and brighter future for the world.At here, we grasped a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of health education and working procedures, learned the enthusiasm for health education career, and gained the methods of health education as well as guiding concept.With the curiosity of those questions, we waited for the response restlessly.About a week later, we received the e-mail from Zambia.How can we convey our common expectations to the people in other countries?Our answer is to make an English version of the handbook.October 2015, our team held the info session at the College of Plant Protection and the College of Life Sciences in our school to share the information on the synthetic biology with lots of students under the help of school.When Zika virus becomes the focal point of the world, malaria, the mosquito-borne diseases which have tortured human beings for hundreds of years, is still alive, even though we have already developed and promoted antimalarial drugs like Artemisinin.As the first team joined the iGEM in Fuzhou, the reports of our team\u0092s story not only encourage the students in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, but also motivate many students in other schools.The aim of the public lectures is to improve students\u0092 interests on the biology.This result led to the idea of producing a handbook about protection against mosquitoes, which covers basic knowledge of mosquito-borne diseases and demonstrates a certain amount of frontier anti-mosquitoes technology.All the students in our school can come to have these lectures for free.With these efforts, more and more students learn about the synthetic biology, and most of them would like to take part in the iGEM competition.Except that, we made survey about mosquitoes among public, visiting Center for Disease Control, interview experts in the related filed.We will introduce our Human Practice project in the timeline.From October to November, our team accepted the interview both from the newspaper and the school radio station.Although there are still some problems, it is already a great leap compared to the first one.Our second edition gained recognition in the promotion.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Before the first week, we cultivated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.We sent our reserved parts to SYSU-CHINA team and ShanghaiTechChina_B team to help them to finish project.We distributed questionnaires about mosquito-borne diseases in China.We designed primers for \u00a0Cry4a,Cry10a, Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2,EGFP genes.The greens in the figure are positive for transformation.We designed the qPCR primers use of detection Cry4a,Cry10a,Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2 genes expression.The genes from Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis strain BRC-LLP29Molecular cloning of Cry4a,Cry4b,Cry10a, Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2,EGFP genes.Vector is pChlamy-3.Analysis of Negative Result?\u00a0Annealing reaction was not set.", "protocol": "Transfer the upper colourless aqueousphase into a new 1.5ml EP tube(RNase-Free).6.Add 250?l isopropanol, turn the tube upside down many times for around10 min, and let it sit at room temperature for 10 min until the white flocculearise,and then centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4?.7.Discard the supernatant,add 500?l,75%ethanol with DEPC,and mixthoroughly.Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4? and discard the supernatant.8.Dry it at room temperature or in the bechtop for 15 min.9.Add 15-20?l RNase-Free water to dissolve RNA when the precipitate becometransparent.Attention: All team members just can feeding the larvae of mosquitoes.While the transformation mixtures are incubating, add 5 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature into each well of a 6-well plate.Note: You will divide each transformation mixture between two wells of a 6-well plate after electroporation, so that the cells in each transformation mixture will recover in 10 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution total.9.Vortex vigorously for 10 second.Note: presence of small amount of unlysed cells would not affect the quality of the samples.Add appropriate amounts of buffer B (1/10 of buffer A) to the lysate and vortex vigorously for 10 seconds.Transfer/pour the cell lysate to pre-chilled filter cartridge, and centrifuge in a microcentrifuge at 14,000-16,000 rpm for 30 seconds.The clear cell lysate in collection tube is ready to use.Split the transformation mixture into two aliquots of 125 ?L each and transfer each aliquot into one well of the 6-well plate containing 5 mL/well of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature.(~30 mins)The larvae are fed every day with food C. On the 12th day (9 day old larvae), the water is changed with fresh water, and food is added (a pinch of food B and two tablets of food C).Wash the cuvette with 1 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution to get most cells out of the cuvette and split and add the wash into the same two wells.12.The cage consists of a small 100 ml bottle with a cotton wick that is soaked with 10% sucrose (autoclaved) and a paper towel lining on the bottom to soak any potential sugar spills which may occur during cage handling.The beaker is kept inside the cage overnight for the mosquitoes to lay eggs.The filter paper

The amount of enzyme required and/or the length of incubation may need to be modified depending on the bacterial strain used.Autoclaved 1000ml of the solution (121\u00b0C, 15 min, standard liquid cycle).* For reactions with larger volumes of vector and PCR insert (> 7 ?l of vector + insert), double the amount of enzyme premix, and add dH20 for a total volume of 20 ?l.2.However, you might want to check the pH in this case and adjust it to around 7.0 using either KOH or HCl as needed.To prepare sulfur-free trace elements for hydrogen generation, the sulfate salts can be replaced with equimolar chloride salts (ZnCl2 10.0 g; CuCl2.2 H2O 1.00 g; FeCl2.4 H2O, 3.60 g).1.Take 50-100mg tissue stored in -80? or liquid nitrogen.Due to random integration and silencing events in C. reinhardtii, we recommend picking at least 10 positive colonies and testing them for the expression level of the gene of interest by RT-PCR (or Western blotting, if you have the antibody to detect it).Tris Acetate Phosphate (TAP) medium from Gorman, D.S., and R.P.(~ 30-40 mins)The adults (both males and females) are then kept in the insectary room for 4-5 days, fed on 10% sucrose before they are again blood-fed to begin the next cycle.The used trays and cages need to be cleaned and dried before they can be used again.NOTE: There can be some variations in the mosquito rearing method and different labs may have different techniques.Das, S., Garver, L., & Dimopoulos, G. (2007).Each 50-100 ?L elution typically yields 60-70% of the DNA bound to the HiBind\u00ae matrix.Be careful not to disturb the pellet and that no cellular debris is transferred to the HiBind DNA Mini Column.12.If the OD750 does not reach 0.3 within 24 hours of incubation after dilution, incubate the cells for an extra 3\u00965 hours to allow for an additional cell division.2.Transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.7.About 20% of the colonies should be positive for the gene of interest.Add 250 mL Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly.5.Electroporate the cells with the above parameters.11.Transfer suspension into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.6.To obtain DNA at higher concentrations, elution can be carried out using 50 ?L Elution Buffer (which slightly reduces overall DNA yield).Place the plates agar side at the bottom in algal growth chamber set to 26\u00b0C and 50 ?E m\u00962 s\u00961.Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I bought from OMEGA bio-tek company toextract plasmids and the detail protocol is showed as bellow:1.If no precipitate forms, the solution is still usable.Fresh blood is collected with a syringe and put in a sterile room temperature at 2000 rpm for 5 min.After cooling and antibiotic addition, the LB agar was plated out using aseptic technique.Vortex for 20 seconds at maximum speed to mix thoroughly.Note: If any precipitate can be seen at this point, break the precipitate by pipetting up and down 10 times.16.Do not disturb the pellet.Note: A wispy precipitate may form upon addition of BDL Buffer; it does not interfere with DNA recovery.15.The protein yield with this method is about 2.0-3.0 mg/ml.Mix all the reagents, adding APS and TEMED last (gives 2 gels).Fill the separation gel in the SDS page apparatus and overlay with isopropanol.After polymerization discard the isopropanol and fill the stacking gel on top and insert the comb.Start the gel electrophoresis by applying 100-120 V and stop when marker reaches the bottom of the gel.Resuspend the cells with gentle pipetting in 150 ?L of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature.17.Vortex briefly to resuspend the cells.Add appropriate amounts of room temperature bacterial lysis buffer A to cell suspension (Table 1).Measure the optical density of the C. reinhardtii\u00a0cultures at 750nm (OD750)Note: For best performance, the OD750 of cultures should be between 0.3\u00960.5.Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.Note: DNA Wash Buffer must be diluted with 100% ethanol before use.The transformation efficiency with the pChlamy_3 construct will depend on the nature, size, and codon content of the gene of interest, and the physiological state of the cells.20.(~ 8-10 mins)The pupae are allowed to emerge to adults for the next 2 - 3 days.Place the 6-well plate in the algal growth chamber set to 26\u00b0C and 50 ?E m\u00962\u00a0s\u00961.13.Centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column for 2 minutes at maximum speed to dry the column matrix.20.Please inform the administrator before emergence to ensure safe.This protocol describes mosquito rearing in the insectary.Some people shorten the time for formation of the precipiate by bubbling the solution with filtered air.However, increasing elution volume reduces the concentration of the final product.Wheneverything is dissolved, cool to 70 degrees C. Keeping temperature at 70, add 85 ml hot 20% KOH solution (20 grams / 100 ml final volume).Bring the final solution to 1liter total volume.Centrifuge the cells at 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature.15.Complete digestion of the cell wall is essential for efficient lysis.The same mosquitoes can be used to lay eggs more than once.The mosquitoes that are not needed for experiments or rearing can be killed by placing the cage in a freezer.Repeat Steps 24-26 for a second DNA Wash Buffer wash step.28.If a shaking water bath is not available, incubate the samples and shake or briefly vortex every 20-30 minutes.9.Add 2 ?g linearized plasmid DNA (i.e., pChlamy_3 construct containing your gene of interest) into the resuspended cells.Ultimately, this procedure resulted in three 1L LB agar solutions with a different antibiotic in each.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute to elute the DNA.Transfer the cleared supernatant from Step 8 by CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind DNA Mini Column.A small filter paper wrapped in a conical shape is put in a small beaker containing distilled water, making sure that filter paper gets moist.Plate the entire cell solution from each

acquisition cost to a point where most laboratories can afford it.Re-inventing the lab: Development of a highly flexible, affordable and open source robotic automation platformAlmost everyone working or studying in biology have heard about liquid handlers and robots dedicated to biological sciences.1) The consumables used by these robots are expensive and can cost up to 10 times more than the usual consumables found in a laboratory, which is simply too pricey for most research groups to afford for day to day operations.Despite the fact that many know about them, and could potentially use them in their lab, very few scientists actually use automation.One of the main difficulties is getting access to one of these robots.5) Other problems like complicated not sufficiently flexible software tools (with costly updates) or the need to have dedicated personnel trained to run the robots discourage many potential users.Our team has developed an affordable, modular and open source robotic automation platform to address these problems.A second recombineering step could remove this cassette without any residual \u0093scar\u0094 sequence through a counterselection using the inducible toxin.To do so, a \u0093scarless\u0094 genome editing deletion system is being constructed using an inducible toxin and a double selectable marker (amilCP and KanR).3) Many lower throughput but still time-consuming and repetitive experiments cannot be performed by current robots because specific modules that support their automation are not available or too costly.", "design": "(Nature

purification that uses the negative charge of the DNA to bind it with PEG onto magnetic beads.Then, we used 1 \u00b5L of both PCR products to do a fusion PCR using kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-F1 and kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers).After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Although it is not tested, we are confident that the cassette should work at least as good as BBa_K1744000.To test the effect of the toxins on the cells containing the different kill swiches:2 ul of culture was used to inoculate 198 ul of LB-ampicillin-Glucose 5% or LB-ampicillin-arabinose 1%The OD[600] was measured at different intervals during 16-24 hours using a plate readerThe only medium used in this project was LB in broth and agar form.This is a problem on many levels: it\u0092s harder to get a clean PCR amplification, the recombineering efficiency and specificity is impaired with long cassette, there is some elements that can be changed or are unnecessary and ampicillin resistance is not a good positive selection marker since it allows satellite colonies to grow within an overnight time lapse due to antibiotic fast degradation.To build it, we used BBa_K1744000 as template in a PCR with the primers pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R1 to obtain a part of this plasmid that contains the kill switch without the resistance marker.Thus, the marker amilCP, with our promoter and RBS, can not be used as a positive marker in recombineering experiments, but it could serve us as a plasmidic marker to avoid plasmid background and only the gene aph3\u0092-I would serve us as a positive recombineering marker to help us select the good recombinants.To do so, we cannot use our newly constructed recombineering cassette because the toxin will not be able to counter select with a functional vcrx027(the anti-toxin) in the background.So, the pKD4 casette was amplified using vcrx028-KanR-del-F and vcrx028-KanR-del-R (see primer details in the design section).The cassette was then purified by SPRI with agencourt bead ratio 1:1 and digested with DpnI to get rid of plasmidic background.The primer used are lacZ-homology-ext-F and lacZ-homology-ext-R. Then, the cassette was integrated in the genome through recombineering using a pSIM6 containing BW25113 strain.The resulting cassette was then SPRIed using Agencourt beads and used in the recombineering experiment.The recombineering used again the same plasmid pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and arabinose at working concentration and incubated overnight.So, the method can be used, not only to purify DNA, but also to get rid of primers and non-specific bands that are often smaller than the band of interest.It turns out that if the good colonies are blue, or, if any blue colonies can be associated with a clear result (like plasmid background for example), it would be much easier to design an automated system in the BIOBOT to seek and pick only the right colonies for screening.This system will ultimately serve as the basics for automated recombineering using BIOBOT, even if we haven t had the time to actually do it with the robot because of the early deadlines.In order to test our BIOBOT platform (which could ultimately do automated MAGE experiment), a recombineering experiment has to be set-up.After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Firstly, by doing so, we will enable cyclic deletion using our cassette on pVCR94, which is the only plasmidic that we could do so beacause expresses the anti-toxin of vcrx028 which is vcrx027 and would resist to toxin induction.Those clones will be used for phenotypic test of each toxins.The different kill switches (pBAD30-[mosT;ccdB;mazF;vcrx028]) were tested (see here for the protocol) to investigate if they worked and to know which one was the best.The cells are heated up to denature it s proteins and lysate it so in the supernatant we get only the partially denatured DNA with denatured proteins.Mix 10 \u00b5L of dense culture (overnight is far more than sufficient) to 100 \u00b5L of Chelex (5%w/v in water)Incubate 10 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius (you can put your tube in the PCR to make a program that does both incubations for you)Transfers 50 \u00b5L of the supernatant in another microtube.The procedures are specified by the manufacturer, but here is how we do it:Design your primers to have at least 20 bp of homology on both sides for the adjacent part on your futur DNA construction.Using the part in that fashion, if the colonies would be blue, it would be plasmidic background and if they would be white, then they would be recombinants (since the expression of amilCP in single copy is not visible).This part contains a portion of BBa_K1744000 and the whole sequence of BBa_K1744001.Traditionally, the recombineering technique use an antibiotic resistance gene as a positive selection system.Basically, the DNA source of the transformation doesn\u0092t need to be pure for a chemical transformation and can be highly concentrated in salt.We decided to use Aph3\u0092-II, the resistance gene to kanamycin from pKD4, a commercially available plasmid that have the characteristic to have flanking FRT sequence at both sides of the Aph3\u0092-II gene.exo firstly degrades one of the two strands of a double stranded DNA fragment through its 5\u0092->3\u0092 exonuclease activity.We found that mosT and vcrx028 were the best counter-selectable markers (see here for the results)Our multi-copy plasmid results shown that mosT and vcrx028 were the best candidates for our system, but we needed to test them in single-integrated-copy for it to be more representative.Then the two purified products were used in a gibson assembly with the linearized pSB1C3 provided by the IGEM team to obtain the whole sequence of BBa_K1744002 in pSB1C3.To assess these concern, the cassette needs to be modified in order to be smaller, more efficient in PCR amplification and recombineering and easier to work with in screening assays.Even if adding this chromoprotein to the cassette makes it bigger it can still be worth it if the difference between negative and positive clones can become more visual.To build this part, we ordered a gBlock from IDT containing a P1U8 driven amilCP ORF.Secondly, the goal of this experiment is to test the recombineering in a relatable context.Therefore, we amplified cassettes containing all the needed elements of the kill switches from pBAD30-[mosT;vcrx028] (which are basically AraC with its promoter, inducible toxin with promoter and terminator and bla gene from pBAD30) with primers (killswitch_ins_LacZ_F and killswitch_ins_LacZ_R) adding homologies that allow lambda-red mediated recombination in the lacZ truncated gene of Escherichia coli BW25113.Again, one primer on two binded in the cassette and the other one binded in pVCR94.The primers (vcrx027-del-F and vcrx027-del-R) listed in  of the design section are used to amplify the cassette as described in the same section.You can see the result in vcrx027 clean deletion resultsOne major aspect not discussed in the previous sections about our cassette is that it is really big.The primer used for amplification of the cassette were pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-R.After the gibson, DNA was transformed using chemically competent cell into E. coli EC100 strain.To do so, primers described in the design sections were used on different template: pSXT, ptac-ccdb-cassette, gBlock_FG1, pVCR94.Then another PCR was done on BBa_K1744001 with the primers vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-F2 and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers) to get its whole sequence.The principle under this method is that chelex beads display chelator molecules that bind to the ions released by the cells that could inhibit PCR.The recipe for all PCR mix is as follow:The PCR mixes were all done on ice and we followed manufacturer\u0092s recommendation for denaturation and elongation temperature.For TFBI and TFBII composition, please refer to other reagents section.Dilute digestion samples 1:2 at least to get better DNA yield.Place your tube on a magnetic rack and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Once dry, resuspend the beads in molecular grade water in the volume needed for further experiments.Transfers your tube on the magnetic rack again and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Chelex DNA purification is a quick and cheap method for DNA purification.Unfortunately, we had problems amplifying the cassette in order to integrate it in the genome so we did not have the chance to test the cassette.See the results for the cassette insertion in pKD4 insertion result section.We can now test our cassette through vcrx027 deletion.The clones were confirmed by digestion and lyophilised for IGEM shipping.This part is the optimisation conclusion of the final deletion cassette.In each case, one of the two primer in internal to the pKD4 cassette and will only bind to pVCR94 if the pKD4 cassette was successfully integrated.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and glucose amounts.Since the kanamycin marker is no longer wanted in pVCR94 and is adjacent to the gene to delete, we will delete it as well.For schematique details on the resulting plasmid, please visit:The clones for each construction were screened by digestion (results not shown) and good clones for each constructions were obtained.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and arabinose amounts.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics amounts.The full protocol is available with the kit purchase.IMPORTANT NOTE: This technique can be affected by the buffer in which the DNA lies.Both come from BIOBASIC, their catalog numbers are SD7002(S518) and SD7003(S519).Here are the complete list of antibiotics used in this project with the working concentration for each:TFBI:30 mM KOAc, 100 mM RbCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MnCl2, 15 % glycerol, pH 5.8 (adjusted with acetic acid), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.TFBII:10 mM MOPS or PIPES, 75 mM CaCl2, 10 mM RbCl, 15 % glycerol, pH 6.5 (adjust with KOH), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.The polymerase used for all experiment was Veraseq from Enzymatics\u0099.They were used as described in the primer table in the design section.You can also see in the results that the colonies with BBa_K1744001 inserted in single copy in the genome were not really blue.All the tested clones for mosT shown that behavior, but only 1 of the 3 vcrx028 clones did.Those plasmid are thermosensible (the origin of replication do not work at 37 degrees Celsius) and the lambda red system is heat induced.See the protocol or See the resultsSince vcrx028 seems to work better than other toxins, we decide to use it in order to test a cyclic recombineering cassette using the as template.pVCR94 is a plasmid isolated during the 1994 cholerae outbreak in a Rwanda refugee camp.This part is basically just the previously described cassette, but transferred in pSB1C3 for IGEM shipping of the part.This comes from the fact that recombineering uses lambda red system.As the primer name says, the first pair screened the 5\u0092 end of the insertion and the second pair screened the 3\u0092 end section of the insertion.Furthermore, the longer the DNA molecule, the more affinity it will have for the beads because it carries more negative charge than smaller DNA fragments.After confirmation of the recombinants, they were tested and it shown that both killswitch were still working even in single copy.All of these primers are described in the primer table .The cassette basically contain an araC gene for repression, an arabinose inducible vcrx028 toxin and a resistance gene for ampicillin (bla), see the part description for full design information.As shown in the results, all the recombinants tested were good.We will firstly need to take out vcrx028 to take out vcrx027 with our cassette and make our cassette \u0093pop-out\u0094 with a fusion PCR of both adjacent regions.The first thing to do is to delete vcrx028 from pVCR94.That be said, we still have a working cassette with strong results to send to IGEM Headquarters as a part.Preliminary results will not be shown for they are not necessary to the comprehension of this section.To do so BBa_K1744001 was amplified using kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-F and kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-R. Then 1 \u00b5L of a 1/100 dilution of PCR product was used in a second round of PCR to enlarge the homologies to 80 bp approximately.All PCR except those specified in the text were made with 50 Celsius degrees as annealing temperature.The inserts and the vector were then mixed for Gibson experiment.It was designed to contain the advantages of both preceding parts : the working vcrx028 kill switch and the dual positive marker amilCP-aph.The results for the clean deletion was perfect.Than a polymerase will fill the sequence left empty by the exonuclease and a ligase will join both strands together.The DNA of those clones was then extracted using Chelex method and screened through PCR using 2 different pairs of primers.There is two major adds and changes to the protocol.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.It contains kanamycin resistance from pOK12 (a commercially available plasmid) which is a truncated, shorter version of Aph3\u0092-I and amilCP, a deep blue chromoprotein Biobrick standardised by a previous IGEM team from part BBa_K592009.In this section, we will detail the experiments leading to a fully working clean deletion system through recombineering.2015 for details, this version had the multiple resistance genes region deleted and replaced by Spectinomycin resistance).Those two fact explains the major changes in the protocol.The aspects of the colonies was indeed deep blue.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB ampicillin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.The plasmid used was still pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB ampicillin, streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and glucose at working concentration and incubated overnight.(2000) and uses three protein for the lambda phage: bet, gam, exo.It is now a well known technique that uses an exonuclease to degrade 5\u0092->3\u0092 one strand of DNA, permitting the homology regions to merge.The 3 \u0091 region was also amplified on the same distance with vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -R.Store at -80\u00b0C.When needed, cells can be thawed 15 minutes on ice before using them for transformationLet cells recuperate 1 hour at 37 degrees before plating them on the right selective plate.To execute this protocol, make sure you have access to an electroporator and be carefull handling the device, as its function is to give electric pulses.Furthermore, we know that recombineering works in pVCR94 since there are quite a few articles that have used this technique to modify its sequence (one of these is Carraro et al.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin and chloramphenicol.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx028-KanR-del-F with vcrx027-28-del-verif-R; and vcrx027-28-del-verif-F with vcrx028-KanR-del-R.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_R; and 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_R.You can use 1 \u00b5L for each PCR as template DNAThe DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx027-28-del-verif-F and vcrx027-28-del-verif-R.To do so, adjacent 5\u0092 region of vcrx027 was amplified on about 200 bp using vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -R.It uses Chelex beads (available commercially) and heat to extract poor quality DNA for PCR screening only.Our team is sorry about that, but since the cassette will be optimised, we have put more effort on actually improving the cassette than making it Biobrick proof.", "result": "For the right side of the gel, the same clones in the same order were screened for the 3\u0092 end of the insertion with a primer binding in the 5\u0092 of the inserted cassette.We kept clone # 3 for further experiments because it was the one with the lowest background of non-specific amplification.The above gel shows a representative success rate of BBa_K1744000.The result shown above demonstrate that the insertion had a 100% rate of success.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.The success rate of the method is, so far, of 100%.In order to assay the expression of amilCP in single copy, it was inserted through recombineering in lacZ gene in E. coli K-12 substr.The cells were photographed to show the difference between cells with the plasmidic form of amilCP gene and the inserted version of the gene:In this previous image, you can see the appearance of colonies on LB agar when they carry plasmidic or genomic amilCP-KanR cassette.But, with amilCP, the plasmidic background will be eliminated rapidly because the colonies will be deep blue instead of white therefore accelerating the screening and eliminating a good proportion of the background.You can see that only the control exhibits a different amplicon size, and that all clones have the sized band.The presence of a band in the red rectangle means the clone is good.We can see that after 10-12 hours, all the tested clones of mosT recombinants and 1 of the vcrx028 ones started growing even if arabinose was present.This was achieved through PCR screening as described in the experiment section.As it can be seen on the above gel, all of the clone exhibit the correct size band.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.In a recombineering experiment, the longest part if often the screening.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The only thing that is not good about this result is that there is non-specific amplification in all of the clones.The second primer pair (at right) produces a 1.7 kb band if kanR-amilCP was successfully inserted in the genome and a 1.2 kb band if it did not.Therefore, we conclude that vcrx028 is the most fitted counter-selectable marker for our clean deletion system.This section shows the results for pKD4\u0092s cassette insertion in pVCR94 and deletion of vcrx028.In the other hand, it would be unlikely that the predicted band could be non-specific because we screened with two primer pairs for confirmation.For the first series of amplification, the clones were tested for 5\u0092 end of the insertion, with a primer binding in the 3\u0092 of the cassette.It also shows that both mosT and vcrx028 are the most deadly among the tested toxins.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].As you can see, the expression of amilCP in single copy is not sufficient to make the colonies blue even faintly.As you can see, the success rate is really high.The clone order is the same on 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 screening.The first one (at left) produce a 875 bp amplicon if insertion of the part in the genome is successful but no bands if it failed.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].Therefore, no product should be visible if the cassette was not inserted at the right place.Thing is that we restarted the PCR verification multiple times but we could not get rid of the non-specific binding.", "safety": "Of course, like for mechanical tests, we had our glasses on, and, if required, when we were using a reflow-oven, using gloves to manipulate the PCB afterwards.All manipulations implying a living organism have been executed in a certified level 1 biosecurity laboratory.Here are some examples of the biggest safety concerns we had during our project.A standard procedure we followed when testing new mechanical assembly, for examples the platform motion system or the centrifuge plate spinning, we would always wear safety glasses.That way, risk to damage the equipment and ourselves were lower than to run a full speed test right away.When soldering our BananaBoard PCBs, to ensure our safety and proper assembly method, we always used suitable equipment located in a controlled environment.Also, to help detect problems and prevent it, we would start with a low speed test and doing faster tests as the previous was concluding.So, when testing new design for the first time, or trying new things with them, safety was a concern we needed to deal with.For our project, we design a lot of new electrical and mechanical systems.All

scale of AR in China was not studied until recently, which then turned out that some 53,800 tonnes of antibiotics enter natural environment from waste water treatment plants annually [2].As for the effect of AR on human health, some researches has suggested that it could lead to obesity [3], Some antibiotics can lead to toxic damage, allergic reaction, carcinogenic effect, mutagenic effect, etc.So we decided to focus on the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics residues.[4]Zhang, Q.-Q., Ying, G.-G., Pan, C.-G., Liu, Y.-S. & Zhao, J.-L. Comprehensive Evaluation of Antibiotics Emission and Fate in the River Basins of China: Source Analysis, Multimedia Modeling, and Linkage to Bacterial Resistance.[2] Zhang, Q.-Q., Ying, G.-G., Pan, C.-G., Liu, Y.-S. & Zhao, J.-L. Comprehensive Evaluation of Antibiotics Emission and Fate in the River Basins of China: Source Analysis, Multimedia Modeling, and Linkage to Bacterial Resistance.Among all kinds of antibiotics, tetracycline is one of the most produced and used.One of the most serious damage tetracycline antibiotics have exerted on human beings is the tetracycline pigmentation teeth, which is rather prevalent in China.During the course of paper research, we found tetracycline antibiotics is one type of the most abundant antibiotics found in urban rivers, as illustrated in the table below [5].Occurrence and behavior of antibiotics in water and sediments from the Huangpu River, Shanghai, China.Our team is determined to work on the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics in our surroundings.The concentrations of the target antibiotics in (a) water samples and (b) sediment samples from the Huangpu River, Shanghai, China in July 2012 [5].Stunned by the large amount of antibiotic residues in Chinese urban rivers [4], UCAS iGEM team is devoted to degrading antibiotic residues in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) or hospitals.And that is why it is one of the most resistant antibiotics.Nowadays, tetracycline antibiotic residues mostly come from the overuse in animal husbandry and aquaculture industry.Tetracycline antibiotics are protein synthesis and cell growth inhibitors, inhibiting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex.However, the relatively low price of antibiotics has also led to its misuse, especially in developing countries like China.However, the mass production and misuse of antibiotics make them detectable in many places besides hospitals.In order to tackle the resistant bacteria, more antibiotic drugs should be taken so the resistant gene will be even stronger.Our survey indicates that people have misunderstandings on the correct use of antibiotics.Those tetracycline antibiotics not absorbed by animals will end up in soil and water, and eventually taken in by humans.Out-of-date antibiotic drugs are disposed randomly which is adding to the antibiotic residue pollution.[6] Tetracycline antibiotics can inhibit the development of children s teeth and bone growth, and are also easy to cause allergic reactions.High concentration of antibiotic residues in environment also encourages antibiotic resistance, since AR exposure is a form of \u0093underdose\u0094 as Fleming has mentioned.Chemosphere, 95, 604\u0096612 (2014)  [6] Tetracycline antibiotics - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics\"Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant\"\u00a0[1].Some cases of tetracycline pigmentation teeth have been speculated to have correlation with high concentration of tetracycline residues in drinking water.In China, about 147,000 tonnes of antibiotics are produced annually.However, the degrading super hero in the wrong place will be superbugs.Since penicillin was invented in 1928, antibiotics have been massively produced and have saved millions of people.", "design": "In our project, the engineered bacteria carry TetX, a natural antibiotic resistant gene.Mutagenic drift is particularly important for toxic proteins- or essential genes-based \u0091kill switches\u0092, for the selective pressure imposed on bacteria may lead to a dramatic alteration in the gene frequency.In the beginning, we put tetX gene directly under the control of pTet, a tetracycline-inducible promoter, so that the expression level of tetX will rise as the concentration of Tc goes up.Among them, Type II TA modules are the most extensively studied, so we decided to choose some of them to build and test our \u0091kill-switch\u0092.The gene coding T7 RNAP is placed downstream of pTet so that when the concentration of tetracycline increases, the amount of T7 RNAP will also increase to produce more tetX.Actually our goal is to apply our engineered bacteria to the degradation of as many as possible kinds of antibiotics which was theoretically feasible with different degradation enzyme and our system (details are shown below in \u0093Extension\u0094).Currently there are mainly three strategies to design a \u0091kill-switch\u0092: (1) Suicide system, where toxins or essential genes are commonly used to mediate cell death ;(2) Codon reassignment methods change the corresponding amino acid of a certain codon , like stop codon, and sometimes unnatural amino acids are assigned to that \u0091new\u0092 codon ; (3) Auxotroph is also commonly used.For this reason, the E.coli bearing the original circuit is called \u0091Scavenger\u0092, and the E.coli bearing the circuit with T7 RNAP is called \u0091Captain Scavenger\u0092.Genetically modified bacteria mainly pose threats to the environment through two ways: horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and bacteria escape.molecular oxygen (O2) is incorporated into verruculogen without O\u0096O bond scission, which lead to the oxidative transformations of substrate this Mononuclear non-haem iron enzymes catalyse a wide range of reactions Tet X:TetX monooxygenase catalyzes regioselective hydroxylation at carbon 11a of tetracyclines.It ought to be neutralized by its corresponding protein when, like in the waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), it is not expected to suppress the growth of bacteria.Structural basis for a new tetracycline resistance mechanism relying on the TetX monooxygenase.After literature survey, we eventually chose four kinds of oxidase which can be expressed in E.coli and hopefully have opportunities to degrade tetracycline: MnCcP, CPO?FtmOx1, tet X. CPO: catalytic oxidative degradation of sulfamethoxazole by CPO-H2O2 in the presence of chloridion.To further improve the performance of the scavenger, T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) and T7 promoter are introduced to raise the expression level of tetX.Whilst natural existing antibiotic resistant enzymes serve as a pool for finding the right ones, other enzymes with similar mechanisms also have the potential to degrade antibiotics at a high rate.The concentration of Tet remains high in the biochemical pools before water leaves it, so bacteria can grow normally in the pool.Secondly, the toxin must be toxic enough to kill the bacteria with a relatively low dose.To check the state of the scavengers, a fusion protein tetX-GFP (BBa_K2150013) combining tetX (BBa_K2150101) with GFP (BBa_E0040) is constructed to replace the role of tetX.To be more specific, auxotrophic genetically modified microorganisms (GMOs) rely on a kind of substance added into the working environment.These bacteria depend on an artificial molecule added to the working environment to survive.Nonetheless, if the artificial bacteria escape from the work environment, the concentration of Tet in surroundings drops dramatically.In order to transform an ordinary E.coli into a terrific scavenger who can eliminate tetracycline(Tc), tetX gene has to be imported to E.coli, enabling it to degrade Tc.This figure also illustrates our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design, see below.This figure also illustrates our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design, see below.After a series of primary lab experiments such as transformation, protein expression, purification of protein, enzyme assay and so on, we intended to accomplish the screening tests of all kinds of enzymes we have selected, as well as enzyme activity tests and kinetics tests for enzymes with high tetracycline degradation efficiency.Enzyme with the best degradation performance would stand out through our screening and would be applied to the construction of engineered bacteria, whose degradation effect in vivo would be tested in further experiments.As antitoxin degrades faster than toxin in the cell, it soon disassociates from toxin, leading to accumulation of free toxins within bacteria cell, which eventually result in cell death or arrest of growth.No matter what method is taken to build the \u0091kill-switch\u0092, a good one should meet some criteria, namely, to prevent mutagenic drift , environment supplement and HGT.Tigecycline Is Modified by the Flavin-Dependent Monooxygenase TetX.In the presence of T7 RNAP, T7 promoter is recognized and activated, leading to increased transcription of downstream gene.In solutions of pH greater than 1, the product 11a-hydroxytetracycline can decomposes rapidly and non-enzymatically into products that are not easily identifiable oxidative reaction of tetracycline catalyzed by TetX The monooxygenase reaction mechanism relies on the redox properties of FAD.However, this does not mean that the toxin is not controllable.While staying in the biochemical pool at WWTPs, antitoxin is induced by high concentration of Tet.TA modules are composed of a toxin molecule and an antitoxin molecule, and can be categorized into five types .We expected the circuit with T7 RNAP to perform better than the one without.In contrast, the expression of toxin will not be impaired in either condition.This fact is fundamental to our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design.Due to this high activity of T7 promoter, tetX protein can be produced in large quantity when tetX gene is expressed from T7 promoter.Without sufficient amount of Tet, the transcription of antitoxin is blocked by tetR.For those \u0091kill-switches\u0092 which make use of auxotrophies, environment supplement is a major challenge.CPO is considered to be the most versatile heme-containing enzyme, exhibiting peroxidase, catalase and cytochrome P450-like activities MnCcP : Crude MnP produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was used to degrade tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) in the presence of Mn2+ and H2O2 .MnCcP is a designed CcP with a Mn(II)-binding site by making Gly41Glu, Val45Glu, and His181Asp mutations, which can be expressed in procaryotic organisms.However, the real situation is much more complex than that.Since many of the oxidases require coenzymes or cofactors to function, they may have problems expressing in prokaryotic cells or for in vitro characterization.In this condition, TetX is also expressed and it oxidases Tet in vivo.Biochemistry.44, 11829-11835 (2005) [10] Gesa Volkers, Gottfried J. Palm, Manfred S. Weiss, Gerard D. Wright, Winfried Hinrichs.In our experiment design, we just took tetracycline degradation as an proof-of-concept.We designed a \u0091kill-switch\u0092 based on TA module.After reduction to FADH2 by NADPH, the isoalloxazine binds molecular oxygen to form a hydroperoxide.First of all, toxins and antitoxins should be readily expressed in E. coli, which is a basic requirement for genetic engineering in all circumstances.For example, a number of resistant proteins degrade antibiotics by oxidizing them, so other oxidases with similar or same coenzymes are highly likely to degrade antibiotics in similar ways.In order to build a good \u0091kill-switch\u0092, there are some major aspects we should consider.(2015) 539-543 [9] Ian F. Moore, Donald W. Hughes, and Gerard D. Wright.", "human_practice": "Although it is really difficult for a project in laboratory to meet criteria for commercialization, we were really inspired how synthetic biology can make people live better in the future.(d) Most people think it is OK to use artificial bacteria in WWTPs or hospitals to degrade AR as long as there is certain mechanism is deployed to make the system safe, which is exactly why we designed a double-function safe lock to prevent HGT and leakage at the same time.After the speech, we also talked with some investors from different countries, and learned that how government policy and support can influence their decisions, which is actually what synthetic biology lacks.That is also why we designed a double-function safe lock, preventing horizontal-gene-transfer and bacteria escape at the same time (see our Design part).During the poster session, we introduced to interested attendees the disasters antibiotic abuse may cause and tried to arise their awareness of careful usage of antibiotics (Fig.In our survey, we found that nearly 60% of all participants know the terminology and the mechanism underlies.In the morning on 4th SEP, we gave a presentation on our own project: the Ultra-sensitive Controllable Antibiotics Scavenger (Fig.55% of them believe that antibiotic residues can be found in sediments, and this proportion is the lowest among those chose surface/underground water and farm lands.This figure presents part of the results of our internet-based survey on antibiotic residues (AR).A surprisingly small number of people know the fact that antibiotics are widely found in drinking water, as indicated in the graph.As a new team taking part in iGEM for the first time, we benefited a lot from it.Mr. Schroeder is a Penn Alumni and is the only patent attorney on the industrial advisory board of SynBERC (the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center), a major U.S. research program to make biology easier to engineer.We explained our design and other work in detail, as well as introducing tremendous damages caused by antibiotic residues and our special design to solve this problem with the technique of SynBio.On the first weekend in September, we attended Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC).This indicates that even professionals know little about the scale and harm of antibiotic residues.Particularly, Mr. Schroeder also talked about how the iGEM competition has contributed to the development of synthetic biology and its industrialization.Our team sincerely wish more and more people, especially technical talents, can join the battle against antibiotic abuse with us, creating a safer and healthier future for the human beings.In general, the public underestimate the harm of antibiotic residues in environments and industrial products.China, as the world\u0092s biggest and the most fast-growing economy, is also catching up in scientific research.When questioned whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms(GMOs) in waste water treatment plants(WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory.We also designed several questions on antibiotic residues, which is directly linked to our project.Antibiotic abuse is one of the major causes for antibiotic resistance, and this has gained much awareness from the general public.In CCiC, we tried our best to make everyone realize the importance of dealing with antibiotic residues more or less.We designed a questionnaire and conducted an internet-based survey on antibiotic resistance, antibiotic residues and asked participants\u0092 opinions (especially safety concerns) on our project.At last, we asked people about security problems in our project.After presentation, we received a lot of attention from teachers and some other teams, further answering their questions about our project.From Mr. Schroeder\u0092s speech, we learned how synthetic biology could be applied to produce real products that are closely connected to environment protection, manufacture green material and so on.What is more, we also observed that biological majors did not outperform non-biological majors on antibiotic residues.People tend to believe that antibiotic residues widely exist in nature.(a) Most use antibiotics according doctor\u0092s prescription, but abuse in hospital is also a prominent problem.Most of them (at least 67%) know that antibiotics can be detected in meats (poultries, fish and cattle), but only 30% said they know antibiotics occur in drinking water, with merely 24% chose honey.", "modeling": "Since the quantity of substrate is limited in our experiments and the parameters should have clear physical meaning for further analysis, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model[5] as follows?

L. Shuler, S. Leung, and C. C. Dick, Mathematical Model For The Growth Of A Single Bacterial Cell, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1979, 326(326):35\u009652.The maximums of growth rate is slightly affected by the toxin of aTc, but it will do not change the discussion above.[2] Bruce R. Levin, Frank M. Stewart & Lin Chao, Resource-Limited Growth, Competition, And Predation: A Model And Experimental Studies With Bacteria And Bacteriophage, The American Naturalist.For any given ${gamma _P}$ , equation (23) can be fitted by multiple linear regression.The accurate solution of equation set (5) is not necessary because the expression of toxin only affect the terminal concentration of tetracycline degradation.Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.In addition, the growth rate curve of toxin 136 shows that the performance of antitoxin is not as good as others, thus we only focus on toxin 134,1204 and 6429.Accordingly, we can assume that the growth rate of total number of plasmids is equal to that of cells: Firstly, we discuss the solution of equation set (9) when ? is constant.At a concentration of around $0.8\text{ }!!~!!\text{ }!!mu!!\text{ g}/\text{ml}$ to $1..5\text{ }!!~!!\text{ }!!mu!!\text{ g}/\text{ml}$, a rough boundary can be seen, which confirmed that a switch effect occurs.The fitted values for parameters are shown in the table 1.From table 3, we can conclude that the corresponding antitoxin of toxin 6249 is most efficient.Then we assign ${gamma _P}$ point by point with a step of 0.000001 and find the best ${gamma _P}$ that maximize the linear coefficient.Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied.In the tetracycline uptake process of E.coli, two systems are involved: the rapid concentration-driven system which occurs initially and is insensitive to metabolic inhibitors, and the slow energy-driven system whose rate is only one-tenth of the rapid system[19].In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy, and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods, to show the influence of toxin and toxin-antitoxin coupling.For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.Can there be a model that fulfill the same functions as the traditional models, but with less parameters and with the least experiments?From the analysis mentioned above, we can conclude that toxin 6249 is most toxic and stable, its antitoxin is most efficient in neutralization as well.The example above clearly demonstrates the fact that, ODE model is sensitive to the values of parameters.Bacteria growth and protein expression are the most fundamental issues in synthetic biology.Therefore v(t) can be solved: Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density.Therefore, we employ ingenious tactics to build a practicable model of antibiotics degradation protein expression, bacteria growth under toxin-antitoxin coupling, and the overall circuit by in-depth analysis with least experiments.As is shown in figure 11, B(c) is low but not zeros when the concentration of tetracycline is zeros, this phenomenon indicates that leakage of promoter happens.Though it is still unknown whether the concentration-driven system can be categorized as passive diffusion or facilitated transport, the transportation rate is in proportion to the gradient of tetracycline concentration.The term 1 and term 4 of equation (12) take the vast majority of the sum of absolute values.5 Test result of the hypothesis for each type of bacteria in different concentration of aTc.We respectively measured the bacteria growth under different concentration of anhydrotetracycline(aTc), which induce the expression of toxin.On the contrary, bacteria are not influenced by the toxin inducer when antitoxins are expressed earlier.In mathematical form, the numerical relation is: So, we can assume that the existing toxin molecules are either in binding with target molecules, or in the toxin-antitoxin complex.[21] Goryachev A B, Toh D J, Lee T. Systems analysis of a quorum sensing network: Design constraints imposed by the functional requirements, network topology and kinetic constants[J].From another perspective, we can see that toxin 134 is inactivated before the antitoxin is induced by IPTG, which is because the leakage of antitoxin promoter or the instability of toxin.Dots are experimental values, and red curve is the fitted results.To make things worse, the ordinary differential equations are sensitive to parameters, and the errors will be amplified with time.Part 2 deals with the expression of tetracycline resistance protein, we use piecewise linear method for simplification, eigen decomposition method to extract the dominant sector.During the delay, antitoxin are synthesized and form binding with toxin.As long as the toxin is neutralized by its antitoxin, bacteria return to the normal state and grow as if in free conditions.Models usually relay on searching the parameters from previous works, but the values are measured under different conditions by different methods so the errors cannot be simply ignored.As expected, the shape and maximum are the same within error limits, and a delay can be clearly seen.The antitoxin is produced to neutralize toxin and the excessive part is degraded.Later, B(c) increase rapidly and reach its peak at around 2.5 mg/L, at which concentration the promoter is activated to the most.The form of the model is too complex, but the result shows that the replication period is converged to be synchronized with cell cycle.Our model minimizes the necessary experiments to get all necessary parameters, which is conducive to the industrial appliance and also propagable to modeling of other projects.It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions.Then the differential of tetracycline concentration within the cell caused by diffusion can be calculated directly.5, it can be convinced that the experimental group is the same as the control group under low aTc concentrations at the confidence of 90%, and distinct from control group under high aTc concentrations.Firstly, we add aTc in gradient concentration and excessive IPTG(8mmol/L) at the same initial time and measure their growth, as is shown in Fig.3 shows the growth of bacteria with toxin 1204 plasmid.The green curve is the mean value, and red area is the range mean value added and subtracted by the standard error.The bindings of first two processes are the limiting and rate-defining step.All of these substances can be degraded, therefore each has a degradation rate.It cannot be ignored because the lifetime of protein is rather stable that mRNA and peptide chain.Modeling is the art of description, estimation, prediction and optimization with limited knowledge and experimental data, which is exactly what we have to face.The demonstration above shows how to select an appropriate TA block with the mathematical model.[1] Liu, Y. Overview of some theoretical approaches for derivation of the Monod equation, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology.It can be expected that equilibrium sector and the degradation sector will still be the dominant ones when parameters are time-dependent.$G=Papp\times frac{A_{0}}{V_{0}}=0.67 s^{-1}$.We add a normal-distributed random relative error with a maximum of 5% to each of the 9 parameters in their model, which is far within the significant digit of these parameters.Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.Figure 9 is the calculation result, and the red area is the 70% confidence interval.The result shows that a much longer time is needed for bacteria to overcome the effect of toxin, if antitoxin is induced later than toxin.Since the bacteria in our experiments are of same species and are prepared by a same procedure, we regard the initial value of v as a constant in all these experiments.Therefore, a model with as many as 9 parameters collected from different sources are not only unnecessary but also unreliable.The reason for the delay is that, the way across the cytomembrane is different for aTc and IPTG.We fit the data with methods that mentioned previously, toquantify how parameters in growth function change with toxin.White blocks represent that the hypothesis cannot be rejected at the confidence of 90%, and colored blocks represent rejection at the same confidence.It takes the longest time for bacteria cells to overcome the effect of toxin 6249 after antitoxin is induced, therefore toxin 6249 is most toxic and also stable.In part 3 we integrate the two parts into a complete model, with which we do simulations to reach our conclusions.We study the effects of toxin alone on cell growth in our experiments.Bacteria with genes of aTc induced toxin 134, 136, 1204, 6249 and their corresponding IPTG induced antitoxin are prepared.OD600 (red)

degradation and procedural suicide genes obtained via screening, and many parameters are not available or not easy to search.Toxins may cause growth inhibition or death by targeting at DNA replication, mRNA stability, protein synthesis, cell-wall biosynthesis, and ATP synthesis [9].Thus, we only retain term 1 and term 4 in our equation.The latter is not as important as the former, hence we only consider the concentration-driven factors.8.Growth rate of bacteria with TA system induced by aTc and excessive IPTG at different time.To exemplify how error can be amplified, we would like to

collaboration, we measured the growth curve of E. coli harboring toxin MazF by 96-well microplate spectrophotometer for the iGEM team from Beijing Institute of Technology.During the summer, we worked hard to build our system, which consists of mainly three parts, and we got some quite promising results.We demonstrated that out of the four antitoxins cloned, three effectively neutralized their corresponding toxins.We cloned several potential antibiotic degrading enzymes, including TetX monoxygenase (TetX) and MnCcP, and successfully expressed and purified them.As a proof-of-concept, we showed that TetX can degrade Tet in vivo.We met with iGEMers from several universities including Peking University, Tianjin University, Beijing Institute of Technology, and Xiamen University, during which we discussed each other\u0092s projects and problems occurred in experiments.Besides collecting information from the public, we also get to the next generation.In previous years, dozens of teams have worked on tackling antibiotic resistant bacteria, while a small number of teams paid attention to degrading antibiotics, and few team showed solid data on how much antibiotic can be degraded in their projects.To measure the degrading rate, samples were taken for 30 minutes\u0092 interval, and the amount of remaining Tet were measured by LC-MS or UV absorption.We also attended this year\u0092s CCiC held during 2nd-4th Sept. at Sun Yet-Sen University in Guangzhou, where we lectured on our projects and took part in the poster session.They are also working on toxins to build a kill-switch, so our measurement can be quite important for them.We demonstrated that Mn(III) can also degrade Tet, providing a basic idea for future work.We successfully cloned 11 putative toxins onto

water channels in our hardware to inhibit the escape of our bacteria, and the bacteria in activated sludge can also be pumped back bio-pool.As long as antibiotics decrease to a low concentration, antitoxin expression will become less than toxin which leads to the death of our bacteria so that it won\u0092t be an antibiotic resistant superbug after accomplishing its mission.In our system, the degradation enzyme can only be expressed under high concentration of tetracycline antibiotics.In our questionnaire, we asked people about security problems in our project, for instance, whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory.That is also why we use a biocontainment strategy and prevent bacteria escape at the same time.So these degradation enzymes won\u0092t exert negative impact outside laboratory, and won\u0092t harm any plants, animals or human beings.We choose a non-pathogenic chassis, E.coli, and pay high attention to our project design, lab work, shipment, etc.Most of

decided to do a miniprep of the CUP1 codon optimized gene in order to do the restriction digest and gel the next experiment day.Copper measurements were taken through the use of a different plate reader.An overnight for the Ret1 transformed cells was done today to repeat the experiment at higher concentrations of copper.First meeting of the project over summer where we ran our PCR products on a 1% agarose gel for practice.Enough volume of the 0.1M Copper Solution was added to the 6 six flasks so each of the control and transformed group will have flasks containing a concentration of [0uM], [15uM] and [25uM].Discussion of the gel results and future plans on how copper measurement will be done.A gel was run on the transformed cells and control cells using Bullseye (left) and EtBr (right) to stain the DNA.We ran an SDS-PAGE gel using the samples collected from the experiment we did on August 19th.After realizing that the copper solution was interfering with our OD data, we decided to resuspend the cells in LB and use LB as our blank to gather the OD data.We ran an inoculation experiment using the cells with the CUP1 codon-optimized gene.Gel results showed no bands Digestion of the metallothionein plasmid with restriction enzymes (EcoRI & PstI).This gel showed a band in the Ret2 samples at a size of around 32 kDa, while our Metallothionein protein was expected to be around 6.5 kDa.The control plate had only a few colonies growing on it, even after a second attempt while the transformed had multiple colonies.We also ran two more gels with the experiment for Ret1 data.Another inoculation experiment was scheduled for today, however the tube of the overnight cells broke so instead a repeat of the overnight was done.After the optical density was read for the solution, the solutions were centrifuged and the supernatant in the eppendorfs were removed to be used for copper measurement.Repeated analysis of the digestion products on the gel.An overnight will be done tomorrow for the experiment on the following day.We noticed that we had to create different blanks due to the different copper concentrations that we did not do for the previous experiments.Since the Laemmli Buffer was nowhere to be found,the solution was spun down to be put in the freezer for the SDS gel in the future.Meeting with our advisor regarding current updates on the project and the availability of the flame atomic absorption spectrometer to be used for the copper measurement.Data was collected in the same manner except with a 30 minute time point after the one hour mark.Six flasks of 25 mL LB broth were prepared, 3 of which will be the control and the other will be for the transformed.We also discussed team structure and the CUP1 gene construct that is needed to be synthesized as a G-block.Based on the lanes with the least amount of noise (colonies 7 and 8), we transformed our competent cells using the DNA corresponding to those colonies.The control was spread on plates with ampicilin resistance and the transformed group was spread on plates with chloramphenicol resistance.To the transformed group 9.375uL of Chloramphenicol was added.The pellet in the eppendorfs were then resuspended with 200uL of master mix of Laemmli Buffer and were placed in the freezer to be used to run an SDS-gel in the future.At every hour for eight hours, starting at the 0th hour, an optical density reading will be taken for each flask.Drawing out 1mL of the solution from each flask into eppendorfs, followed by measuring the optical density.After further investigation, the Bulls-Eye solution was the cause of bands not appearing and we switched to Ethidium Bromide.iGEM team members attended a meeting with a professor and was given an overview to the procedure of 3A Assembly.7 uL of the Sigma Aldrich Wide Range Ladder (6-205 kDA) was added to the first lane while the other 10 lanes each contained 10 uL of samples from the experiment.From the second inoculation experiment, the eppendorfs were thawed on ice in preparation for the 10% SDS-gel.The second method uses a plate reader to measure the florescence of the sample.The second iGEM part, CUP1 codon optimized came in the day prior.The plate reader could not measure the florescence because there were no appropriate filters in the lab to emit higher than 700nm.Repeated digestion to troubleshoot any possible errors that may have occurred during the protocol.Today marks the first day we began production of our first cell line, Retriever 1(Ret1).The CUP1 transformed cells and control cells were plated and an overnight was done.The digestion products were then run on a gel stained with ethidium bromide.From Copper Sulfate, a stock solution of 0.5M Copper Solution was created and then a 0.1M Solution was created to be used.", "protocol": "An example label for a sample with Retriever 1 and initial copper concentration 0 mM at hour 3 would be \"Ret1, 0 mM, h 3\" with comma denoting separate lines.Using sterile technique so as to keep unwanted cells from entering the flasks, pipette 1 ml from each flask into the respective microcentrifuge tube that does not have \"Cu\" on the side.Pipette supernatant from centrifuged tubes into respective tubes marked with \"Cu\" for copper measurement.If recording first timepoint, blank biospectrophotometer with 1 ml sample of pure, sterile LB.Measure the cell density of each resuspended microcentrifuge tube at 600 nm and record absorbance.Prepare 1 ml samples for 10 copper concentrations within range being tested.Measure and record absorbance at these concentrations to prepare a calibration curve.Press the \"read sample\" button several times and wait 30 seconds before recording absorbance value.Prepare the following calibration curve samples with copper sulfate in LB: 0, .1, .3, .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 mM.Create a new protocol and experiment to measure the absorbance in all wells at 620 nm.Create a calibration curve for concentration as a function of absorbance using the absorbance readings of the known samples.Calculate the concentrations of the measured samples using a linear fit of this calibration curve.Label each pair of tubes with the hour timepoint, strain, and initial copper concentration.On one of the tubes for each flask for this timepoint, mark \"Cu\" on the side to represent copper measurement.Retriever1 4 mM, Control 2 mM.Add 9.375 \u00b5L chloramphenicol from 34 mg/ml stock to Retriever (transformed) flasks.Take measurements for optical density, copper concentration, and protein translation level.Prepare two microcentrifuge tubes for each flask per timepoint.Designate 1 flask for each strain for 4 different initial copper sulfate concentrations.", "result": "However, it showed a marked increase in copper uptake as compared to the control strain.In the future, we would like to adjust the expression of the LamB metallothionein fusion in order to increase the viability of the cell line.Each strain was tested for cell density and extracellular copper concentration at different initial copper sulfate concentrations for 7-10 hours.Ret1 and Ret3 showed no significant cell growth, possibly due to the toxicity of the protein, or due to the stress placed on the cell from protein synthesis.Eventually, we would like to insert a gasification gene in order to allow for the easy collection of copper laden E. coli.The Ret2 strain showed increased cell viability in high copper concentrations, but did not show any significant increase in copper uptake ability.Retriever 2 (Ret2) has been given the same CUP1 gene codon optimized for E. coli.The Ret1 strain showed no significant difference from control in either copper uptake or cell viability in copper.", "safety": "If our project was applied in the real world, some risks involved would include the possibility of disturbing the natural habitat of other organisms, as well as creating an oxygen-limiting environment.We wore appropriate lab attire and made sure to adhere to other lab safety guidelines.This project can be used for copper remediation in the real world.We wore nitrile gloves whenever handling organisms and deposited wastes in the appropriate containers.We worked with Ethidium Bromide when staining our gels and made sure to gfollow handling and safety protocols.All

uranium adsorption and recovery - we needed a protein polymer network which contains several functional modules.To address these drawbacks, the Peking iGEM team put forward the Uranyl Reaper project, which aimed to develop an innovative method to deal with uranium pollution.In order to achieve this goal, we designed an extraordinary biological adsorption polymer network which was produced by engineered bacteria and self-assembled completely autonomously.How to collect the protein polymer network together with the adsorbed uranyl from the environment?Impressively, in a trial where the concentration of uranyl was set at 10?M, the polymer network with the SUP module was able to sequester nearly 90% of total uranyl ions within just one minute.The fusion proteins could be brought to their working concentration by concentrating them directly in the culture supernatants, and the resulting crude concentrates could be used directly for the ultimate goal - the Uranium Reaper.Inspired by the autocatalytic formation of the isopeptide bond between a Lys and an Asp residue in the CnaB2 protein from S. pyogenes, researchers engineered a pair of complementary truncations of CnaB2, called SpyTag and SpyCatcher1.the results indicated that the crosslinking reaction between the Triple SpyCatcher and fusion proteins could be completed in 1 hour.Considering that uranium mainly exists as uranyl ion and its carbonate in aqueous solution, we applied the Super Uranyl Binding Protein (SUP), which was designed specifically to bind uranyl via structural calculation and functional modification.Finally, signal sequences derived from OmpA, LTIIb and PhoA were found to be efficient mediators for the secretion of our recombinant proteins.Whether in E. coli or B. subtilis, secretory proteins usually contain signal peptides that are essential for their export from the cytoplasm.Which signal peptide would best promote the secretion of our constructs was inscrutable, so a library was built in order to screen for the most suitable candidates.In view of existing as well as potential future uranium pollution, the current complicated, time-consuming, inefficient and expensive treatment methods seem woefully out-of-date.[1]Zakeri, B., et al., Peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein, through engineering a bacterial adhesin.A schematic graph of the whole project is shown in Fig.", "human_practice": "The Brochure designed for public education about the project, synthetic biology and iGEM.Additionally, we popularized iGEM among middle school students from the 2016 Peking University Alumni Children\u0092s Summer Camp (Fig.After learning about the public opinion on uranium, uranium pollution, and synthetic biology, we decided to design a popular science brochure (Fig.Uranyl concentrations in water from Weiming Lake and in coal-washing wastewater  In order to assess whether there are potential dangers in our immediate vicinity, we extracted freshwater samples from Weiming Lake on campus and coal-washing wastewater from Shan Xi province, and measured the uranyl concentrations of the water samples by ICP-MS.It could thus be demonstrated that we had no need to worry too much about the effects of uranium pollution in daily life because the amount of uranium around us was within the normal range even in an otherwise quite polluted environment, such as around coal-mining operations.Additionally, we also measured the intensity of radiation in the nuclear environmental chemistry laboratory where we did the experiments with uranyl-containing solutions.), with the aim of helping them to develop a passion for biology, life sciences and synthetic biology.During this summer camp, there was a team coming to visit our lab and they were quite interested in the routine work of the iGEM team (Fig.In addition to the questionnaire survey and interviews of front-end units and experts, we have done more work related to social practice.Interestingly, the radiation intensity value in the work area was close to that determined in the playground, which could be regarded as the background value.Both were well within the drinking-water standard of the EPA which states that the amount of uranium shall not exceed 30 ?g/L, or about 126 nM1.", "modeling": "They made it a way to choose the monomers suitable for crosslinking reaction.The Peking iGEM Team has studied and expanded Paul J. Flory s method to predict the molecular weight distribution of polymer.They compared their reaper\u0092s experimental molecular weight distribution data with the theoretical one and find it is necessary to improve the polymer network s orthogonality with its functional protein.The Peking iGEM team 2016 has set up a model on the basis of the principles of polymer science, to describe the fundamental properties of our bio-materials.The Peking iGEM Team has learned Wallace H. Carothers\u0092s and Paul J. Flory\u0092s methods to predict the gel point of three-dimensional polymerization, and developed the latter as a way to forecast that point of their SpyTag/SpyCatcher crosslinking system.SoP is

special software which could be used to calculate the molecular weight distribution of protein polymers using Flory\u0092s theory.", "safety": "We did not make any contact with genuine, and thus potentially dangerous, pollution samples from the field.Because the bacteria used to produce and secrete the proteins were sequestered in enclosed environments, such as fermenters, and we plan on only using the proteins instead of live bacteria to deal with pollution in the environment, we did not add a kill-switch in this project.What we did ourselves was only to use the simulated pollution scenes for the proof-of-principle test in the Bio-safety Level 2 iGEM lab, which means that we never made any contact with genuine, potentially dangerous pollution samples from the field.As mentioned above, the DNA parts are absolutely safe because they encode non-hazardous proteins such as SpyCatcher, SpyTag, SUP, mSA and their combinations.Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experimentThe original intention of the project was to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized material to deal with uranium pollution in the environment.The bench work followed some basic regulations as below:Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission was strictly prohibited.All involved participants needed to understand the experiment completely before commencing work.Any steps involving potential release of live microorganisms were performed in a bio-safety cabinet.Appliances such as Bunsen burners, electric heaters and microwave ovens were not left unattended while in use.All liquid and solid waste potentially containing living organism was sterilized.The entire lab was sterilized using UV-light every week.The last person to leave the lab always made sure that water, electricity, gas, and the air conditioner were shut down, and doors and windows have been locked before leaving.For the proof-of principle test, all uranyl solutions were prepared by specially trained professional researchers in the Nuclear Environmental Chemistry Group of Peking University.Additionally, the bacterial hosts are laboratory strains which are likely to be highly uncompetitive compared wild bacteria in the outside environment.During the utilization of the bio-functional polymer network, uranyl ions are enriched to a high concentration, which is a potential cause for concern.This year\u0092s Peking iGEM Team is trying to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized biomaterial to deal with uranium pollution in the environment, using the methods of synthetic biology.In order to prove the usefulness of the concept, we did a series of experiments using simulated pollution scenes which were constructed by dissolving uranyl nitrate hexahydrate either in TBS buffer or in environmental water samples from the Weiming Lake on campus and the Bohai Sea.The strains are restricted to the lab so that the cells produce the Uranium Reaper system are continuously under rigorous control without any possibility to contact the outside environment.All media that had come in contact with bacteria were sterilized to prevent any escape of microbes.According to the requirements of iGEM policy we never performed any dangerous experiments in daily bench work or faced any unusual safety issues.The characteristics of these parts had been described in detail in previous work, and all part collections, such as the signal peptide library were derived from parts that are nonpathogenic and harmless to humans or the environment.Almost all the parts in the project were modified from pre-existing iGEM parts, such as SUP, LBP and so on.It is thus conclusive that none of the parts would raise any safety issues according to current professional knowledge.", "keywords": "TAT-Apoptin antibiotics mechanical encryption calcitonin LC-Cutinase fusicoccin tetracycline controlled polystyrene", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite":

second approach would have the advantage that it takes into account the efficiency of the genetic devices, because our experiments have shown that aspects such as operator placement and translation efficiency have a great impact on the functionality of the biosensor and are difficult to predict.For the future, we envision that a model with optimized parameters could be used to predict a range of repressor concentrations for an optimal output signal and the desired sensitivity.Therefore, we investigated several crucial design aspects with our model.Simulated sfGFP production when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 8 nM repressor plasmid are used (blue lines) or when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 300 nM repressor dimer are present (green lines).A CFPS biosensor is an open system, which means that the components can be manipulated more easily than in a whole-cell biosensor.There are two fundamentally different operating modes with regard to the repressor: It can either be encoded on a plasmid and be co-expressed with the reporter, or the protein is already present in the reaction mixture.When the reporter:repressor ratio is too high, there is a strong background signal and the relative increase in the presence of an analyte is small and would be difficult to discern (orange lines in the figure).The same analyses could be performed in order to optimize a reaction with a purified repressor.Importance of the reporter:repressor plasmid ratio.As can be seen from the figure, there is a weak background signal when a repressor plasmid is used, because it takes some time until enough repressor has been expressed to suppress the expression of the reporter.According to the model, the fluorescence in the presence of the repressor plasmid should be significantly lower than in the presence of a \"neutral\" plasmid, which competes for resources but does not encode a repressor.In contrast, when the repressor protein is already present in a sufficient amount, there is no background signal and the signal in the induced state is twice as high.In view of these results, a pre-existing repressor protein is the better option for a CFPS biosensor.In contrast, when the ratio is too low, an induction is not possible because of the strong repression and because most resources are used for the expression of the repressor (blue).Moreover, the signal in the presence of an analyte is weaker due to the competition of reporter and repressor mRNA for resources.We then compared the results to a simulation in which the same amount of repressor dimer was present from the beginning.Otherwise, further tests and adjustments to the model parameters are necessary in advance.Using this procedure, it is also possible to generate test strips that include several spots that detect the same analyte, but give a signal at different analyte concentrations.This would allow for the amount of repressor to be precisely controlled.The results showed us that the ratio of the plasmid concentrations is very important for a functioning biosensor.Our model accurately describes the expression of sfGFP in our cell-free protein synthesis and is able to predict the effects of the competition of two plasmids for resources.We chose this operating mode for the characterization of our biosensors and used a cell extract that had been prepared from cells expressing the necessary repressor or activator.One crucial component is the repressor, because its amount is decisive for the sensitivity and background signal of the biosensor.Furthermore, when the intensity of the fluorescence is to be used for quantification, it is possible to obtain a larger linear range using several spots with different detection limits.Currently our model uses parameters for repression and induction which were determined for the lac operon.To analyze the differences, we modelled a CFPS reaction with equimolar amounts of reporter and repressor gene in the non-induced and fully induced state.Given the parameters of our model, a ratio of 1:1 yields the best compromise between low background and strong induced signal (green).We tested this prediction with a plasmid that encodes the arsenic repressor and a second plasmid that contains the arsenic operator in front of sfGFP (BBa_K1758300).For future applications it would therefore be desirable to determine the specific parameters of the repressor proteins we worked with.This is a convenient method, however, it would be an even better option to add a purified protein to the reaction.8 nM of each plasmid were used.The position of the arsenic operator relative to the T7 promoter in the PT7-arsO-UTR-sfGFP plasmid is not ideal, as the distance needs to be very small to efficiently block the T7 RNA polymerase (Karig et al.Plasmids encoding sfGFP, either with the arsenic operator (arsO) or without, were combined with plasmids encoding the arsenic repressor (arsR) or mRFP1.A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that in the absence of an analyte, the translation rate constants are most important for the output signal.Therefore, the model could significantly reduce the number of necessary experiments.Therefore, we looked more closely at the importance of the plasmid ratio.This is sufficient for making qualitative predictions about the behaviour of our biosensors, but it does not enable us to predict exact concentrations for the different biosensors we used.These concentrations could then be tested in the lab.Therefore, the amount of active ArsR was likely lower than predicted by the model.These results show that the model predictions are only valid for optimized genetic constructs and CFPS conditions.", "notebook": "Find out how we developed and optimized our own cell extract.See how we developed this alternative to standard biosensors, which is based on in vitro interaction of immobilized repressor proteins with plasmids containing the operator site corresponding to the

fluorescence in a plate reader, in order to verify the results obtained by the app.A lot of cloning needed to be performed, the ideal design of the teststrip had to be developed, a cell-free detection approach had to be established and the processing of the output signal had to be taken care of.To detect the date rape drug ingredient ?-hydroxy butyrate (GHB), we had to adjust only two components of our setup: The repressor protein and the DNA sequence that the protein recognizes.By the way, you just have to spend 16 \u00a2 for each reaction At first, you have to combine all reagents that are necessary to conduct cell-free protein synthesis.We consider our cell-free biosensor an outstanding instrument for the detection of harmful substances in liquids.Our measurement prototype for easy and

"Considering biosafety aspects it has to be unequivocally proven that the purified protein extract and plasmid DNA preparation are cell-free.In his opinion, the risk that possibly released DNA from our system is incorporated by competent cells and that these cells proliferate and spread out is so low and unlikely that it is negligible.Regarding biosafety, it would be a clear advantage if reproduction would not be occurring in the CFPS environment.2013), DNA is a molecule that bacteria from the environment can coincidentally absorb (C\u00e9r\u00e9monie 2004) and that therefore can affect the environment.To conclude, we think that in future applications PRIA can be used outside of the lab under the condition that these concerns are addressed properly.For further assessments of PRIA s biosafety status we interviewed Dr. Mathias Keller from the district government in Detmold (\"Bezirksregierung Detmold\").He lists examples for the environment where a close contact between DNA and cells are likely to occur, like sewage treatment plants, our digestive tract and the soil.In conclusion, our expert assured us that cell-free systems are safer and better to use for the user than cell-based systems.We asked how the district government deals with the release of DNA from genetically-modified organisms into the environment.For the use of these systems one does not need to be a user of a genetic engineering facility.DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2013.00005 Nielsen, Kaare M.; Johnsen, P\u00e5l J.; Bensasson, Douda; Daffonchio, Daniele (2007): Release and persistence of extracellular DNA in the environment.We want to do a risk assessment to determine to which extent DNA is released in the environment when using PRIA.This is true no matter how the DNA is produced.Guan, Zheng-jun; Schmidt, Markus; Pei, Lei; Wei, Wei; Ma, Ke-ping (2013): Biosafety Considerations of Synthetic Biology in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition.According to Dr. Keller the release of pure DNA is not governed by the German Genetic Engineering Act.So to which extent is the biosafety affected?Moreover, the release of DNA happens permanently.Cell extract is generated by cell disruption, for example via sonification, followed by centrifugation steps in which the cell debris are separated from the molecular machinery needed for CPFS (see CFPS protocols).(2015) who \u0096 by creating an ebola sensor \u0096 showed how cell-free synthetic biology can be a medium to transfer the findings and ideas from the lab to the field.We contacted experts in the field of cell-free biology and asked them about this topic.Biologically/chemically he sees as advantages that the stability, durability and insensibility against external impacts in cell-free systems are considerably higher than in cellular systems.That points out the public awareness when it comes to microbiology and genetically modified organisms.However, none of these problems occur when the system is cell-free.(2013): Preparing synthetic biology for the world.It is also possible to modify the DNA that is used: For example it is conceivable that it includes a kill-switch or comparable safeguards (Moe-Behrens et al.We wondered if it was possible to create a biosensor based on cell extract that is completely cell-free.We consider this a great contribution to the iGEM community.According to Dr. Keller, the uptake of DNA depends on the uptake frequency, the encoded genes (e.g.Therefore, it is important that there are no GMOs in the product.One of those is for example the problem that GMOs are brought outside of the laboratory.PRIA is an in vitro method and can be compared to ELISA, an assay which is broadly used for example in hospitals (Lequin 2005), in terms of biosafety.conferring antibiotic resistance or encoding toxins) and the selection advantage for the transformed cells.Although the cell disruption is very efficient (we had a maximum of 8 colony forming units in 100 \u00b5L of final cell extract), there are still some cells left after this procedure.At first glance, our two approaches the PRIA and CFPS differ when it comes to biosafety concerns.Projects based on cell-free approaches will probably benefit to a great extent from our findings and results.The Act just deals with the handling of GMOs.Sun, PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology explains: \"[...] we have seen both cases where colony forming units come out of the extract and when they don t.\"Although plasmid DNA persists only to a minor degree in host cells (Moe-Behrens et
