PCC 6803, and a histidine kinase domain from a protein called EnvZ from E. coli.Generally, two families of recombinase have been identified: the tyrosine recombinase and the serine recombinase [5].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].In this way, precise gene editing and information storing can be achieved by utilizing the light system to regulate the dCas9-recombinase hybrid.In addition, the inducible ccdB system has other potential future applications.That is to say, we still count on the specificity and accuracy of recombinase, but meanwhile we need the assistance from Cas9.We established a model of the inducible ccdB system indicating the relationship between iPTG addition and OD value after discussing parameters of iPTG, ccdB, relative concentration of bacteria, and OD value measured.After successfully constructing all the systems required and confirming its efficacy, we can bridge the light-switchable TCS and the dCas9-recombines system together.CRISPR-Cas9 system is a newly developed gene-editing tool that breaks the limit of specific recognition sites.Consequently it is regarded as a complementary DNA cutter that is not restricted to recognize unique sequences, but is versatile that can recognize any sequence within the genome guided by its sgRNA.This means that if current information storage capacity is not enough, we do not need to search for a new recombinase, instead changing the sgRNA pairs can solve the problem.Engineering Escherichia colito see light[J].Therefore, if we have to choose one form of signal as the input, the optical input is favored [1].A pair of sgRNAs targeting the sense and antisense strand of the DNA sequence guide the fusion protein to the location, and the recombinase part of the fusion protein carries out deletion or inversion of the DNA segment.The blue light system follows similar principles, containing two components as well.Of course, it is easy to understand why we then turn to Cas9 and see if it can overcome the specificity issue from recombinase issue [6].There are two commonly used gene-editing tools: site-specific recombinase and CRISPR-Cas9 system.Following the guidance of sgRNAs, Cas9 endonuclease can be used to modify any site of the genome conveniently.Along ccdB\u0092s sequence we designed 25 and 24 sgRNAs targeting each strand of the DNA.However, accurate deletion or inversion, a vital aspect to consider when devising an information storing platform, are hard to accomplish because of double-strand breaks introduced by Cas9 endonuclease.With this new tool we don\u0092t need to bother considering and introducing recognition sites of the recombinases anymore.Also, without causing double-strand breaks, gene editing can be safer and more accurate [6].In other words, a major drawback of this information-storing platform is that every time a new recombinase has to be used when increasing the storing capability.[1] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].The response regulator is derived from OmpR of which the recognition site is a promoter named OmpC.Site-specific recombinase is an endonuclease that is capable of inserting, deleting and inverting a DNA fragment within the recognition site.In our system, three mainstream light systems we took advantage of all follow this basic scheme.Second, easy access and low cost renders light system frequently used.Effects of different designs of linkers are also tested using this inducible ccdB system.We built an inducible ccdB screening system for it.Refactoring and optimization of light-switchable Escherichia coli two-component systems[J].The sensor and the effector interact closely in order to give a precise light-induced response.Recombinases were previously utilized to accomplish information storage in biological systems due to its specificity [7].Although the screening work wasn\u0092t finished, a linker choice and distance between two sgRNAs worked finely.Three types of TCS are now the most commonly investigated, including red, blue and green light system, named by at which wavelength the system is responsive.Addition of iPTG induces expression of ccdB and then bacteria get killed, but if ccdB gene is successfully disrupted by dCas9 recombinase, then the bacteria survive.[7] Yang L, Nielsen A A

enabled them to exchange their preliminary ideas relevant to feasible iGEM projects.The most impressive part came when the representative of every group shared the amazing thoughts of their discussion, and those brave students were awarded with small souvenirs.The public we targeted to were mainly consisted of three groups listed below: students from other iGEM teams, freshmen from the School of Life Science in Tsinghua this year and some high school students who showed great interest in our project and daily experiment.Freshmen major in Biology always look forward to their research life in the future with enormous passion every year.At last, we received many reflections and encouragements written on the leaflet from them, which made us feel even more hopeful when thinking about future iGEM teams representing the School of Life Science in Tsinghua.In the light of this statement, we held an iGEM Mini-Jamboree on September 13th, 2015.In this way, efficient and harmonious communication between teams was realized while we got helpful advice at the same time.We decided to create a chance for high school students to experience experiments in the lab after we got to know their desire for practical attempt based on theoretical knowledge learned in class.Contacted successfully on May 18th, these senior three students from RDFZ visited the lab on May 24th for the first time.Several days in May and June spent in the lab with them, we introduced significant lab safety rules and basic molecular experiments.Xiao Yangbo and Zhao Yiqing, two of our team members, attended

GFP, will be expressed when bacteria carrying this plasmid are provided with blue light.Add gradients of 0.1% iPTG to bacteria suspension.In this experiment, we used a recombinase system to insert a Kanamycin gene into the genomic region where we want to target and then utilized other recombinase to remove the Kanamycin gene.For the red light system, we transformed a plasmid containing the entire red light system (Cph8, HO1 and PcyA), along with a promoter, a terminator and an OmpR regulated reporter.Therefore, when bacteria carrying this gene are provided with the red light, the reporter cannot be synthesized.The result supported this prediction because we can observe a distinctive expression pattern between the treated (provided with red light) and untreated (kept in dark) group.Eventually, we successfully fused two proteins with the seamless cloning, as is supported by the appearance of 4-5kb bands in nearly all lanes.In addition, we added a roughly 36bp linker between the two in order to increase its flexibility.As can be seen in Figure 3, roughly 1kb bands appear nearly in every lane, supporting that our knock-out system was effective.In this experiment, we planned to fuse two proteins, a recombinase and a Cas9, together.(c) Measure OD600 value of each dilution of the suspension, using liquid LB as blank.", "safety": "Before we started our project, all of our team members had received lab safety training, including standard experimental protocols, disposal of waste, information on hazardous chemicals and proper use of biosafety cabinets etc.The risks to team members were minimized by wearing appropriate PPEs in the lab all the time and following lab safety regulations of Tsinghua University.In order to avoid that problem, all members in the team were instructed of how to distribute and utilize this gene with specific orientation.Since that ccdB is an inhibitor of DNA gyrase and therefore interferes with normal bacterial activity, any improper disposal of ccdB protein and plasmids containing ccdB gene will pose serious results to the natural bacterial communities.In addition, since that ccdB is not harmful for human beings, it is trustworthy and safe to use this protein to kill the bacteria.In one of our experimental design, a lethal protein ccdB was used to screen for successful dCas9-recombinase hybrid design.Therefore, it\u0092s reasonable to conclude that our hardware is harmless.The E. coli we involved in the whole project was lab safe strain DH5?.", "keywords": "sofra-tulle artemisinin Northeastern dioxygenase

arabinose and tryptophan added during the recovery step and spread on the CM30 plate.Thus, we decided to order gBlock 2 of the same sequence from IDT company again.As we were unable to amplify gBlock 2, and the newly synthesized one was not yet arrived, the first Hi-Fi Assembly was done with the purified product of amplified gBlock 1, 3, 4, 5, and the original stock of gBlock 2.gBlock 1, 3, 4 all showed correct band size and the DNA concentration increased compared to the 1st PCR after gel extraction.gBlock 1 initiates with prefix and gblock 5 ends with suffix, thus after assembly with pSB1C3 backbone, the whole construct forms a circular plasmid and can be transformed into targeted organisms.While ordering the gBlock DNAs, we also designed and ordered the 10 forward and reverse primers that matched the 5 gBlocks respectively in order to amplify them through PCR.For the uncut plasmid, there were bands of 2000 bp, 4000 bp and 7000 bp, we wondered whether this was the result of supercoiling and circular form of the DNA which made it run faster in the gel, assuming the DNA was our HiFi product of around 9000 bp.The extract DNA after gel purification had a concentration of 12.1 ng/uL and 8.7 ng/uL.At the same time, we also tried to examine the band intensity of the PCR products of 5 gBlocks by running a 0.7% agarose gel.Both products were transformed into DH10B competent cells on CM30 plates with 10 uL of 20% arabinose stock and 10 uL of 0.1% tryptophan stock added on the plates, to prevent the activation of the killing switch system.Results were confirmed that only the positive control showed >30 colonies while HiFi product transformation failed.Since gBlock 1 and 3, after amplification, carried some overlapping region with the stock gBlock 2, there\u0092s still a possibility for successful Hi-Fi assembly.gBlock 1, 3, 4 and 5 were fine with the band size though some non-specific band is also shown.10 Bl21(DE3) plates and DH10B plates showing the result of the 3rd transformation of HiFi product Using the same HiFi product, transformation into DH10B was done again to ensure our construct could be cloned.We became more convinced that gBlock 2 was somehow degraded.We were almost desperate until the new gBlock 2 arrived on 14 Sep, using DMSO and Q5, we successfully amplified the new gBlock 2 with a correct band size after careful resuspension and sample handling.We thus ran a gel to test HiFi products and several bands instead of one single band were observed; this led to the conclusion that the gBlocks didn\u0092t make it to assemble to each other.8)PCR products of the 5 gBlocks were assembled in pSB1C3 and the HiFi products were immediately tested by running a 0.7% agarose gel.Since we could not gain correctly amplified gBlock 2, the original stock of it was run in agarose gel in order to identify the problem.Our whole construct was divided into 5 gBlock fragments and the gBlocks were ordered.We doubt whether the HiFi efficiency was too low so the whole product had a critically low concentration, or if we totally failed during HiFi assembly.5.As during the first transformation of Hi-Fi product we didn\u0092t add tryptophan and arabinose during the recovery state, there\u0092s a chance that DH10B might be killed by activated Cas 9 system when it first encountered the plasmids, leading to transformation failure.12) We\u0092re unable to explain such result and need more time in the future to dig out the reason.To avoid supercoiling of HiFi product for testing, we performed single digest cut using EcoRI to linearize the plasmid.6We wondered if the overlapping regions were too long for assembly of all PCR products of gBlocks that might affect efficiency of HiFi assembly.For the cut plasmid, there were 2 bands of 1000 bp and 2000 bp, rather than 4 expected bands (see Fig.This made us wonder what exactly our HiFi product is, as making it linear did not give a result of a band of 9000 bp.We had run the gel again using uncut HiFi product, and it shows fragments of 1000 bp, 3000 bp and 7000 bp.1 shows the span of the gBlock fragments and their length in base pair.Since the forward/ reverse primers have overlapping regions on the preceding/ following gBlocks, after amplification all fragments would have overlapping sequences that enable Hi-Fi assembly.And there were many colonies grown on the plate for BL21(DE3) while DH10B showed none (see Fig.Span of gBlock corresponding to the killing switch construct.The lowercase letters correspond to the overlapping sequences and the capital letters represent the annealing sequences of the adjacent gBlock fragments.For the detailed preparation and concentration of reaction agents, please refer to our Notebook page.For Tx, it is 3 degree Celsius higher than the lower Tm in that of the paired forward and reverse primers, to each gBlocks respectively.After the construction and optimization of our killing switch system that aims to work in E. coli BL21(DE3), we originally planned to use the BioBricks provided and start transformation and cloning.Our team was eager to know what might go wrong in the HiFi product sequence even though we did not have time to do so before the deadline.We had freeze-dried HiFi product after miniprep for composite part submission.We started PCR amplification after the arrival of both gBlocks and primers.Throughout 1-month transformation work, we did not have much ready-to-use BioBricks at the end.7 showed the band size of around 2000 bp reveals that this gBlock might give a chance for HiFi assembly again before the deadline.From the gel photo shown in Fig.We suspected that the competent cells or the HiFi products were contaminated with RFP prior to transformation.10 colonies from BL21(DE3) were picked and the cells were miniprepped.14 is the gel photo of the uncut plasmid.For detailed preparation and concentration of reaction agents, please see our Notebook page.A positive control was done along with the 1st Hi-Fi assembly.The sequences and working temperatures of each primers are provided in the table below.Gel purification for gBlock 1, 3, 4, 5 was done except for gBlock 5, and their DNA concentrations are low.To exclude this possibility, transformation was done again but with 0.02% arabinose and 0.001% tryptophan added during the recovery step.It was compared with the uncut one of the same product.Sequences of the 10 ordered forward and reverse primers.The concentration of the product ranged from 15.7 ng/uL to 61.5 ng/uL.PCR was performed once more for gBlock 1, 2, 3 and 4, but this time with DMSO added to eliminate any possible secondary structures that may account for gBlock amplification failure.In order to finish the project on time, we abandoned the cloning method and turned to gBlock, a synthetic double-stranded DNA product provided by IDT company.Since it is a big plasmid, details of the components could be found in the Registry page (BBa_K1774000).PCR reaction settings were the same as PCR 1st.For easy understanding, the length of DNA fragments in the figure are not in actual proportion.As expected, they were of correct band sizes and gBlock 2 and gBlock 4 had a lower intensity than others (see Fig.", "safety": "Also, since our lab work result in biological waste, the disposal of waste is carefully done under the required

biology.", "design": "Furthermore, the results of our survey showed that the majority would invest up to 20 minutes more in the washing process if that would allow using a more ecological product.Therefore, our improved laundry detergent could be of interest for costumers.As boric acid has been listed as a substance of very high concern and has even been proven to be toxic for reproduction, it might be banned from the markets soon.Furthermore, photocaging could reduce the amount of inhibitors needed and thus could be of high value in industrial processes.Concluding, photocaging could be easily transferred to other challenges if established once and thus provides a great opportunity not only for science but also for industry and medicine.To further investigate the challenges and opportunities of a photo-caged protease, we examined which effects it would cause if transferred into reality.As the dangers of boric acid are not yet widely known to the public, the need for an alternative way of inhibiting proteases and therefore the necessity of a newly developed laundry detergent might not be of obvious importance.In the following, we want to investigate how well our product approaches the initial problem of inhibiting proteases in laundry detergents in comparison to other solutions, depict the considerations why replacing boric acid is necessary and address further challenges that our project could help to overcome.Currently, there are many attempts to reversibly inactivate proteases like subtilisin E.Small molecules or peptides are being used as inhibitors.In the long term, the perfect solution would be a biotechnological production method through pathway engineering to generate the non-canonical amino acid directly inside the host.Although boric acid can be produced for a comparatively lower price, it will enter the sewages during the washing process.As our product would render the usage of boric acid in laundry detergents unnecessary, it would contribute to the process of limiting the danger to our environment.In the course of our project we also took in considerations how our product would be applied in reality.It works as a competitive inhibitor in the laundry detergent and as soon as the liquid is diluted in the washing machine, boric acid dissociate and the proteases become active again.In contrast to other solutions, boric acid can be produced chemically in bulk.Unfortunately, high amounts are needed to achieve an inactivation, as the boric acid has to compete with the substrate for the protease and is not covalently attached to it.The only change visible to the costumer could possibly be an increase in the prize of laundry detergents and also the need for the additional step of light-activation before the washing process.But as the common interest in ecological issues and eco-friendly alternatives rises, boric acid might not be tolerated by consumers anymore.A lot of different methods have been tried to inactivate proteases reversibly, but none of them showed the desired effect to a reasonable price.Though we are aware of the fact that our product is currently not the optimal answer to these demands, we are profoundly convinced that the method of photocaging enzymes could become the optimal solution.Until now, the future harms of boric acid in our environment can only be estimated approximately, but it has now become very obvious that strong regulations are needed to prohibit the further spread of the chemical.Hence, it is listed as a substance of very high concern by the European Chemicals Agency [4].Furthermore, as boric acid is flooded in the sewage system, it is able to enter the water cycle and thus spreads in the environment uncontrolled.This becomes even more alarming, as humans are exposed to boric acid in many different ways: Primarily, humans get in touch with boric acid during the process of washing clothes.But higher doses of it have been proven to be harmful to the environment and to humans and even toxic for fertility [2], [3].Therefore, photocaging has already been put to usage in intra-cellular studies [7]-[9] and as no toxicity occurred when the protection groups were cleaved of in vivo, can not only be applied in scientific research, but \u0096 with appropriate improvement - could also be used in medicine and even therapeutics.Currently, boric acid will not be filtered from the wastewater treatment plant [1] and therefore it accumulates in the water cycle.This does not seem to be a very big issue yet, as only small amounts of it are released during the washing process.With our photocaged protease, only one molecule of a photo-labile, non-canonical amino acid per enzyme would be needed.A. Lemke, D. Summerer, B. H. Geierstanger, S. M. Brittain, and P. G. Schultz, \u0093Control of protein phosphorylation with a genetically encoded photocaged amino acid,\u0094 Nat.However, many other photo-labile derivatives of the 20 canonical amino acids are currently in existence [6] and many more could be developed, if actual problems would occur with the existing one.As a consequence, peptide inhibitors are doomed to be destroyed by the protease that they are supposed to inactivate.A prominent example for a small molecule inhibitor for proteases is boric acid.Boric acid is widely used in laundry detergents to temporarily inactivate the containing proteases.While the method of photocaging develops, more and more harmless photo-labile protection groups for canonical amino acids will be designed.[7] D.

As a result, we concluded that within three days these cells are able to produce the native protease which will then digest the skim milk in the agar plates, resulting in a clearance.We were able to express subtilisin E in E. coli in amount high enough to be detected via skim milk assay.At first, we wanted to show that both the active site and the pro-peptide cleavage site of subtilisin E are essential for the activity of the enzyme.(picture)With the found concentrations we performed the same experiment but with both plasmids and antibiotics at the same time to find a proper concentration combination of both antibiotics.It was high enough to have an appropriate pressure on the cells, but was low enough, so that cultivation was possible in minimal medium.The growth on microtiter plates was as well evaluated via plate reader.Our chosen concentration where E. coli is growing and reliably keeps both plasmids can be found in the following list.Concentrations used in M9 solid medium with E. coli BL21 DE3 gold:Concentrations used in M9 liquid medium with E. coli BL21 DE3 gold:To get a maximum of colonies with transformation of the mutant library, the following tranformation methods were tested: A) co-transformation of both plasmids at the same time: reporter + tRNA/synthetase plasmid B) transformation of chemical competent cells (already hosting the reporter plasmid) with tRNA/synthetase plasmidConclusion: To have both plasmids in one cell, the best solution is the transformation of the tRNA/synthetase plasmid as PCR product (deriving from mutagenesis PCR) in competent cells which already contain the reporter plasmid pRXG.Thus it was decided to transfer competent cells directly into the tube during the process of transformation in E. coli DH5alpha.We made 5 ml LB + Amp overnight cultures of three different colonies grown on yesterday\u0092s transformation plates.We prepared cryo cultures with 1 ml of yesterday\u00b4s overnights and isolated the plasmids from the remaining culture.We measured the concentration of the isolated plasmids:The plasmid was digested with EcoRI and checked on an agarose gel.We prepared competent cells out of a Saccharomyces CENPK21D strandTransformation of pESCTrpLeuRSBH5T252A into Saccharomyces CerevisiaeWe transformed pESCTrpLeuRSBH5T252A into an Uracil and Tryptophan deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strand (CENPK21D).The transformation grew but at the control plates where untransformed competent cells where plated on SD-Trp medium also a few colonies grew with no obvious reason.5 ml Overnight cultures of 5 of the cultures derived from the transformations two days ago were made in SD-U medium with ampicillin.All controls were correct.We prepared cryo cultures of the overnight cultures of SDM 1, 3 and 4 in E. coli BL21 and isolated the plasmids from the cells to use them for further experiments.PCR-amplified insert (column 1-12), DNA ladder #SM0312.As all samples showed the correct size, the DNA concentration was increased by purification of multiple samples through one column during PCR clean-up.In addition to this, multiple overnight cultures of 5 mL were prepared with the plates of the transformation from BBa_J04450 in E. coli BL21 from the day before.All controls were correct.We prepared cryo cultures of the overnight cultures of SDM 2 in E. coli BL21 and isolated the plasmids from the cells.All controls were correct.Cryo cultures of the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair in E. coli BL21 were prepared and we isolated the plasmids from the cells.As a consequence, these cells can be used for further experiments.Continuing the transfer to liquid minimal media, we prepared 5ml overnight cultures with the positive clones from the M9 agar plates in liquid M9 medium.Figure 3: Increase in area under curve for peak at 5.22 minutes.Also based on similar measurements, we observed a decrease in area for the peak at 19.02 minutes, indicating the presence and decrease in the concentration of ONBY (figure 4).Figure 4: Decrease in area under curve for peak at 19.02 minutes.As a conclusion, we deduced that the amount of cleavage product increases as the exposure time is extended.We intended to use the results of the ONBY photocleavage characterization to irradiate our samples S221X- and Y77X-mutated proteases which were obtained through cultivation of the SDM 2 and SDM 4-modified expression system in E. coli BL21.Overnights of two colonies from yesterday\u0092s transformation were made.We made cryo cultures from yesterday\u0092s overnights and isolated plasmids from the remaining culture.The concentration of the isolated plasmids was measured with a nanodrop:We to cut the samples 2a-4b plus the control vectors with confirmed sequence with EcoRI.Oddly, the agarose gel shows that the plasmids are not at the expected size.We sent the original plasmids for sequencing with primers YP0022 and YP0023, that bind to the respective promotors and primers to find out the sequence of the plasmid, as this was not given to us along with the plasmid.We isolated the plasmids of the quikchanged subtilisin E in pTEF-MF overnights.We measured the concentration of isolated plasmids via nanodrop: We sent the four samples of isolated plasmids in for sequencing with YP0007, YP0008 and YP0009.We did not continue after this step as the subtilisin E expression did not work.As our previous efforts did not produce usable results, we did not reach this point.In order to incorporate our DMNB-serine into the protease we aim to produce, we have to provide the organism with an orthogonal tRNA/Synthetase pair specific for this non canonical amino acid.The plasmids were isolated and sent for sequencing.The cryo cultures were then used to inoculate precultures and prepare chemical competent cells according to the protocol.The growth of E. coli cells transformed with plasmids containing wild type tyrosyl-tRNA/synthetase and oNBY-tRNA/synthetase on LB solid as well as in LB liquid is not affected by concentrations of gentamicin up to 30 \u00b5g/ml, whereas a wild type E. coli BL21 DE3 gold is affected already at 5 \u00b5g/ml.All controls were correct.We prepared cryo cultures of the overnight cultures of the ligation product in E. coli BL21 and isolated the plasmids from the cells.Therefore, we poured LB skim milk agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotic and streaked the E. coli BL21 cells containing the plasmid with the expression system.Figure 1: Skim milk plates assay.At first, we prepared cryo cultures of the overnight cultures and then isolated the plasmids from the cells.In the following we executed a co-transformation in E. coli BL21: SDM 2-modified expression system and ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pairSDM 4-modified expression system and ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pairDuring the transformation 2\u00b5l of each plasmid sample were used and the cells were plated on LB agar plates with two antibiotics.Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain any clear results from the SDS gel and thus could not verify the expression of subtilisin E. We continued our experiments by performing a skim milk assay on agar plates.Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain any clear results from the SDS gel and thus could not verify the expression of subtilisin E.As we were not able to detect the expression of the modified proteases via SDS gel, we proceeded by executing a skim milk assay on agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotics.As controls, overnight cultures with E. coli BL21 wildtype were prepared, with and also without addition of antibiotic.Figure 7: Results of the overnight cultures.The sequencing results showed that in some samples we successfully modified our expression system with the desired mutations.In the following we wanted to analyze the expression level of the different, mutated versions of subtilisin E. To express a photocaged enzyme not only a stop codon at the target site is needed but also an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair that incorporates the desired non-canonical amino acid in response to the amber stop codon.Combined with the experience of other iGEM teams that the promoter BBa_R0011 shows some degree of expression before the addition of the inducer, we assumed that subtilisin E prohibits cell growth of E. coli if expressed in its active form.As a result, we progressed by exchanging the promoter.To exchange to promoter of our expression system, we started with extracting parts of it via PCR.All controls were correct.To find a successfully ligated plasmid, we screened 24 colonies via Colony PCR with primers that bind outside of the insert to pSB1C3 and in parallel prepared overnight cultures of the same colonies.It is a size based sorting method.In the pTEF-MF the secretion tag MFalpha should lead to a secretion.We tested the supernatant of 24 h, 48 h and 72 h cultures with the methods described above but did not get any positive results.We also crushed the cells to test them with the same methods after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h but there was no positive result either.Subtilisin E expression was not possible in this expression system.In the pyes2 vector with additional MFalpha secretion tag Subtilsin E also should be secreted.The expected size is 7 700 bp.There are clear bands at all the six annealing temperatures, so the PCR worked well.We did a DpnI digestion overnight of the quik change products.We made a PCR-clean-up of the DpnI digested products to prepare them for transformation in E. coli Dh5alpha.We transformed the purified SDM product into E. coli DH5 alpha and plated them on LB + Amp plates.The expression system consists of commonly used BioBricks:Figure 1: Visualization of the system designed for the expression of subtilisin E in E. coliThis construct was ordered at IDT as a gblock and named \u0091EI0002\u0092.We decided to use the pSB1C3-backbone from iGEM.Since the cells showed a proper growth rate in LB with 30 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin + 50 \u00b5g/ml kanamycin when transformed with a reporter plasmid and a synthetase plasmid the assessed concentrations are kept.Figure 1: antibiotics test - growth on plates with gentamicin in concentrations: 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 \u00b5g/mlDetermining Concentration of Antibiotics in M9 Minimal MediumBy cultivation of cells transformed with one of the two types of plasmids (antibiotic resistances: kanamycin/gentamicin) and incubating on plates with different antibiotics concentrations the correct working concentrations were found.Hence, we streaked the same colonies that we used for the overnight cultures on M9 agar plates.Thus, we planned to simulate the incorporation of ONBY and DMNBS by exchanging both amino acids at the target sites against bigger amino acids and then to analyze the activity of the mutated enzyme as a proof of principle.Our second goal was to mutate our current expression system in order to exchange serine in the active site and tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site against the UAG amber stop codon in preparation for the expression of a photocaged enzyme.All controls were correct.To back up the co-transformed cells in M9 medium we prepared cryo cultures of the overnight cultures.As the cells were able to grow in medium with two antibiotics, both plasmids must have been successfully transformed into them.Hence, we used the primers shown below to obtain a sequence with the secretion tag, the subtilisin E gene and a terminator that is flanked by the BioBrick prefix and suffix.In addition, we prepared pre-cultures of the E. coli BL21 wildtype and the pSB1C3 empty backbone in E. coli BL21 as controls.All controls were correct.Multiple 5ml overnight cultures were prepared for each SDM approach together with all needed controls.Figure 3: Results of the overnight cultures.Figure 2: Results of the overnight cultures.In the following, we linearized the purified plasmids with EcoRI and tested their size via agarose-gelelectrophoresis.Figure 14: Agarose gel picture of expression system with new promoter.A scheme of the cloning can be seen below: Figure 1: Scheme of cloning the Bacillus gene for subtilisin E into pTEF-MF  Cloning of Codon Optimized Subtilisin E in pTEF-MFAs the test expression of the Subtilisin E gene from bacillus subtilis was not successful we used a codon optimized variant of the gene we had on the PHY300PKL plasmid.By demonstrating that this modification doesn\u0092t result in a clearance of the skim milk plates, we were now able to prove that serine is essential for the proteolytic activity of the protease and that exchanging it would inactivate the enzyme.* needs to have the deficiencies of both chosen vectorsThe lab of Peter G. Schultz kindly sent us the plasmid carrying the genes for the tRNA/Synthetase pair (pESCTrpLeuRSBH5T252A) orthogonal in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and capable of integration the photolabile unnatural amino acid 4,5-Dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl-serine.Here we introduced the tRNA/synthetase plasmid into the organism we sought to express subtilisin E in, in order to be able to integrate the noncanonical amino acid into the protease .For all agarose gels we used 1% agarose and 1kb Thermo scientific ladder 08Unfortunately, the tube was open upon receipt and no traces of dried DNA material were visible.As we are still dealing with challenges of the previous step, we did not yet continue to this point.As our previous efforts did not produce usable results, we did not reach this point.As our previous efforts did not produce usable results, we did not reach this point.As our previous efforts did not produce usable results, we did not reach this point.Photocaging - Targeting Tyrosine in Escherichia coli Our aim here was to express the natural subtilisin E in E. coli and to determine the optimal conditions.Our aim was to create a functional expression system for subtilisin E in Escherichia coli.The native subtilisin E is a gene of Bacillus subtilis which we could receive from the institute.One of the samples of the PCR extracted expression system in BBa_J04500 that was sequenced beforehand and also the sample with the empty backbone showed the correct sequence and could therefore be used for further experiments.In preparation for the expression of a photocaged enzyme we exchanged the codons for the targeted amino acids against the UAG amber stop codon.To achieve this, we simultaneously performed the site-directed mutagenesis three times (SDM 1, 3 and 4) with fitting primers and our expression system after the exchange of promoters as a template.Figure 11: Extraction of a part of the expression system via PCR.Afterwards, we cloned this sequence in the BioBrick BBa_J04500 with the restriction sites EcoRI and PstI.Provided by Irina Borodina, Technical University of DenmarkAfter cloning the subtilisin E into the vectors pTEF-MF, pyes2 and the genome integration vector pCfB255 [1] a test expression was made.At first, we had to optimize the sequence of the subtilisin E gene from Bacillus subtilis for Escherichia coli codon usage.Figure 5: Results of the overnight cultures.Figure 11: Results of the overnight cultures.Figure 6: Results of the overnight cultures.Either frameshifts in the coding sequence or multiple deletions in the promoter occurred.Despite repeating the experiment above multiple times, we were not able to obtain an expression system for subtilisin E without fatal mutations.After cloning the subtilisin E gene into the vector in Escherichia coli we want to transform it in S. cerevisiae and make a test expression.The sequencing results showed that we were able to obtain samples with the desired, modified sequence.A scheme of the cloning can be seen below:Figure 1: scheme of cloning the codon optimized gene for subtilisin E with MFalpha into pYES2After codon optimization we planned to have the subtilisin E inside an integrative vector pCFB255 [1] for better expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae[1]Jensen et al.All controls were correct.We prepared cryo cultures of the overnights of the empty backbone and purified the plasmids from the cells.Consequently, tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site is not essential for the activity of subtilisin E. We were able to proof that serine in the active site would result in a loss of activity.All controls were correct.We prepared multiple 5ml overnight cultures of each co-transformation together with the needed controls.DNA ladder #SM0312.As all samples showed the correct size, identical samples were purified through one column during PCR clean-up to increase the DNA concentration.After that, the DpnI digest was set up and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight.We performed a heatkill with the DpnI-digested samples of SDM 2.After that, the samples were ligated for one hour at room temperature and then transformed into E. coli BL21.All controls were correct.We prepared 5ml overnight cultures of the colonies and the usual controls.Figure 13: Results of the overnight cultures.Unfortunately, we were not able to prove the principle of our project regarding tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site, as it seems to be not essential for the proteolytic activity.As an alternate first step the yeast cell walls were lysed with beads by vortexing cultures in buffer with them for 30 minutes instead of the bacterial lysis buffer.We measured the concentration of the isolated plasmids: The isolated plasmids were digested with EcoRI and put on a gel.Positive clones can be seen in column 3, 4 and 5.The samples with the correct size were sent in for sequencing.For the analysis of the expression level we needed an empty backbone control.Only white colonies were used for the preparation of 5ml overnight cultures.Photocaging - Targeting Serine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae As the first step to reach our aim of producing an inactive photocaged subtilisin E variant, which can be activated by light, we researched on the recombinant expression of subtilisin E in S. cerevisiae .PCR-amplified insert (column 1-12), DNA ladder #SM0312, positive clones can be seen at the top in column 1, 11 and 12A few colonies showed the correct size and were therefore used for further experiments.Cells producing the native protease (picture A-C, left) in comparison to either cells containing the empty backbone (picture A, right) or cells carrying the SDM 3-modified (picture B, right) and the SDM 1-modified expression system (picture C, right) after incubation for 3 days at 30\u00b0C.Neither the empty backbone nor the SDM 1-modified expression system did seem to cause a proteolytic activity.We took one sample of each main-culture from the day before and then lysed all samples in a sonication bath for about 30 minutes.But as we were able to prove the concept of our project, we will not only show our progress so far but also our plans for the experiments that we weren t able to conduct.To characterize O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-L-tyrosine (ONBY), we decided to test the photocleavage with the light box provided by the iGEM team D\u00fcsseldorf 2016 and to analyze it, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).While targeting the pro-peptide cleavage site, we wanted to use the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair for E. coli which derives from the tyrosyl-tRNA/synthetase pair from Methanococcus janaschii.We prepared cryo cultures with 1 ml of yesterday\u00b4s overnights and isolated the plasmids from the remaining culture.Afterwards, we checked the size of the plasmids via agarose-gelelectrophoresis.Via SDM 1 we exchanged the targeted serine in the active site against a bigger amino acid, namely tyrosine.Provided by Irina Borodina, Technical University of Denmark Cloning of Subtilisin E Gene from Bacillus subtilis into an E. coli - S. cerevisiae Shuttle VectorIn the beginning we received the PHY300PKL plasmid with the subtilisin E gene.In the following, we proceeded to design the expression system digitally.As the transfer from the solid complex medium to liquid minimal medium causes a high stress-level for the E. coli cells, we intended to change at first from solid complex medium to solid minimal medium and then to liquid minimal medium.The overnight cultures of all negative colonies were discarded.Figure 10: Results of the overnight cultures.* needs to have the deficiencies of both chosen vectorsWe tested the growth in different temperatures for optimization:As our CENPK2-1D strand was growing poorly in the SC-U medium, we got the advice to try the same medium but with a higher amount of amino acids (SD-U).After OD measurements it was obvious, that the SD-U medium gave the CENPK2-1D better conditions for growthTo prevent bacterial contaminations, we made a comparison of the growth of our used strand in medium with and without ampicillin.A scheme of the cloning can be seen below:Figure 1: scheme of cloning the codon optimized gene for subtilisin E into pTEF-MF After day 10 of cloning the codon optimized subtilisin E into pTEF-MF we tried a parallel strategy in the PYES2 vector.As seen on the pictures above, a clearance has occurred for those modified cells and a proteolytic activity could be assumed.To achieve this, we dissolved 5mg of ONBY powder in 100\u00b5l pyridine and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes.Then, the analysis was executed via GC-MS with the following conditions:Injection Temperature: 80\u00b0C; Holding Time: 2 minutes The sample was then exposed to UV light of intensity 14.8 mW/cm2 with different exposure time of 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes using the light box and then analyzed using the same GC-MS method described above.After having tested the growth on plates we cultivated the cells in liquid medium with the same antibiotics concentrations to also check it under this conditions.For this determination we evaluated the growth on the plates and in the test tubes.To make sure the cells kept the plasmids we performed a colony PCR (plates) or plasmid isolation (liquid) followed by gel electrophoresis.Furthermore, we planned to perform a skim milk assay with these samples before and after irradiation and then the degradation efficiencies of the proteases were compared by the extent of clearance.As template we used 1\u00b5l of sequenced subtilisin E in pTEF-MF (day 14 from cloning of subtilisin E gene from Bacillus subtilis) with a concentration of 13,6 ng/\u00b5l per 50 \u00b5l reaction.We made an agarose gel to see if our modified subtilsin E was amplified with the primers.A clearance and therefore a proteolytic activity could only be observed for the native protease (as demonstrated before) and the SDM 3-modified expression system.We made overnight cultures of 4 of the grown colonies in 5 ml LB + Ampicillin.To analyze the expression level of subtilisin E we prepared 20ml pre-cultures of the positive sample.One sample was sent in for sequencing.The sequencing results showed that the sample had the correct sequence and could therefore be used in further experiments.We used the following methods to test for proteolytic activity:The skim milk assay is a non specific test for proteolytic activity.We took five identical samples of each main-culture from the day before and then lysed all samples with different cell lysis methods: Lysozyme solution (1h, 37\u00b0C, 250 rpm) + sonication bath (30 minutes) The supernatant of these samples was then tested via SDS-gelelectrophoresis.With these we also sequenced.The sequencing revealed that we did not have the plasmid we expected, as the primers did not bind.In our working strain E. coli BL21 DE3 gold the release factor 1 competes with the tRNA loaded with the ncAA.The samples were tested via agarose-gelelectrophoresis after the PCR.SDM 3 has been executed to exchange tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site against tryptophan, a bigger amino acid.In the beginning we performed a heatkill with the DpnI-digested samples of SDM 1, 3 and 4.Moreover, the experiments to test the incorporation efficiency of the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair showed that this pair is also able to incorporate DMNB-serine to a certain degree.Picture taken from the RegistryThe ordered DNA sequence EI0002 was resuspended to a concentration of 20 ng/\u00b5L and amplified via PCR with the primers shown below.This means, that the plasmids for both our expression system and the tRNA/synthetase-pair have the same origin of replication and therefore are competing against each other in terms of which of them will be replicated.BBa_J04500 is a protein expression backbone which consists of the lacI promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome-binding site BBa_B0034 integrated in the BioBrick standard vector pSB1C3.Decision to work with kit from iGEM Team Austin, Texas 2014The development of a screening system, which was needed to test for the activity of a synthetase incorporating a ncAA, is a difficult and time consuming task.They sent us the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair in a backbone that carries a gentamicin resistance and is replicated with an ori that is not part of the same incompatibility group as the ori of pSB1C3.Figure 1: Schematic representation of the recieved tRNA/synthetase pair in its backbone.Compared to co-transformation, the number of cells is higher by a factor of 10.Both clones are positive.One of the samples that showed the correct size was sent in for sequencing.For industry secretion is a big advantage as it allow continuous productionFor amplifying the vector easily it needs to have an ori and selective marker in E. colidifferent than the selection of synthetase plasmid which is tryptophane auxotrophy[2]Jensen et al.We observed that, as the exposure time was incremented from 1 minutes to 10 minutes (figure 1, graph C-F), the intensity of the peak also amplified indicating an increase in the amount of cleavage product.The chromatogram of the analyzed samples shows the appearance of a peak at 5.22 minutes close to the expected elution time of 5.3 minutes.Figure 3: Agarose gel picture of the empty backbone pSB1C3 (column 1-2).All controls were prepared according to the protocol.Figure 8: Transformation results.The supernatant and the pellet of these samples were then tested separately via SDS-gelelectrophoresis.Figure 1: Chromatograms of the analysis via GC-MS of ONBY.Also, these cultures had to be handled in the dark after addition of the non-canonical amino acids due to their light-sensitivity.Figure 6: Overview of addition of non-canonical amino acids to the main-cultures.All main-cultures were inoculated to an OD600 of 0.1 and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 250 rpm to OD600 0.3.As transformation on LB solid with subsequent picking in M9 liquid resulted in almost no growth, proper cell growth is achieved by the following method:Pick into M9 liquid: Masterplate, growth: 2 days at 30\u00b0C, 900rpm,Replicate into M9 liquid Screening plate, growth 2 days at 30\u00b0C, 900 rpmCryo cultures are made from all intermediate steps.DMNBS is soluble in 50% DMSO at basic pH.After that, the DpnI digest was set up and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight.All main-cultures were prepared with the same medium as the pre-culture.Still enough proteins with the amber as a stop codon are expressed funtionally.To the cultures with minimal medium we added the non-canonical amino acid solved in 50% DMSO.Fortunately, we were able to contact members of the former iGEM team Texas, Austin from 2014 who originally created the part BBa_K1416000.However, due to the unavailability of standard 2-nitroso benzaldehyde, we could not quantify the amount of cleaved product produced on UV exposure.This was only possible due to a re-ligation of the RFP-expression cassette into pSB1C3.Both samples were digested with the enzymes EcoRI and PstI.After incubation for 10 minutes, we used 2\u00b5l for a transformation in E. coli BL21 and in parallel transformed the usual controls.Figure 2: Transformation

correct.Some colonies of the ligation product appeared to be pink.We then proceeded to prepare two 50ml main-cultures for each pre-culture from the day before.The pre-cultures from the day before were used to inoculate two 50ml main-cultures each to an OD600 of 0.1.A rough estimate of the change in concentration was made by measuring the area under the curve for the peak at 5.22 minutes (figure

TEMED will solidify the solution very fast.should include: a tank, lid with power cables, electrode assembly, cell buffer dam,  casting stands, casting frames, combs(usually 10-well or 15-well), and glass plates (a thin glass plate and a thicker one).The SDS PAGE gel in a single electrophoresis run can be divided into stacking gel and separating gel.. Stacking gel is poured on top  of the separating gel (after solidification) and a gel comb is inserted in the stacking gel.And be noticed that TEMED smells very bad, so use it fast and close the bottle rapidly.Let the stacking gel solidifying by following the same procedure from the protocol above.Note: Make sure a complete gelation of the stacking gel and take out the comb.Take the glass plates out of the casting frame and set them in the cell buffer dam.Pour the running buffer (electrophoresis buffer) into the inner chamber and keep pouring after overflow untill the buffer surface reaches the required level in the outer chamber.In this case, add an additional amount of alkali to reach the target pH range.Pick a bit of cell material of colony with a pipette tip and put it in a PCR tube with 50 \u00b5L of the reagent.And be noticed that TEMED smells very bad, so use it fast and close the bottle rapidly.After making the separation gel solution should be filled between the two glass plates until it reaches the mark of the casting frame.You can straighten the surface by adding a thin layer of isopropanol to your separation gel.Keep the rest of your solution in the small beaker for cheaking the solidification of your separation gel.For a separating gel posessing higher percentage of acylamide, the time will be longer.This assay is suitable for library screening in microtiterplates.Fill up the mixture to a volume of 500mL with ddH2O.Stir for 2 minutes and directly start the reaction.Load 5-10 \u00b5L of enzyme solution in a 96-well flat bottom microtiter plate.[7] Add 5 \u00b5l NEB bufferand 1 \u00b5l DpnI to the 45 \u00b5l purified PCR product.Purify the PCR products with the PCR Purification Kit and elute in 30-50\u00b5l NE buffer.Resuspend the pellet in 100-200 ?l of SDS Sample Buffer.Centrifuge the samples for 4 min at 4\u00b0C and 14000 rpm.Add 150 \u00b5L buffer on the pellet, resuspend it (e.g.Put the used running buffer into the used running buffer beaker for further usage.Staining the gel with staining solution for 10-15 min.Perform the first destaining with the used destanng solution to for 15 min, pour back to the used destaning solution afterwards.Perform the second destaining with the fresh destaining solution and destain for 20-30 min.After the separation gel is solidified, the isopropanol should be discarded.Note: Efficiency can be increased by purification of the PCR-product before Dpnl digestion, especially when Phusion from NEB was used.The purified PCR products will be transformed into competent cells.If desired, KOH can be substituted by NaOH in the reagent.Afterwards pour back to the used destaining solution bottle.Use storage solution to destain for 1-2h, then discard the solution.", "result": "\"HSiTAIWAN\"Biosensor for Toxin in Chinese Herb Medicine\"Please enable JavaScript in your browser to view results.Imperial College \"Ecolibrium - developing a framework for engineering co-cultures\" Sydney Australia \"FRES(H)\" - a fruit ripeness detector\"  SCAU-China \"aSTARice -- astaxanthin biosynthesis in rice endosperm\"Wageningen UR\"Saving honeybees from Varroa destructor: arming bacteria with targeted and specific toxin production against mites.", "safety": "There should be at least one person from the lab, who is not part of the iGEM team.Disinfect hands and wash them after working in the lab.Furthermore our project includes the handling of non-canonical amino acids, which we treat according to their special requirements.Laws and regulations regarding biosafety in germanyGesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik: Bundesgesetzblatt (year 2010, page 1934, in german)Biostoffverordnung: Bundesgesetzblatt (year 2013, page 2514, in german)[1]R.

In this scenario 0.1 g of boric acid or 7 ng of DMNB or 4.9 ng of ONB remain in the laundry.While there are 16 mmol boric acid per kg laundry detergent the concentration of the photocaged amino acid is only 3,6 nmoles per kg.As organic compounds they could most likely be filtered by active charcoal and others whereby human exposure by the drinking water can be excluded.Boric acid reacts with the polyhydroxyl ribitol side chain of riboflavin.The diluted compounds of washing detergents end up in the waste water and consequently in the waste water treatment plant.[5]European Chemicals Bureau, \u0093IUCLID Dataset for Boric Acid\u0094, 2000 CD-ROM edition, p.26, Oct.Example for one washing cycle (100 g liquid laundry detergent)For this calculation we assume that 1% of the liquid detergent stays in the laundry after washing and the composition is like in the calculation above.So we reduce those risks by fulfilling safety level 1 procedures as seen below.All biological materials (including genetically modified organism (abbreviation GMO)) or equipment, that was used for handling, is collected separately and autoclaved.Closed boxes are used for transportation between labs but if possible, transportation between labs should be avoided.If lab coats or clothes start burning, use emergency showers.If acids or other harmful liquids get into the eyes, use eye showers.If injuries occurred, treat them with first aid-kits, report the injury, and go to the hospital if necessary.If solutions with GMO is running down the bench (or other kinds of contamination), swap it and disinfect the place with Bacillol.Safety glasses are mandatory in special areas of the lab and should be used in other areas if necessary.Usage of safety gloves are mandatory in special areas of the lab and should be used depending on the working materials.Do not work alone.[9]To avoid the risks of the nitrosobenzyl derivatives there are a lot of different photo protection groups, which could be used instead of the ONB and DMNB.For every photocaged molecule of amino acid one molecule of protection group exits.The common liquid laundry detergent contains 0.5\u00a0-\u00a01% (w/w) of boric acid and 0.00005\u00a0-\u00a00.0001% (w/w) active protease.Waterborne substances like boric acid, which cannot be filtered out in purification plants expose consumers via their drinking water.In order to evaluate the safety of our LIPs, we made a toxicological assessment, considering how humans and the environment could be affected when getting in touch with it and how probable an exposure is.This increases its water solubility and reduces the amount of available riboflavin in animals and humans [3]Boric acid is classified as substance of very high concern [6] and is toxic for fertility.Approximate predictions can be made through known data about similar chemicals as other nitroso compounds.Nitrosobenzene reacts in the human blood circulation with hemoglobin and minimizes its ability of O2 uptake.We collected all data we could on the substance we want to replace.E.
