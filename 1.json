project.provided ZJU-China and some other iGEM teams with the chance to show our project to the public, the show can be regarded as one part of our human practice.Dr. Yu helped us with the CNC part including characterization of CNC, operation of equipment and assistant analysis.who is in charge of the lab in which we worked helped us a lot with daily experiment work, keeping the whole lab in order.from Shandong University provided us with the vital and precious strain TT01, which contains genes called tcdA1 and tcdB1.of Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum gave us the opportunity to publicize our project as well as synthetic biology.The main part of the project was finished by the 15 students from ZJU-China iGEM team.an overgraduate student in College of Agriculture and Biotechnology helped us finish the termite simulation experiments including (Cellulase and lysozyme activity measurement, toxic bacteria feeding experiment, trophallaxis verification, avermectin detection in trophallaxis ect.)A professor at CAU pointed out some mistakes in our project and offered us numerous constructive advices to improve our method of avermectin manufacture.We also performed some social research for human practice, we went to communities and areas where the termite problem is serious.Owing to the effort we\u0092ve made for outreach, we got the chance to collaborate with ZJSTM and made great preparation for human practice.", "background": "", "description": "According to incomplete statistics, all over the world, the annual expenditure of termites control exceeds a billion dollars.IGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015 has created TERMITE TERMINATOR, a genetically modified toxins expression system with a delivery carrier cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , capable of trapping termites based on their trophallaxis, and then kill the whole nest.We choose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites.Following the instruction, they open the outer shell, put the box of food inside, spread some water on the surface of the food, and place the device in a corner where is dark, damp and termites can be seen.But if the damage is due to termites, repairing will be only a temporary protection.The ZJUTT (ZJU TERMITE TERMINATOR) sees this problem and therefore cooperates with the ancient building protection department.As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people  houses, we can bring the result of the project into production.As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people  houses, we can bring the result of the project into production.With the monitor, precaution can be taken and use ZJUTT devices kill termites before they cause any damage.Under the dazzling sunshine of summer, students are sweating, reading their textbooks.When 3 months pass and there are nearly no termites, take out the food box form the device and burn the rest food if possible.Termites are not only in school but also in people s houses.What s more annoying is that, the termites are also coming!It really influences public safety and people\u0091s life in a negative way.Because of the photophobic habit of termites, they always move in a covert condition.They are always one of the toughest problem for those forest keepers.In order to get rid of termites in the whole economic forest region, the forest protection agency contact ZJUTT.What s more, termites have tenacious vitality and will soon spread through the forest.Simply placing the drugs that will kill the termites is also a way we might use when locating the nest is quite impossible or the nest is quite dispersed.However, the drug used in this way is toxic to many species other than termites, and will produces much ecological pressure consequently.The special hazardous way of termites makes people ignore their invasion at the early time.Termites will die after feeding in the trap.This habit also makes termites one the city pests, which are the most difficult and expensive to control.First, termites have the strong adaptability and viability.Every summer, the termites are flying all around.Finally, the termites disappear from the region.The other is that, the holes left by termites crawling could affect the integrity and security of buildings, dams and trees.Termites are widely recognized as the fifth pest around the world, based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards woods and infrastructure.Sometimes we can do precautions by pesticide application or by reinforcing the buildings that might suffer from the termites.Walk in the supermarket and pick up the household type termites killing device produced by ZJUTT.If the termites are convicted by the technicians, termites control shoold be applied first to eliminate the future danger.What\u0091s more, the hazards caused by termites to communal facilities such as large reinforced concrete bridges, gas lines, are frequently reported these years.Taking the Coptotermes formosanus as an example, which is the most harmful termite around the world; however this species once only distributed in several regions, such as Chinese mainland and Taiwan province.With the transportation of massive supplies in World War II, these termites  distribution range has gradually enlarged.In the following ten years, if possible, it could acheive mass production of TERMITE TERMINATOR and could be widely used with our designed devices.Separately over expressed in E.coli and another host, toxins were then delivered to the termites by the cell carrier.We expect that the drug will attach to the termite and be carried back to the nest, then the whole nest of termite can be killed for one time.Account for the effect of warm wet air current from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, many provinces with warm climate, plentiful water and abundant vegetation own special preferences for termites.Thus, there is a group of people working in the forest protection agency to take care of these trees.In the breeding heyday, a mature termite queen s daily oviposition is over ten thousand.Termite is an ancient social insect in the world for about 0.13 billion years.According to the above result, Zhejiang is one of the most regions of termite occupation and plagued by them.In mainland China, Coptotermes formosanus is the kind of species doing harm to housing constructions even on 20 floors; woods; communication facilities ect.It can be absorbed through and damage the mucous membranes; also harmful to the kidneys and liver.Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.With the map and other information that the agency provided, ZJUTT will draw up a plan with the optimum locations for killing devices placement.Although application with a garden hose and sprayer is relatively easy, gardeners can t simply apply nematodes to the landscape whenever they feel like it and expect them to work.As for rural country housing and landacaping? Coptotermes formosanus is the main species.Devices will be taken back to the company for sterilization and reuse.This is really a staggering number and it is the fact.As for urban housing, Reticulitermes speratus is the main species followed by Coptotermes formosanus.We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs.We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs.2013 reported in the literature, 371 destructive termite species occupy 12.5% of current total species.One is that termites take materials rich in lignocellulose as food, which causes property damage to human beings.Given that a termite weighed 1 gram, then everyone around the world should own about 500 thousand termites!Calcolated amount of food have been beforehand put into the device.Apply nematodes at dawn or dusk, because high levels of ultraviolet rays from the sun can kill them.You need to use live nematodes as soon as possible for maximum efficacy, because they have a limited shelf life.But the cost could be huge and in many cases we don t have ways to determine the range of the precautions.If they become dry, they could die.Nematodes do their work under the soil surface, gardeners don t see dead insect bodies, making efficacy hard to measure.According to the experimental results of computer simulation, average per person holds 0.5 tons of termite resources.They are now filling nearly every corner of the globe, from tropical regions to subtropical ones, which occupies 50% of the earth s area.It requires a lot of human cost in the early days.They may live in the interlayer of ceiling, walls or wood floor, eating your clothes, books and furniture.Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device with the function of monitoring and terminating for better achieving.Tree keepers together with company technicians will bring the device to the place.We decided to have the carrier for: reducing the loss; improving transport efficiency; targeting the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment to some extent.When repairing is needed, ZJUTT technicians will show up first, rather than the maintenance worker.Adequate moisture is the most important -- nematodes need water to move and find host insects.Technical staff will go to the forest for field trips to evaluate the severity.The spawning of one year reaches up to five hundred millions.Third, termites could achieve different-distance spread and distribution by virtue of flight spread, pervasive invasion and factitious carry, owning to their strong transmission capacity.The propagation of termites sometimes results in wide spread of termites  harm.These devices are used to attract termites to check if there is any new hidden termites nest.It is reported that, the direct loss induced by termites is beyond 220 billion dollars per year.These are very small unsegmented worm species which search for hosts, like termites, and burrow into them, causing death within approximately 48 hours.He advise the school stuff to buy a few small size termites killing devices from ZJUTT.Open the package and put it at places where termites can be seen.But what make them stressfol is that the forest regions are always inhabited by termites.Factory is the base and during improvements as well as experiments, social users data is collected for further promotion and perfection.There are termites all over the five continents.The harm that termites bring to human mainly reflects in two aspects.In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents.In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents.It often takes a long time from termites invasion to being discovered.Trees that destroyed by termites will lost their economic value.At present this kind of termites has caused serious damages in numerous countries and regions, turning into cosmopolitan pest.", "design": "Here is our device and it works in three aspects.In fact, we made a big improvement about our device on the monitor unit recently.We also design a wider ring under the cover, to avoid the slide when device shaking When using the device, customers should place the Attracting Cover with wood to attract more termites.However, when we talked about our device with Prof. Mo, an expert on termite control, he told us that when termites eat wood, their secretion flows out and sticks on the wood nearby.Further more, we decided to design a digital circuit for customers so that they may discover the situation in a shorter time with less attention paid to the device.The device works like this: Pine put in the device will attract termites and when climbing into the device, they will eat the Toxin accidently and die in or out of the device.After the effective Toxin was coated by CNC, we need a convenient device to place our poison in.Once termites eat the block, the string will elongate and another wooden block will get out of the device to alert the users.In order to be easier for the users to clean it up for a second use the device is designed to be removable.With this application, it does not matter if our customers have any problem using our device.In our new version, we abort this design and change the passageway in the box into small holes.In the last version, we used a compressed spring which is connected to a thin wooden block.By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of TERMITE TERMINATOR and present Techno-moral vignettes, focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application.Once they notice the bottom holes are getting smaller, or stuck by termites\u0092 secretion, the Trap Cover should take the place of the attracting cover and the Kill Function works!One of our goals is to kill all termites in a house.We want to kill all termites but our toxin will not be influential for a very long period.Besides functions, we think more to improve our device.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "In the last two period, Toxin starts to degrade.Here (v_{Toxin}) is the velocity that Toxin is produced.In this page, we model the process of the production and degrade of Toxin to find the influence to ({Toxin-CNC-Time}), or the degradation time of Toxin in CNC-coat.({Toxin-CNC-Time}) is the degradation time of Toxin in CNC-coat while ({Toxin-air-Time}) is that in the air.Respectively, ({CNC-digest-Time}) is the time when the bait comes into another termite s gut(trophallaxis) and the CNC-coat is completely digest there.They are (t_{2}) and (t_1), respectively.$$frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} = frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]} - frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}$$$$frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} = - frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}$$Still, use function (arctan) take the place of comparing, we get the final function.Because (n_2) must be even and (frac{1}{{x^{-100}}+1}) is the integral, we choose the last one.With some typical parameter, we use NDSolve function to solve the ordinary differential equation, the answer is as below.And (K_m) is called Michaelis constant.(V_{max,2}) is the reducing velocity when Toxin is saturation, and (K_{m,2}) is another Michaelis constantThe two equation seems simple in separate formate, but it became complex when considering time factor.For the time (t_1) is much less than (t_2), the change at that time is not obvious.frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} &=&(1-step(t,t2)) frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]} - step(t,t1) frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}\\(step) function can be placed by (frac{1}{{x^{-100}}+1}) etc.To study the tendency of the reaction, the figure is at a long time (three of four times than (t_2)), and the dark green curve is a standard (exp) function curve.We will discuss is in the next section.We do not have enough time to measure the exact time when termite digest, but I suppose we have got it, as well as the time that Toxin starts to resolve.What we concern is that when our CNC-coat is degraded, the Toxin is still in the cell.During the first two period, cell produce Toxin.(V_{max}) is the producing velocity when substrate is saturated.([S]) is substrate s concentration.There are four important parameters in our design, which are ({CNC-digest-Time}), ({CNC-degradation-Time}), ({Toxin-CNC-Time}) and ({Toxin-air-Time}).Although we can premise that the Toxin will be separate by CNC-coat, and our device, as a second protection, can stop Toxin s spread, the only device s protection may not be really enough.While the next one, means even though the CNC-coat is degraded, Toxin will degrade right away so that it will not cause environment pollution.({CNC-degradation-Time}) is when CNC-coat degrades in national condition.In the ordinary differential function, we can solve the two condition respectively, but a continues function will enhance the flexibility and simplicity.Toxalbumin is produced by cell, and resolved by enzyme or itself.We built model for the process basic on Michaelis-Menten equation.", "notebook": "Discussed the application scenario for the 5000\u0080 additional sponsership of SYNENERGENE.Contacted with

eliminate all the termites in my apartment.Some of people who choose professional institute are those who know the severity of termite damage, for example, the security mentioned above.I threw the damaged furniture and fit my house again\u0085.\u0094  Although some people have experienced the damage brought by termites, the public didn\u0092t know much about the current issue about termites in Hangzhou.Fig4: Booklets presented by Hangzhou Institute of Termite Control Photo by: Zju-igemer  Fig5: ZJU-igemer consulting staff of Termite Control Institute Photo by: Zju-igemer  Although China has already earned a profound system for termite control, people who suffer from termite damage would not always choose professional institution to deal with termite invasion.Fig1: Page of termite control of a pest control company in the U.S http://www.doyourownpestcontrol.com/termite.htm  Although Chinese has a much higher population density than America, there are more wood structure buildings in America, the level of termite damage in both countries are randomly the same.But those who didn t know much about the termites would like to buy pesticide, they think they can win the termites.Citizens do not know much about Termites\u0092 living habits and their current condition, but they all have heard about the information of termites.They used the chemical insecticide and dug out the whole nest to control termite damage.People are willing to choose professional institute to control termites, but if their scale is not very large, people may choose kill termites by themselves.Chinese termite control institute has a low charging standard, because government pays them the fundamental funds and technical assistance for local institute.More than 70% of our interviewee have experienced termite damage, and they all know that termites can destroy woods with a super speed.Commercial corporations often provide citizens housing termite control services, and government agencies do better at the maintenance of public facilities.Some of interviewees would like to choose environment-friendly lifestyle, but most people will make their decision depend on the killing effect.In this summer, igemers from ZJU-CHINA visited Hangzhou Institute Of Termite Control to get more information about the current situation of termite control and consult with them about our project design.Words on banner: We Have To Win The War Against Termites  The Government Of China has set up institutes of termite control in various provinces since 1960s, in order to have better effects for fighting against termites.Termite control in the U.S consists of two main parts------commercial corporations and government agencies.However, as what is happening in China, some people would like to deal with termites by themselves, so some companies also provide customers advisors to treat termites in a suitable way.Fig5: the public promotion page of Chinese termite control institute http://www.zgbyfz.cn/byfz.asp?cid=%B0%D7%D2%CF%CE%A3%BA%A6  American institutes pay more attention to the customer experience.At the beginning, people who focused on fighting against termites were the commons who did not have enough knowledge to deal with termites.It is worth mentioning that the destruction left by termites seems to be much more serious on historic buildings.The terrible damage to water conservancy projects caused by termites is still a great threat to the water project planning in China.The door case became into powder, all the chairs could not be used, and the reproductive termites lay on the windows.When people have problems of termite damage, they usually look for a company to solve them.80% of the dam breaks in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Region are due to termites.Fig1: People held a meeting to discuss how to control termites in 1950s.All the wooden furniture had been damaged by termites.Would you choose the pesticide, which has a bad impact to the environment but works fast and has a lower price?Obviously, provinces seated in the region south of the Yangtze River suffer more from termite damage.Question 2: Almost 50% of interviewees would choose professional institute, and another 50% prefer to buy pesticide themselves.We pick 8 typical provinces, which locate from south to north: Hainan; Guangxi; Guangdong; Fujian; Anhui; Hubei; Shandong and Liaoning, and then gather the rough data for termite damage to the housing construction.Most citizens do not know the significance of \u0091environment-friendly\u0092 and do not care about the problem, and they prefer chemical termitcide.For this reason, ZJU-IGEMers tried to promote the idea of \u0091From Nature For Nature\u0092 to realize the environment-friendly synthetic biological method to termite control--------Termite Terminator.Would you like to choose biological control method, which is much safer but costs more?In the campus of Zhejiang University, in spring and summer it is easy to see the trees intruded by termites.The website pages of American termite control company show a customer-friendly attitude and leave an effective impact to people scan their websites.One female white collar pointed out that, it doesn\u0092t matter how much it costs, the most important thing is to live healthily.Chemical insecticide costs less and the low-dose poison won\u0092t be harmful to human being.People prefer to call for governmental institutes to eliminate termites  4.The integrated control of termites begins in 1950s in China.People that do not choose biological drugs have two main reasons, one is that cheap and valid chemical is enough for them to use.Fig4: trees damaged by termites in German Park photo by: Ming Chen ZJU-instructor  Every southern

"background": "", "description": "2) occurs inBased on the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP in the pathways mentioned above, GPP synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation between IPP and DMAPP to synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the burden for E. coli, so in our research, we transferred both GPPS gene and LS gene into theIn our project we decided to use E. coli, MEP pathway to express limonene.We then add 5?L 5% limonene (T) and DMSO (C) respectively at the two small circular filters in the experimental groups(Fig.This proves that many terpenes can attract plant-parasitic nematodes in naturalSome researches showed that limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\u0092s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many kinds of volatiles to induce nematodes that are harmful to these predators.We put two small pieces of circular filter paper 2.5cm from the center of the circle (Fig.Later we add 30?L suspension of the nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\u00a0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.", "design": "First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\u0092s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.The fourth area is made up of a cuboid outer shell, which can support the device.The figure above shows our product \u0096 Device 1.0.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.This change fulfills our aim to save money and energy, which is also more economical and enviromentally friendly.As shown above, device 2.0 has two shells \u0096 an outer shell and an inner shell.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.The third area is light controlling area, which includes a LED light.When it is turned on, red emission will activate the promoter and bacterial cells will express attracting substance; while the LED light is turned off, toxalbumin will be produced.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "To make the project applicable in real life, we designed a device with modified engineering bacteria inside, which can be placed in soil to attract and kill nematodes.Assuming there is a farmland, we took advantage of gas diffusion and nematodes\u0092 movement analogue simulation to find the best position for the device to be placed.We established a database to broaden the scope of our applications, combined with our methods, to kill more different pests.Additionally, it takes time for nematodes to reach the device, so we can determine the distance between the devices we place according to the three-day-period and the crawl speed of nematodes.Let L be the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment, V is nematodes\u0092 crawl speed, and T is time nematodes need to develop into adult.Firstly, we considered a square farmland, to minimize the number of equipment we use, the arrangement mode of equipment is as follows (firstly, we consider the situation with four devices arranged together).As shown above, the white circles represent the devices of colon bacillus, while the bigger circles represent diffusion, with the same odorousness in a circle.Our modeling process is given below:Nematodes can be attracted if the attraction concentration of limonene is higher than the lowest attractant concentration and then can move towards the direction of the highest odor concentration after attracted by the limonene smell[4].Engineering bacteria in our device are able to produce enough limonene as we need.Nematodes move on a 2D plane.The rules of the movement are as follows:The nematodes move towards 4 different directions: front, behind, right and left;Every time the nematode choose one of the 4 directions randomly and the probability of these 4 directions are the same;If the nematode move to the place where the gas concentration is lower than the previous position, then the nematode will move back to the previous position.We did the different simulation experiments with one device in the farmland and four devices in the farmland separately.In order to apply our hypothesis and methodology to more agricultural pests control, we established a database.And we can achieve remote control by using radio technology.With these improvements to our device, we want to figure out how we can put our technology into practice in farmland, and whether our device would be more efficient and economical than the methods used currently used in killing nematodes (crop-dusting mostly).In order to meet the lowest attractant concentration, the concentration of limonene produced by every device should be (24.8 g/cm^3).The explanations of simulation: In the video above, we built up a simulation model of the movement of nematodes using the cellular automaton in MATLAB.Based on the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment which has been acquired in the first question, we obtain:Considering that odorousness will be reduced with the increase of distance away from the device, we should only consider about the superposed odorousness at point F(considering four equipment now) to reach the lowest attractant concentration.We set the attraction time as 3 days and the distance between two devices is 100 m. As the evenly distribution of nematodes is from 5 cm to 15 cm underground, we put the device into the place which is 10 cm underground.In order to answer these two questions, especially the second one, we need to conduct a simulation of the movement of nematodes to determine the most suitable place in the farmland to place our device.In matrix A, we assume that the device is put on row i and column j (i, j).In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.It shows how nematode moves in a real farmland with the device.We hope this new environment-friendly method, based on principles of synthetic biology, could be shared with and improved by the researchers all over the world.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.Because the movement range of nematodes is within 10cm and the distance between two devices is much longer than 10cm, we can ignore the depth.When the gas diffuses in space, the concentration is not affected by temperature, aerodynamics or other factors.The device emits gas continuously and the concentration is uniform in space.And after the gas diffusion, the attractant concentration will stabilize.Considering that we need to control the density of nematodes in a proper range, we hope to do this by killing all the mature nematodes within certain period of time under the identical condition.(2i+1)(2sqrt{Dt})^{2i+1}}) end{array} end{equation}This is the schematic diagram of our device in a 300m \u00d7 300m farmland according to results of simulation.First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.Thus we obtain:Where C1 is the superposed odorousness diffused from the device, C0 is the lowest attractant concentration.According to Fick s Law, We obtain a 3-D gas diffusion model.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).Orientation of the entomogenous nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae to carbon dioxide[J].Its mathematical expression is as follows:$$frac{partial C(t,x)}{partial t} = D_{A}frac{partial ^2 C(t,x)}{partial x^2}$$C(x,t) is the concentration at the distance of X from gas source in t, N0 is the concentration of gas source, D is the diffusion coefficient.According to the model above, we obtain the gas diffusion model in 3D.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.And we found that the Meloidogyne needs 8.5d-10.5d to develop into second instar larvae from monoplast egg according to an exiting literature[9].And according to the principle of isotropy, we simplify the problem in 1D.We build a gas diffusion model to calculate the gas concentration at each point in matrices.Since the three dimensions have no difference between each other, we simplify the question into a 1-D situation according to isotropy.According to Fick s Law, points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of x Since the three dimension has no difference between each other, we simplify the question into 1-D situation according to isotropy.A brief introduction to the Fick s Law: It points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of X, the change rate of concentration to time is equal to the negative value of the change rate of diffusion flux to distance.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\u0092s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.We will update relevant information about the engineering bacteria we designed to kill the pests in our database.Currently, our database contains the biobrick we established in this project and the one established by team ZJU-CHINA.All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!Liang W, Li Q, Chen L, et al.The proportion of virtual nematode and real nematode is 0.0084.The nematodes is distributed randomly at the beginning.It\u0092s obvious that in this farmland (do not consider points on the sides of the square), point F is the farthest point away from the four equipment.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.And the procedures below were conducted in a fume hood.Step 3.What\u0092s more, squares ABCD are the simplified farmland.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.We will attract nematodes into our device in time d and kill them in time d. We found that all nematodes are killed after two \u0093slaughters\u0094.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.We hope to take a better use of this new environmental-friendly method from the context synthetic biology and share it with researchers all over the world.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.We opened the faucet of the separating funnel in order to let HCl flow into the test tube under the atmospheric pressure.In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on nematode trophic groups in a Chinese paddy-field ecosystem[J].Ye H Y, Ye B P, Wang D Y.

device 2.0 has two shells \u0096 an outer shell and an inner shell.", "notebook": "The goal of our modeling project is to give a best attractant of concentration so that we can determine the most economical plan.We prepared the L-limonene and D-limonene and the synthases expression E. coli (BL21,pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) without standardization of them both, which were cryopreserved with glycerol.We prepared the BW25113 competent cells in terms of the component efficiency kit, and we detected their efficiency of transformation by transforming rfp-PSB1C3 plasmids of different concentration into the cells.We transformed pSB1C3-rMpL into BW25113 competent cells to cultivate on the LB plate and inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the obtained monoclonal colony to produce bacteria solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We revived the limonene synthases expression E. coli strain preserved in glycerol.We assembled bace16-pSB1C3 and transformed it into E. coli DH5?.And we processed nematodes\u0092 chemotaxis replication experiment of limonene as well.We also did expression replication experiments by doing SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample) which came out an obvious band (89kd).We ensured the empty vector plasmid was correct with three groups of restriction digestion.We repeated the induction experiment with different concentration gradient of arabinose as before, while we just collected the precipitation without extracting proteins this time.We built a device all by handwork!We inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the monoclonal colony to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction, and we named the obtained plasmid pUC57-rMpL.We digested the plasmid PSB1C3-RFP sent by iGEM and the pUC57-rMpL with restriction enzyme separately and obtained the PSB1C3 backbone and rMpL gene segment which were connected together later on to assemble the plasmid PSB1C3-rMpL.Together with members majoring in physics, mathematics and biology, we drafted an abstract settlement concentrating on how to simulate the concentration of nematodes in chemotaxis.And we sent plasmids extracted this time for sequencing.We re-prepared the homogenate of the revived E. coli-BL21(pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) for SDS-PAGE and enlarge cultivated the standard bacteria (BL21-pSB1c3) transformed the second time to express the objective product.We transformed bace16-pSB1C3 into the newly obtained BW25113 competent cells to express for another time, and examined the result with SDS-PAGE.We went on the expression experiment of rMpL as above except that we added parallel controll groups whereas canceled the control ones expressed under 37C and prolonged the expression period.After the result of digestion exam was correct we extracted the plasmid and did sequencing, and we transformed the plasmid with correct sequence into E. coli BW25113 to establish expression strain.We activated the preserved culture and enlarge cultivated it in 250 mL conical flask, inducting expression with different concentration gradient of L-arabinose, we collected the precipitation after centrifuging the bacteria solution.Additionally, we learned the life history, growth properities and feeding method of nematodes.We prepared nematodes for enlarge cultivation and induced expression of the LS expression E. coli, and we synchronized a batch of nematodes for verification.We digested rfp-pSB1C3 with two isocaudamas Spe I and Xba I and prepared empty vector plasmid as negative control of whether the desired gene expressed.Since we could get the solution of best concentration of attractant and the diffusion of nematodes, we decided to go towards a further step.We transformed into E. coli DH5? the bace16-pSB1C3 to find that the result of plasmid extraction and enzyme digestion was correct, thus we confirmed the problem was from the expression strain.We re-cultivated the collected bacteria and mixed up the recombined bacteria with the control ones to a certain scale (1:4) to coat on NGM medium, preparing for nematodes cultivation of toxic test.Another important module of our project is to build a database which researchers and even farmers can get information of bio-pesticide easily.Then we recycled the backbone and gene segments following the agarose gel DNA extraction kit and linked them to produce plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3 and d-limonene-pSB1C3.We continued to watch the movement of nematodes under toxic test, where the nematodes of M9 group was generally active, partly died of bace16 and heated bace16 groups, and acted normally in pSB1C3 group.Another SDS-PAGE of extracellular proteins extract was run while the objective band was still not observed.However, we still failed to observe obvious expression of rMpL, against which we suspected there occurred something wrong with the expression bacteria and planed to change bacteria strain to express de novo.We put the database on the github.com and it can be edited and added new items by all users.We transferred plasmids with correct sequenced d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS gene into expression strain E. coli BL21 respectively to express LS and GPPS.The problem was confirmed to be from the expression strain as mentioned above, so we adopted a new strain of BW25113 and continued our experiment.We enlarge cultivated the standard LS expression bacteria (E. coli-BW2513-pSB1C3) and expressed the objective produce (in contrast with empty vector).Congratulations!We tried some simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation to be familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We designed parts rMpL and bace16 by adding pBAD promoter (BBa_K206000) and RBS(BBa_B0034) to the upstream region of rMpL gene and bace16 gene, and we committed the GENEWIZ company to synthesize the rMpL and bace16 gene segment.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.So we re-transformed the plasmids from the company into E. coli DH5?and BL21 separately and did all the cultivation, plasmid extraction, enzyme digestion de novo to make sure the examine result correct.The results of SDS-PAGE suggested that d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS were expressed successfully.Incubate the bacteria with 8 (mu)M, 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose , run SDS-PAGE after ammonium sulfate precipitation.Change the E. coli strain to express rMpL, only add 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose for incubation this time.To test if rMpL is expressed in the pallet or the supernatant, ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to enrich the protein.using Ultrasonication and SDS-PAGE are also used during this process.This week we discussed factors that would influence the putting model of equipment on the farmland.So we extracted the bace16-pSB1C3 from the expression strain BW25113 for restriction enzyme digestion and no objective band was extracted still.We inoculated the obtained monoclonal colony into 10 mL centrifuge tubes to produce bacterium solution for plasmid extraction, the enzyme digestion result of which was incorrect that a band around 500~750 bp appeared whereas the backbone band lost.We examined the extracted plasmid with enzyme digestion, no objective band observed as a result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry powder.However, we regrettably observed that the effect of expression is not ideal from the SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis of both the homogenate and the supernatant.We realized that our original assumption that we regarded nematodes as static models couldn t react to some essential properties of nematode moving.We transformed the plasmid rfp-pSB1C3(BBa_J04450) in DH5? and proceeded amplification to obtain the standard plasmid backbone.We prepared some common used reagent such as TAE, antibiotics and LB cultural medium.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.We extracted the plasmid and did restriction enzyme digestion to test and verify the plasmid backbone PSB1C3, and preserve the correct plasmid for subsequent experimental use.We designed the sequence of Limonene synthase (LS) that would be transformed to E. coli to express.Our designed sequences were based on the two cDNA sequences of LS expression sequence--Citrus unshiu CitMTSE1 for d-limonene synthase and Mentha spicata 4S-limonene synthase, together with prefix and suffix codes and restriction enzyme cutting site were sent to the company for optimum synthesis.We obtained the plasmid of gene rMpL with PUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.The results verified that compound limonene could attract nematodes preliminarily.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria of experimental group and control group.We did SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample), no significant difference observed between the bands.In addition, the differences between bands of BW25113 and BL21 were obvious when ran SDS-PAGE together whereas the objective band of BW25113 couldn t be ensured.We expressed bace16 protein twice and prolonged the expression period to overnight.At the same time, we carried out the experiment of attractive interactions of limonene towards nematodes several times.Third, we had built a basic frame of the database.Sequencing gene l-limonene and d-limonene synthesized by the company to get an unsatisfactory result, we speculated that these plasmids were extracted from the wrong BW25113.Also we improved our device and made a 3D model of it, which we called Device 2.0.To verify whether limonene had been synthesized by bacteria, the fermentation broth was tested by GC-MS in School of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University.According to pair t test, we concluded that limonene could attract nematodes.According to the original paper, rMpL is soluble protein expressed inside the cell, so target protein should be still in pallets.The correct plasmids examined with restricton enzyme digestion was preserved in -20\u00b0, named l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57.We digested the plasmid pSB1C3-RFP from iGEM as well as l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57 separately with restriction enzymes to get pSB1C3 backbone and the two gene segments, among which the brightness of pSB1C3 backbone band was quite weak.That\u0092s why we had to make it by hands.We tried another protocol of replication experiment as increasing the amount of sample whereas the effect was still not ideal indicated by the statistical result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.Considering there are so many factors can\u0092t be predicted in the real situation, we talked about how to idealize and simplify our putting model.In order to testify if engineering bacteria have the ability to express limonene, amplification cultured bacteria liquid covered with n-hexane was cultured in the shaking table to express production.Inhibition is observed on the plate inoculated with recombinat bacteria.Through a lot of discussion among our group, and with accumulating realization and knowledge of this program, we finally came up with a method to solve the problem of how to place equipment we made on the farmland.We optimized the protocol of replication experiment on and on, and the growth condition of nematodes is favorable.Finally, we chose traditional technology to produce devices in the future if it was verified that our device had high value of application.At the same time, we make the model revision.Run SDS-PAGE and get bands which might be rMpL.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria.Still, we failed to observe objective band at all the supernatant of bacteria, homogenate and supernatant of ultrasonic broken cells.We induced expression of rMpL continuously with arabinose in concentration gradient to acquire a stable expression condition.Meanwhile, it appeared to be some problems of other groups\u0092 digestion too, against which we speculated that the cause may be the pollution of reagent, star activity or something wrong with the expression strain.GENEWIZ gave us the relevant feedback in time and modified the two sequences to synthesize again.We did the simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation again to be further familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We started to work on it.We transformed the obtained plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3?d-limonene-pSB1C3 into E. coli BW25113 and cultivated 10mL centrifuge tube with them to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We found the gene sequence of bace16(AAV3D0845) and the cDNA sequence of MpL(GeneBank accession number HQ449739) from the Genebank, and optimized the coded sequences in E. coli.After we determined the theme of our project, we recuited more undergraduates from related colleges, including college of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.Second, the device we had made actually was not applicable enough, which required further improvement.No positive results are observed in 4 days.Cultivate recombinant bacteria, bacteria with empty vector or OP50 bacteria for nematoxicity test of rMpL protein.As we discussed the influencing factors last week, our main work this week was to search documents to see what exact influence these factors would bring to our result, and whether these factors can be ignored or idealized.After being amplification cultured and expressing aiming products, the bacteria were smashed by ultrasonication.However, the cost of product by 3D print is too high.We also transferred empty pSB1C3 plasmids into expression strain E. coli BL21 and regarded them as the control group.Finally our plan is to design and build a debug device.We cultivated nematodes and proceeded synchronization, and we did replication experiment of baiting nematodes with linalool using pure chemical compound (linalool).", "protocol": "Incubate upside down at 37\u00b0C overnight.Flush nematodes from the plate with M9, centrifugate (1500 r.p.m, 3min), abandon the supernatant and resuspend the precipitation with 3mL M9.Add 500(mu)L resuspended solution to the NGM plate inoculated with mixed E.coli as mentioned above as experimental group and NGM plate with blank E.coli as control group.Make 3 repeats of each concentration.Flush nematode from the plate with M9 and inoculate 20 (mu)L (about 30 nematodes) into the center of the medium.Inoculate 5mL LB liquid mediums added Chl with experimental group E.coli BW25113 (transformed with rMpl or bace16 genes) and blank control group separately.37\u00b0C incubate overnight.Observe and compare the activation and size of nematodes of each group and draw a conclusion.Autoclave the above mentioned reagents with 120\u00b0C for 30 min and then water bath them to 65\u00b0C.Add 1ml cholesterol, CaCl2, MgSO4 and 25 mL phosphoric acid buffer into the minimum medium in order (all at 65\u00b0C, shake up).Streak inoculate OP50 on LB solid

set a series of concentration gradient of attractant.Divide the NGM solid medium (d = 6 cm) equally into two parts (drawing on the surface of the culture dishes).Put 50 (mu)L compound of different concentration and DMSO as contrast respectively on the two parts.Cut down a square of NGM(about 1cm x 1cm) with nematodes.Put the square on the NGM medium with OP50 and let the surface with nematodes adown to contact the medium.Watch the growth condition of nematodes under the stereoscope everyday and re-inoculate every 4 to 5 days to avoid the nematodes growing too densely.For inoculating abundant nematodes rapidly, or changing plate to provide more food and better condition for them, we can flush them with M9 and centrifuge them with 1500 r.m.p for 1 min, and incubate the precipitate on a new plate.Grow slowly at 16\u00b0C and grow fast at 25\u00b0C while egg laying amount declines.Inoculate NGM medium with 150~200 (mu)L OP50, incubate at 37\u00b0C for 12hr.", "result": "2) occurs inBased on the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP in the pathways mentioned above, GPP synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation between IPP and DMAPP to synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the burden for E. coli, so in our research, we transferred both GPPS gene and LS gene into theIn our project we decided to use E. coli, MEP pathway to express limonene.We then add 5?L 5% limonene (T) and DMSO (C) respectively at the two small circular filters in the experimental groups(Fig.This proves that many terpenes can attract plant-parasitic nematodes in naturalSome researches showed that limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\u0092s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many kinds of volatiles to induce nematodes that are harmful to these predators.We put two small pieces of circular filter paper 2.5cm from the center of the circle (Fig.Later we add 30?L suspension of the nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\u00a0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.", "safety": "In addition, we established a photoinduced bidirectional transcription system regulated by light, where we can divide the process of attracting and killing nematodes into two periods to realize the relatively timing and quantitative release of the toxic proteins, bringing down the retention in the environment.Thirdly, a suicide system was constructed based on the principles of quorum sensing in microorganisms which would enable us to control the bacterial colony density artificially and therefore the quantity of engineering bacteria can be maintained in a stable and controllable range.Considering the biosafety, we improved device 2.0 into a relatively closed unit, and we also designed a dome to cover the medium.(Fig.1)We replaced GFP and RFP with limonene synthase and toxic protein respectively, so the release of the two proteins can be regulated by gp35 directly, and by light signals indirectly.Generally speaking, the Switch system works in this way--provide the system with light of wavelength in 600nm at first so gene gp35 will be repressed and the system will express the chemical attractants like limonene.In conclusion, the significance of our system is that we have built a photoinduced bidirectional system to avoid a simultaneous and strong expression of the bait and toxic proteins, in which way we can avoid the potential harm done to environment by the system.We not only considered the potential safety problem caused by the high expression of the toxic protein and attractant, but also designed a suicide system for our engineering bacterias to solve the problem by regulating the population size of our bacterias.We built our system based on the phenomenon of quorum sensing[1].In addition, replacement as well as remove of medium and engineering bacteria would all be done in the labs or safety rooms of factories which guarantee relative closure of the device used in farmland and avoid engineering bacteria spreading.Although Bace16 and rMpL are both toxic proteins towards nematodes specially, the over expression of these proteins can also break the ecological equilibrium inevitably.While when the concentration of attractants reaches a certain point (see modeling part), we would turn off the light to trigger the expressing of protein gp35 to push the system work in a reverse direction so that the toxic protein would be expressed.In addition, after the engineering bacteria works, the device would be recycled and the residual bacteria would be disinfected.3.Is it safer, cheaper, or better than other technologies that do the same thing?We concluded the action objects and disadvantages of various traditional nematicides of China according to related literatures, and the result is shown below.High toxicity Do harm to the soil, the environment even the health.This complex can bind with promoter luxpR, after which the transcription of mazf gene in the downstream will be triggered and bacterias will be killed by toxin protein MazF[2].Firstly, we designed a device to cultivate E.coli inside and restricted their movement at the same time, thus preventing the difussion of our engineering bacteria to soil.Will it be sterilized, discarded, or recycled?Our device is designed to be recyclable so the growing state can be checked at regular intervals, which means once something wrong happens, we can adjust the bacterial colony timely.With the biosynthesis of PCB, Cph8 can serve as a photoreceptor that regulates gene expression through PompC.In order to regulate the direction of promoter J23110 under the light signal, an integrase, gp35, is added to the upstream region of the PompC promoter.We constructed two main circuits.When gp35 expresses, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.Cph1 is a member of the plant photoreceptor family.As for environmental safety, on one hand, we design a semi-closed device to avoid the spread of engineering bacterias in which way we could increase the safety level and improve the attracting and killing efficiency of our bacteria; On the other hand, light-regulated bidirectional transcription system can avoid over-expression of toxin proteins, and the design of suicide part can regulate the population density of engineering bacteria.This system can be divided into three main parts: photoinduced system, bidirectional transcriptional system and bait-killer system.The red light sensor (Cph8) is a fusion protein which consists of a phytochrome Cph1 and a histidine kinase domain, Envz-OmpR.The first one expresses gp35 serine integrase,(Fig.1) which can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP, the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome.All in all, biosafety is ensured in both the developing and the application stage of our project.1.At first, the plasmid expresses GFP.It is probably do harm to the crops.It is suitable for the burst of the nematodes disasters.Next it is beneficial to the creatures who live in the environment suffering serious nematodes disasters because the traditional nematicides do harm to human.For instance, all team members in the lab should wear clothes for lab-use, wear gloves and work in the super clean bench when necessary; poison reagent should be used in the fuming cupboard; and the waste liquid and medium should be poured or thrown differently.", "keywords": "Xochimilco formaldehyde Sclerotite temperature components hydrolysis saccharification post-staining resistance expression", "track":

the degradation of insecticide pyrethroids is 3-phenoxybenzoate (3-PBA).Because of the wide use of pyrethroids and the stability of the diarylether compound itself, 3-PBA is typically detected as an important environmental contaminant.The main metabolite in the degradation of insecticide pyrethroids is 3-phenoxybenzoate (3-PBA) which is is typically detected as an important environmental contaminant[1].Through searching a large number of papers and analyzing data, we found that the harms of 3-PBA are as follows:The half life period of 3-PBA is about 180 days , longer than most of pyrethroids, making it difficult to be degraded in the environment.Hindering the mineralization of pyrethroids?which cut off the biodegradation pathway that pesticide is transformed into non-toxic (poisonousless) small molecule.3-PBA is an important material in chemical industryTo analyze the toxicity of the 3-PBA, we used fruit fly to test.Our device is designed to degrade 3-phenoxybenzoatecompletelyFig2.The passway of biodegradation of 3-pba in our engineering bacteriaCopA, the principal copper effluxATPase in Escherichia coli, is induced by elevated copper in the medium[1].Gene cluster pbaA1A2B and gene pbaC encode the 3-phenoxybenzoate 1 ,2 -dioxygenase,which is an angular dioxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation in the 1 and 2  positions of the benzene moiety of 3-phenoxybenzoate(3-PBA)[4], yielding 3-hydroxybenzoate(3-HBA)[5] and catechol.D .Changes in fluorescenceintensity in E.coli which do not contain copA promoter comparing with two strains.We placed insulator RiboJ between copA promoter and RBS(Fig.5).Fig.5.Two device used to detect copper in solution, the upper device has riboJ and the under one has no riboJ.Catechol , an intermediate metabolite of 3-PBA, is toxic to the Escherichia coli.Output ( fluorescence) depended only on the activity of copA promoter when be induced, and not the sequence at the part junction.In the lab, we aim to realize the biodegradation of 3-PBA using recombinant plasmid.By measuring fluorescence intensity in cells by flow cytometer,we got data to analyze sensitivity and specificity of copA promoter.In our experiment, copA promoter was induced by different concentration of copper ion (37.5umol/L, 50umol/L, 62.5umol/L, 75umol/L) .We tested 3-PBA s influence on reproductive capacity of fruit fly, and found that 3-PBA can affect the normal secreting of sex hormone.We counted the number of the new imagoes hatched by flies that were fed in medium with 3-PBA before.In comparison of two graphs A, B, we can obviously find that the degradation of protein is much faster in DH5? than that in BL21 (DE3)?because BL21 (DE3) has a deficiency of protease.CopA promoter is active in the presence of copper ion.We intended to character copA promoter independently.Actually, the fluorescence which produced by the leakage of copA will not change.The change quantity comes from the different growth periods of the E.coli.In the group of 0?mol/L Cu2+, the fluorescence shows a trend of falling firstly then rising(Fig.3C).So bacteria will go through a period of growing from growth period to maturation period, so as to the change of the fluorescence.Maturation period is great period for the expression of protein.The genes pbaC-pbaA1A2B-c23o-mhbDHIM, encoding enzymes of the 3-phenoxybenzoate degradation pathway were successfully built finally.and the whole metabolic pathway is shown in Fig2..Fig1.Based on these facts we can get a formula Net proceeds(N)=Benefit(B)-Cost(C).Simplest genetic circuit ---our small step to degradationWe used constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) to transcribe downstream genes including gene cluster pbaA1A2B and C23O.Insecticide pyrethroids are widely used in the agricultural production to control the insect pest.However, the efficiency of removal of these compounds by bacteria is actually low for they evolve on the basis of environmental fitness rather than degradation efficiency.Therefore , we utilized RiboJ which was placed between promoter and protein coding sequence to eliminate the interference of two different parts.However, according to our preliminary experiment , Sphingobiumwenxiniae JZ-1T is easy to lose the ability of degradation and cannot grow in LB medium containing high concentration of 3-PBA.Fig.3.A.Changes in fluorescenceintensity induced by different concentration of copper ion in E.coli BL21 (DE3).RiboJ can reliably maintain relative promoter strengths.We test copA promoter in BL21 (DE3),DH5?.CopA promoter has relative leaky basal expression by comparing the negative control\u0092s output and basal leakage of copA promoter in E. coli expression systems(Fig.4).As a metabolite, 3-PBA is easy to be ignored by people.", "design": "Sphingobium wenxiniae JZ-1 was designed to put into the unit to degrade pyrethroids.Meeting the standard of farmland discharge in China main landAccording to the urban sewage treatment method , sedimentation , sludge treatment , disinfecton[5] can cut down the index value to meet the standard.Fig.The screen shoot cut for the 3D vision of the physcial unit*The whole unit is divided into five rooms and they are numbered separately (the second room is under the first room; number 5 is not marked and the fifth room is near the fourth room from right to left orientation ) and all the plates used to separate the unit into five rooms are covered by the 0.22?m bacterial membrane to prevent the bacterial escape.On the bottom of the first room there is acticarbon to pretreat the water to be purified.Both 3-PBA and pyrethroids can be found in the run off water.For being eager to take the first steps to make our project real, we designed a physcial unit applied in the field to purify farmland runoff water (regarded as the main factor of agricultral pollution[1]) including 3-PBA and pyrethroids.Through farmland investigation, we found runoff water from cropland was seldom collected and purified.3) The ponds can collect the contaminant [4].To put the engineered bacteria into practice, some issues have to be handled.Meeting the standard of farmland discharge in China main land3-PBA comes from its parent compounds pyrethroids which are more frequently touched by the public and also is used as a generic biomarker for multiple pyrethroids exposure for pyrethroid residues in the environment.Set a man-made pond(?) to collect pyrethroids and 3-PBA and the physical unit(?) is beside the pond.The unit is pumped.The physical unit will be put into the places applied pyrethroids to achieve its value.2) people in the research institutes always want to use plant ryegrass and photinia fraseri to lighten contamination[3].Based on documents, we found 1) people had no idea about farmland runoff water disposal [2].Between the pond and the place applied pyrethroids(?) there is a moderate climb(?) to help the pyrethroids and 3-PBA collecting.Avoiding to pollute the drinking water source the man-made pond should be at least away from the water source 90 meters.The third room is used to cut down the BOD and COD index value applying yeast and Actinobacillus.Based on our questionnaire, about 10% of interviewees come from rural areas, but only 3.5% of the whole interviewees know that pyrethroids are widely used pesticides

Pesticide interactions; Effects of organ phosphorus pesticides on the metabolism, toxicity, and persistence of selected pyrethroid insecticides[J].Under natural conditions, pyrethroid pesticides are hard to degrade, while their long-term accumulation leads to accumulated toxicity, contributing to chronic diseases[4], neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity[5].Pyrethroid pesticides are also used as domestic insect repellents.Among them, the active ingredient of insect repellent fragrance is \"diethyltoluamide\", while that of the other products is pyrethroids.Our NAU iGEM team member investigated in supermarket the components of certain insect repellent products as indicated by the user survey.This preliminary research provides good ideas to our questionnaire design.According to literature review, we know that pyrethroid insecticides are widely and heavily used in our life due to their large application scope.By way of literature review, we know that pyrethroids are important ingredients of mosquito coil, electric mosquito mat, electric mosquito liquid, etc., expect for insect repellent fragrance.The analysis results are as follows:The survey shows that most insect repellent users choose insect repellent fragrance, mosquito coil and electric mosquito liquid.Some exposure to pyrethroid pesticides may not have effects on ordinary adults, but to fetuses and infant, the same exposure may cause severe developmental disorders.The correct way to buy and use pyrethroid pesticide properly, the way to reduce pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits and measures to take after pyrethroid pesticide poisoning, etc.Chronicillness as a result of low-level exposure to synthetic pyrethroid insecticides: a review of the debate.27.50% of the respondents use up more than 1 bottle (box) of insect repellent product throughout a summer.All these data show that humans have frequent and long-term exposure to pyrethroid insecticides.[3] WOLANSKY M J, HARRILL J A. Neurobehavioral toxicology of pyrethroid insecticides in adult animals: A critical review[J].[1-3] .Recent studies have shown that pyrethroid pesticides are not low-toxic and safe as expected.They are proved effective both in crop pest control of vegetables and fruit trees and as domestic insecticides in killing mosquitoes, cockroaches, head lice, etc.", "modeling": "How to reduce the pressure of the environment?We have the idea that the expression of non-essential protein and the metabolic structure will influence metabolic rate and genetic stability.To varify the idea, In our model we focused on quantitative analysis of the pathway involved in the degradation metabolism of 3-pba in E.coli.This type of analysis of cellular metabolism can be used to gain a better understanding of the adding pathway\u0092s influence in E.coli and identify key targets for genetic manipulation that could enhance the degradation pathway.Left is the main metabolic network in E.coli while right is the engineering E.coli in our project.By benefits and cost analysis,we can know the metabolic burden of producing these extra proteins while by MCA we can learn the control structure of the metabolic network so as to do an efficient adjustment.So in our work we didn\u0092t take care of the concentration of PYR.In our work,we will discuss the modeling in three aspects?dynamic model,benefits and cost analysis and metabolic control analysis(MCA).The development of a dynamic model can help us learn the dynamic change within the cell and the control structure.Assumption: regulate the expression of non-essential protein and the metabolic structure will gain a fast metabolic rate and better genetic stability.Fischer, E. and U.

uranium adsorption and recovery - we needed a protein polymer network which contains several functional modules.To address these drawbacks, the Peking iGEM team put forward the Uranyl Reaper project, which aimed to develop an innovative method to deal with uranium pollution.In order to achieve this goal, we designed an extraordinary biological adsorption polymer network which was produced by engineered bacteria and self-assembled completely autonomously.How to collect the protein polymer network together with the adsorbed uranyl from the environment?Impressively, in a trial where the concentration of uranyl was set at 10?M, the polymer network with the SUP module was able to sequester nearly 90% of total uranyl ions within just one minute.The fusion proteins could be brought to their working concentration by concentrating them directly in the culture supernatants, and the resulting crude concentrates could be used directly for the ultimate goal - the Uranium Reaper.Inspired by the autocatalytic formation of the isopeptide bond between a Lys and an Asp residue in the CnaB2 protein from S. pyogenes, researchers engineered a pair of complementary truncations of CnaB2, called SpyTag and SpyCatcher1.the results indicated that the crosslinking reaction between the Triple SpyCatcher and fusion proteins could be completed in 1 hour.Considering that uranium mainly exists as uranyl ion and its carbonate in aqueous solution, we applied the Super Uranyl Binding Protein (SUP), which was designed specifically to bind uranyl via structural calculation and functional modification.Finally, signal sequences derived from OmpA, LTIIb and PhoA were found to be efficient mediators for the secretion of our recombinant proteins.Whether in E. coli or B. subtilis, secretory proteins usually contain signal peptides that are essential for their export from the cytoplasm.Which signal peptide would best promote the secretion of our constructs was inscrutable, so a library was built in order to screen for the most suitable candidates.In view of existing as well as potential future uranium pollution, the current complicated, time-consuming, inefficient and expensive treatment methods seem woefully out-of-date.[1]Zakeri, B., et al., Peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein, through engineering a bacterial adhesin.A schematic graph of the whole project is shown in Fig.", "human_practice": "The Brochure designed for public education about the project, synthetic biology and iGEM.Additionally, we popularized iGEM among middle school students from the 2016 Peking University Alumni Children\u0092s Summer Camp (Fig.After learning about the public opinion on uranium, uranium pollution, and synthetic biology, we decided to design a popular science brochure (Fig.Uranyl concentrations in water from Weiming Lake and in coal-washing wastewater  In order to assess whether there are potential dangers in our immediate vicinity, we extracted freshwater samples from Weiming Lake on campus and coal-washing wastewater from Shan Xi province, and measured the uranyl concentrations of the water samples by ICP-MS.It could thus be demonstrated that we had no need to worry too much about the effects of uranium pollution in daily life because the amount of uranium around us was within the normal range even in an otherwise quite polluted environment, such as around coal-mining operations.Additionally, we also measured the intensity of radiation in the nuclear environmental chemistry laboratory where we did the experiments with uranyl-containing solutions.), with the aim of helping them to develop a passion for biology, life sciences and synthetic biology.During this summer camp, there was a team coming to visit our lab and they were quite interested in the routine work of the iGEM team (Fig.In addition to the questionnaire survey and interviews of front-end units and experts, we have done more work related to social practice.Interestingly, the radiation intensity value in the work area was close to that determined in the playground, which could be regarded as the background value.Both were well within the drinking-water standard of the EPA which states that the amount of uranium shall not exceed 30 ?g/L, or about 126 nM1.", "modeling": "They made it a way to choose the monomers suitable for crosslinking reaction.The Peking iGEM Team has studied and expanded Paul J.

(Learn more) Demonstrated effective adsorption of uranyl ions by monomeric Triple SpyTag-SUP or polymer network containing the SUP module under a number of conditions.(Learn more) We visited experts from the College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and School of Physics of Peking University, respectively, to learn about the current situation surrounding uranium pollution in the real world and how people could control the situation.This way we could compare the methods they were using with the Uranium Reaper strategy.In the protein polymeric network, the concentration of enzymes could be increased and the efficiency of biocatalysis may consequently also be enhanced.If we optimize the number of SpyTag or SpyCatcher modules per protein monomer, as well as the working concentrations of proteins, we may make protein-3D printing using the Spy Crosslinking Network come true.Links to detailed lab results could also be found on these pages.We submitted 53 high-quality and

special software which could be used to calculate the molecular weight distribution of protein polymers using Flory\u0092s theory.", "safety": "We did not make any contact with genuine, and thus potentially dangerous, pollution samples from the field.Because the bacteria used to produce and secrete the proteins were sequestered in enclosed environments, such as fermenters, and we plan on only using the proteins instead of live bacteria to deal with pollution in the environment, we did not add a kill-switch in this project.What we did ourselves was only to use the simulated pollution scenes for the proof-of-principle test in the Bio-safety Level 2 iGEM lab, which means that we never made any contact with genuine, potentially dangerous pollution samples from the field.As mentioned above, the DNA parts are absolutely safe because they encode non-hazardous proteins such as SpyCatcher, SpyTag, SUP, mSA and their combinations.Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experimentThe original intention of the project was to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized material to deal with uranium pollution in the environment.The bench work followed some basic regulations as below:Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission was strictly prohibited.All involved participants needed to understand the experiment completely before commencing work.Any steps involving potential release of live microorganisms were performed in a bio-safety cabinet.Appliances such as Bunsen burners, electric heaters and microwave ovens were not left unattended while in use.All liquid and solid waste potentially containing living organism was sterilized.The entire lab was sterilized using UV-light every week.The last person to leave the lab always made sure that water, electricity, gas, and the air conditioner were shut down, and doors and windows have been locked before leaving.For the proof-of principle test, all uranyl solutions were prepared by specially trained professional researchers in the Nuclear Environmental Chemistry Group of Peking University.Additionally, the bacterial hosts are laboratory strains which are likely to be highly uncompetitive compared wild bacteria in the outside environment.During the utilization of the bio-functional polymer network, uranyl ions are enriched to a high concentration, which is a potential cause for concern.This year\u0092s Peking iGEM Team is trying to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized biomaterial to deal with uranium pollution in the environment, using the methods of synthetic biology.In order to prove the usefulness of the concept, we did a series of experiments using simulated pollution scenes which were constructed by dissolving uranyl nitrate hexahydrate either in TBS buffer or in environmental water samples from the Weiming Lake on campus and the Bohai Sea.The strains are restricted to the lab so that the cells produce the Uranium Reaper system are continuously under rigorous control without any possibility to contact the outside environment.All media that had come in contact with bacteria were sterilized to prevent any escape of microbes.According to the requirements of iGEM policy we never performed any dangerous experiments in daily bench work or faced any unusual safety issues.The characteristics of these parts had been described in detail in previous work, and all part collections, such as the signal peptide library were derived from parts that are nonpathogenic and harmless to humans or the environment.Almost all the parts in the project were modified from pre-existing iGEM parts, such as SUP, LBP and so on.It is thus conclusive that none of the parts would raise any safety issues according to current professional knowledge.", "keywords": "TAT-Apoptin antibiotics mechanical encryption calcitonin LC-Cutinase fusicoccin tetracycline controlled polystyrene", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite":

(perfluorooctanoic acid).Due to strong binding energy of carbon-fluorine bond, these compounds are very difficult to be degraded in nature and they also accumulate in organism, causing harm to the environment and human.Since there\u0092s no regulation for banning PFCs usage and emission in most countries all over the world nowadays, environmental organizations, government and scientists have discovered liquid and volatile PFCs distribution in waters, in snow, in the air, and even in drinking water.Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), including PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooactanesulfonic acid), are hazardous man-made chemicals produced or used in industry and daily necessities.[3] PFOA, one of the most studied PFCs, has been detected in adults  bodies around the world.Mutation Research / Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis Genotoxic potential of the perfluorinated chemicals PFOA , PFOS , PFBS , PFNA and PFHxA in human HepG2 cells.Therefore, we hope to develop an efficient and eco-friendly method to keep the world from PFCs disaster.Our goal is to break carbon-fluorine bonds in PFOA.[7] Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident

concentration of PFCs in the liver.[2] In USA, Environmental Working Group (EWG) even showed statistics of PFCs pollution levels in every state.Hence, we assumed that fac-dex is the key to degrading PFOA.In the process breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released.Besides, tons of researches show that PFCs potentially cause diseases to animals and human.High concentration of PFCs have been detected in Pearl River and Yangtze River in China and some lakes in USA since 2007.We also insert a fluoride transporter gene, CRCB[9], to help our modified E.coli survive.There are two goals in our experiment: Degradation of PFOA and transportation of fluoride.What\u0092s worse, researches have suggested that PFOA is link to several disease.Groups of Scientists conducted researches on animals and found that animals which were fed with PFOA, end up with their thymus, spleens, and livers enlarged, possibly tumorous.FA1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens are able to degrade PFOA producing fluoride.[4] Because of its hydrophobicity, PFOA can stay in human body for a long time.", "design": "Meanwhile, escaping engineered bacteria will be killed for biosafety.As for PFOA bioremediation basin, we referred to the structure of current secondary treatment basin and set up a prototyping model.The best way to stop PFOA pollution caused by industrial wastewater is to remove PFOA in the wastewater before it is released into the environment.For the purpose of preventing PFOA from leaking to the enironment, we developed a bioreactor system.We designed a bioreactor and named it \u0093 PFOA bioremediation basin.\u0094 Following is a sketch of our reactor.To develop a more complete bioreactor system, we plan to integrate our own device, PFOA bioremediation basin, into the current industrial wastewater treatment process in the factory producing PFOA wastewater.First, wastewater passes through RO membrane, so that PFOA in the wastewater becomes more concentrated.Once the concentration of PFOA gets higher, the efficiency of our system can be lifted.Next, after some adjustments, such as PH value and temperature, to make the wastewater a proper environment for bacteria to grow, wastewater enters our device, PFOA bioremediation basin.After being processed in PFOA bioremediation basin, wastewater is added with calcium chloride solution of high concentration, so that fluoride, which is the predicted byproduct of PFOA degradation, can be precipitated.In addition, wastewater is set to stay in the basin for a period of time to undergo PFOA degradation performed by engineered bacteria.We apply computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to predict real situation of our project.", "human_practice": "Thanks to their help, we finally finished our provision before

completely inhibited.First, we cultured the BL21 overnight, and then added IPTG to induce Crcb, Bpe, Fluc expression.Second, we added different concentration of sodium fluoride (NaF) and used ELISA to detect the value of OD 600.We think that if Fluoride transporter work, the bacteria will grow better.Result: Compared with no plasmid control, we found a significant-different with 0.08M and 0.1M [NaF].Based on fluoride-concentration-time graph from sample of modified E.coli (BL21 with Fac-dex) and PFOA of 500 ppm initially, we can tell that the concentration of fluoride increases in time due to the performance of PFOA degradation.With the technic of SDS-PAGE, we can test if our plasmid can be expressed properly in E.coli or not.We separately induced 8 different E.coli culture that had be transformed the Fac-dex gene.From the growth curves, we found that PFOA has little influence on the growth of E.coli.In our experiment, after we transformed our plasmid into E.coli, we induced the expression of Fac-dex gene.After Fac-dex breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released, leading to the increase of fluoride concentration in waterTherefore, by detecting the fluoride concentration with Fluorine Ion Selective Electrode in time, we can know the extent of PFOA degradation by Fac-dex.Then the induced E.coli was transferred into new tube containing LB with different concentration of PFOA (As below).We use same E.coli which hadn\u0092t been induced as the negative control in lane 1.In conclusion, there are extra protein being expressed in the E.coli culture of lane 4, 5, 6, 7.If the gene is able to be induced, there should be a large quantity of Fac-dex existed in E.coli.We used the induced E.coli culture as our samples.BL21 with Fluoride transporter, grew better than control.Conclusion: First, the four figures show that if the environmental fluoride concentration increases, the bacteria which express fluoride transporter can growth better.It manifests that Fac-dex can successfully degrade PFOA and release fluoride.We inoculate starter culture at a 1:100 dilution into LB containing NaF with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.The result is as below?From the growth curve, we know that under 20mM of sodium fluoride, E.coli is able to grow normally.We cultured E.coli in liquid medium (3 ml LB and 5 ml E.coli broth) containing PFOA with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.Under 60mM of sodium fluoride, the growth curve shifted slightly.Our maybe because the amount of our engineered bacteria added in wastewater isn t many enough to work in such amount of wastewater.We also added Mg+2 as the cofactor of Fac-dex.From the result above, the F- released by PFOA degradation is not detectable for PFOA concentration below 100(ppm), 0~12 hours.We induced E.coli culture that had be transformed the Fac-dex gene.So we can t test the fluoride concentrate solely and efficiently.So, we will use

of countless human beings by controlling the population of both agricultural and urban pests, since the second half of last century, the numbers of insecticide resistant pests have been rising at an alarming rate [1].Though they might have succeeded in increasing the potency or hardiness of a fungus specie, they did not take a step further to consider that the evaluation the fungal insecticide must follow before commercialization, which includes the assessment of its toxicity towards humans and animals, dispersal, horizontal gene transfer rate, and its effects on the resident microflora [5].In reality, the amount of insecticides applied is actually proportional to the increase in resistance in the target pest population [2], [3].Some would argue that as researchers and chemical pesticide companies develop new insecticides, the resistance couldn\u0092t possibly catch up.Currently, the biopesticides that are the most widespread, in terms of usage, are the entomopathogenic-fungi insecticides[4].Using an entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, that is applied as an insecticide around the world as our chassis, we have constructed a genetically modified M. anisopliae with wildtype lethality and the additional ability to self-terminate after killing its host.1.nutrition and immune response) conditions [5].Many researchers have tried to improve these fungal insecticides through biochemical or genetic means [6], [7].This means if no action is taken to change the status quo, the ongoing population control of insect pest will become even more of a struggle.Biopesticides, including insecticidal plant extract, bacteria, and fungi, are some of the more popular alternatives to chemical pesticides.Reid, M. C., & McKenzie, F. E. (2016).St Leger, R., Joshi, L., Bidochka, M. J., & Roberts, D. W. (1996).Zhu, F., Lavine, L., O\u0092Neal, S., Lavine, M., Foss, C., & Walsh, D.

6349\u00966354.7.To address this problem, we, 2016 NYMU_Taipei, have designed a light-induced kill switch aimed to reduce the dispersal and horizontal gene transfer of genetically engineered fungal insecticides.Insecticide Resistance and Management Strategies in Urban Ecosystems.Insects, 7(1), 2.3.Certain species of entomopathogenic fungi are capable of targeting a small range of hosts, making them the ideal solution to many regional insect pests.Wang CS, St Leger RJ (2007) A scorpion neurotoxin increases the potency of a fungal insecticide.However, these biological control agents come with highly variable outcomes due to the variation in environmental (e.g.", "description": "This year we characterized and developed the part BBa_K1184000, phototoxic protein KillerRed, and a fungal selection marker gene bar BBa_K1021003.We characterized this part with thermal stability assay.KillerRed protein was extracted from transformed E.coli and a control group of empty vector was set to eliminate the influence of other proteins.This test aims to show the temperature influence on KillerRed protein by measuring its fluorescence after being treated for 2 hours at the following temperatures: 70, 70.5, 71.7, 73.5, 75.5, 78.3, 81, 83.6, 86, 88, 89.5, 92.2 (degree Celsius).", "design": "Utilizing PMcl1 from M. anisopliae, a promoter with fast activation and high production rate, high amounts of KillerRed protein with SV40 NLS will be produced and transported to the nucleus.Utilizing the promoter of PMcl1 in genetically engineering Metarhizium allows the expression of target genes to be limited to the hemocoel of the fungus  host insects, ensuring the specificity of gene expression[2].The KillerRed protein is a red fluorescent protein with excitation and emission maxima at 585 and 610 nm respectively.Through the utilization of different gene expression and location of M. anisopliae cells during different stages of its infection cycle alongside with light-induced phototoxic fluorescent proteins, we aim to design entomopathogenic-fungi-specific killswitch that can greatly mitigate the safety concerns of the genetic modified fungal insecticides in hope that it will increase the feasibility of wide spread use of these enhanced bioinsecticides.Here we show a short overview: The infection process of M. anisopliae is similar to other entomopathogenic fungi, i.e.This sets the mass production of KillerRed proteins to the hemolymph infection phase of M. anisopliae\u0092s infection cycle.Gisbert Zimmermann (2007): Review on safety of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae , Biocontrol Science and Technology, 17:9, 879-920.During M. anisopliae\u0092s stay within the hemocoel and other interior organs of the insect, KillerRed molecules will remain inert due to the lack of yellow light.The killswitch circuit contains the hemolymph-induced promoter, PMcl, followed by the KillerRed gene and a fungal terminator, TtrpC.This put fungal cells in direct contact with sunlight, allowing KillerRed to create reactive oxygen species like O2?-, which will disrupt the metabolic functions of the cells and eventually killing the fungi.This promoter controls the production of Metarhizium-collagen-like-proteins in wildtype Metarhizium anisopliae, the transcripts of the Mcl1 gene could be detected within 20 minutes of the fungus contacting the hemolymph, but could not be detected when the fungus is cultured in any other medium.However, chromatin is also a ROS-sensitive intracellular localization.So we designed to fuse a SV40 nuclear localization signal to KillerRed protein in order to increase efficiency of KillerRed-mediated oxidative stress.We designed our circuit to utilize the gene expression change of M. anisopliae to activate the production phase of our killswitch.When M. anisopliae depletes the nutrients in host s body, the fungus will emerge from the carcass of its host for conidiation.The increase concentrations of ROS in the cytoplasm disrupt normal cellular functions and impede fungal growth and, in the best case scenario, induce programed necrosis[5].KillerRed effectively killed bacterial cells when exposed to white light for several minutes.Structural Basis for Phototoxicity of the Genetically Encoded Photosensitizer KillerRed.In conclusion, our In-Out-Suicide system allows for more lethal genetically modified fungal pesticides to be developed because it provides them with a ability to clean up after itself, lowering their threat to the surrounding environment.the infection pathway consists on the following steps: (1) attachment of the spore to the cuticle, (2) germination and formation of appressoria, (3) penetration through the cuticle, (4) overcoming of the host response and immune defence reactions of the host, (5) spreading within the host by formation of hyphal bodies or blastospores, i.e.The following two ways have been found to be effective for killing the eukaryotic cells using KillerRed: (1) via an apoptotic pathway using KillerRed to target mitochondria, and (2) via membrane lipid oxidation using membrane-localized KillerRed.Proceedings

flavoprotein, then to a closely coupled Fe4S4 siroheme center in the hemoprotein, and finally from siroheme to sulphiteThe SiR-FP and SiR-HP components of SiR are encoded by cysJ and cysl, respectively.Thus, if an efficient and cost effective design of this NRFA driven pollution crusader device is realized, it would bring about a remarkable change in the automobile and diesel engine industry, and increase the efficiency of these devices, while reducing both the cost, and carbon footprints on the environment.We were able to materialize our dream of designing the perfect \"Pollution Crusader\" prototype model, using the genetically engineered Eco.coli bacteria, to a very good extent, if not fully.From the viewpoint of Synthetic Biology, we succeeded in obtaining the desired clones.The reduction of nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen requires two protons and two electrons, according to the equationN2O + 2H+ + 2e? ? N2 + H2O, E\u00b0? (pH 7.0) = 1.35 V; ?G0? = ?339.5 kJ/mol This is a challenging reaction to be catalyzed by a metalloenzyme, as nitrous oxide is not just kinetically inert to decomposition but also a poor transition metal ligand, due to its weak ?-donating and ?-accepting properties.Although, there have been some reports of other enzymes, such as nitrogenase and a multicopper oxidase from Pyrobaculum aerophilum, able to catalyze this reaction in vitro, the only one, whose primary role is the reduction of nitrous oxide, is N2O reductase (NosZ) The general cloning strategy for P+RBS+NosZ+SYFP consists of the following steps.1.The biobrick BBa_K1866001 (NosZ+SYFP) was prepared by Team IIT Delhi iGEM 2015.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BB_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.These genes are contiguous and together with cysH, the gene for 3 -phosphoadenosine 5 -phosphosulfate sulfotransferase, comprise an operon with the gene order promoter-cysJ-cysI-cysHcysJIH operon is part of the positively regulated cysteine regulon (15) and requires sulfur limitationSiR activity is also dependent on cysG, which encodes a uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase necessary for the synthesis of siroheme This gene is located more than 10 min away from cysJIH on the chromosomal map (34) and is not tightly regulated as part of the cysteine regulatory 1.To characterise the Promoter + RBS + nrfA biobrick (Bba_K1866000), we first ran the total protein content of our recombinant E.coli DH5? culture (into which our pSB1A3 plasmid containing the biobrick had been cloned) on an SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel.The stereochemistry of heme attachment is the same in all known examples of heme c, and the vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are attached to the N- and C-terminal Cys of the CXXCH motif, respectively.Other, less common, derivatives of heme include heme d1, present in cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase, heme a, found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the related heme o, found in some bacterial oxidases.From a chemical perspective, hemes b and c are very similar to each other and thus are not expected to display significant inherent differences in electronic structure or reduction potential.In a nutshell, our prototype model is capable of removing the harmful soot particles, gases like NOx and SOx and also the particulate matter present in the exhaust gases of the various engines being used.This was a remarkable discovery as the NRFA bacteria we are working with, effectively reduce NO into harmless forms, and hence we needed NO as the output from this tank.This will also further reduce environmental repercussions as soot now is converted into a useful product, rather than being dumped into the environment To work on developing and optimizing the desooter tank design to reduce power consumption in the blower, as well as the heat exchanger.After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and the pH of the solution was taken for all different concentrations of Nitrite.One of the pathways to its destruction is reduction to molecular nitrogen by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase found in denitrifying bacteria.NosZ, a gene coding for nitrous oxide reductase, isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, is known to convert N2O to harmless Nitrogen gas (N2).After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and nessler\u0092s reagent was added to a 1ml aliquot.These OD values were plotted against DH5? culture, used as control for the experiments.a.Monitoring with time- For a concentration of 1mM Nitrite, multiple cultures were inoculated.The NrfA nitrite reductase is a membrane-associated respiratory enzyme that couples to the membrane-associated formate-oxidizing enzymes via quinones in order to generate membrane potential.The desooter tank has the following main design components: The exhaust gases enter the desooter tank at high temperature(200-250 C), and hence they cause the water in the tank to evaporate when they pass through it.Thus, the tank containing this solvent dissolves soot and NOx, Sox gases move out with the exhaust.The reason for this repression at high nitrite concentrations is the presence of two regulators of the nrfA gene, NarL and NarP, in the E.coli K-12 genome (from where this gene has been isolated).The OD values were more than that of DH5? cultures throughout, pointing to the fact that more ammonia was being formed in our clone cultures.b.Monitoring with different nitrite concentrations- 50 ml Cultures were inoculated with different concentrations of Sodium nitrite.Finally, we came to the conclusion that while expressing NrfA in a constitutive fashion, there was increased conversion of NOx to ammonia.The NirB nitrite reductase is a soluble siroheme-containing enzyme that uses NADH as an electron donor to reduce nitrite in the cytoplasm.Also, another important product of the reaction, NAD(P)+ act as reducing equivalents that are an inherent part of the electron transport system in the host.The nrfA gene is suppressed at higher levels of nitrite or nitrate.Under the constraints of time, we managed to compile the literature, designed the perfect strategy and using Copasi (modelling tool), we found some novel pathways to regulate and manipulate the increase in Heme production and hence the activity of the Heme proteins.It has two copper centers, a binuclear CuA center, similar to the one found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the CuZ center, a unique tetranuclear copper center now known to possess either one or two sulfide bridges[3].(P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.6.The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, whose atmospheric concentration has been increasing since the introduction of the Haber Bosch process led to the widespread use of nitrogenous fertilizers.The remaining exhaust, congaing NOx, Sox and some amount of water vapor now passes over the silica gel tank at the outlet of this desooter tank.SC-R\u0092s are not efficient enough, and thus, do not lead to a significant increase in the trade-off temperature.Nitric oxide (NO) is a proposed intermediate in the six-electron reduction of nitrite and NrfA can use exogenous NO as a substrate.It\u0092s a cross flow type heat exchanger, with which we did some slight innovations to increase the efficiency of the condensation process.Being an acid, it reduces the PH of the medium and hence decreases the solubility of acidic NOx and SOx, from the exhaust into this solvent.From a biosynthetic perspective, however, these types of heme are quite different; because heme c is synthesized from heme b, the use of heme c requires a greater investment from the organism.However, the overall reaction is given by:Thus, the six electron reduction of NO2- to NH3 is catalysed by the nitrite reductase nrfA.NOx sensors placed at the edge of the silica gel tube confirmed that the gel was catalysing the reaction that we intended to do, converting NO2 to NO.To optimize the design of the desooter tank and the entire contraption, to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the process.We tested the model against the exhaust emitted by a diesel engine.But the end product heme acts as a feedback regulator of ALA synthase thereby inhibiting its production.Incomplete heme incorporation into recombinant protein has been a frequently encountered problem .A population of protein will fold without heme cofactor under condition where folding outspaces heme delivery Natural modi?cations to heme occur after the ferrous iron (Fe2) is inserted into the porphyrin by ferrochelatase, the last enzyme in heme biosynthesisCCm complex : It is a complex of Transmembrane protein which helps in Heme maturation .From modelling we believe that by upregulating CCm complex of proteins we can increase heme incorporation into our proteins.We also saw that at concentrations of Nitrite greater than 2mM, the pH showed a sharp decline.Hence, a level meter is required to keep a check on the water level left in the tank, and hence supply fresh water accordingly through the fresh water inlet.While no intermediates of the reaction are released, NrfA is also able to reduce various oxides other than NO such as, hydroxylamine (H2NOH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), but notably also sulfite(SO32-), providing the only known direct link between the nitrogen and sulfur cycles.While scavenging the research papers, we found out that nobody, till date had found a perfect solution for the over expression of Heme protein.In the past, motor vehicle exhaust was an important, but not the main, source of sulfur dioxide in air.This experiment was also successful, with OD values showing a trend similar to the one above.1.The biobrick BBa_K1153001 (NrfA), previously submitted by KENT iGEM 2013 team, was obtained from iGEM repository.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BBa_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.The digestion products were resolved on an Agarose Gel by Electrophoresis and the size of the fragment confirmed the correct clone.The biggest problem which we encountered was that the heme synthesis was much less as compared to our overexpressed protein.The experiment showed results as expected, with the pH of our clones being higher than the control, which can be attributed to the presence of excess ammonia in the solution.For this, we attach a heat exchanger at the outlet of the tank.Escherichia coli possesses two biochemically distinct nitrite reductase enzymes encoded by the nrfABCDEFG and nirBDC operons.We did manage to extensively characterize the NrfA cloned gene, which served as the nitrate reductase.Nitrite, the substrate for the two enzymes, must either be encountered environmentally or generated by the cell from nitrate reduction by one of the three E. coli nitrate reductases.The initial plan was to clone this gene downstream of the CysI gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which codes for sulfite reductase, catalysing the conversion of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide (H2S).So we decided to eliminate soot and NOx as the primary objective.Research was done extensively and the following genes were found to be best fitting for our project-Since Nitric oxide NO is a major greenhouse gas, the reduction of NO from the air is an important task to address global warming concerns.To get rid of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, we decided to use a solution of acetic acid in water as the solvent.This could be due to the fact that high concentrations of nitrite (NO\u00ac2-) become toxic for the cells, due to which cell death occurs.The exhaust out of this tank is now passed into the desooter tank.Thus, the NO rich gas from this tank is passed into the next tank containing NRFA bacteria for further action.This was required so that these excess water vapor do not clog the silica gel at the outlet of the tank.After 16 hours of growth, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD Values were taken.However, we later realised that the pellet was not of our cells, but of ampicillin, which had formed some sort of white precipitate with the media.Conventionally, diesel engines are operated at temperature ranges which are not very high, as operation at high temperature leads to higher amount of NOx in the exhaust.This enzyme is a periplasmic protein and therefore contains a signal sequence to redirect it to the periplasmic space after the protein is formed.The result showed over expression in the range of 55 kDa, which is roughly equal to the size of our protein.2.Periplasmic protein SDS-PAGE\u0097following the over expression obtained from the Poly Acrylamide gel electrophoresis, we extracted the protein content from the periplasmic space using the periplasm fractionation protocol.While working in the project, towards the end, the main complexity we faced was of Heme protein.This culture was then centrifuged at maximum speed (13,400 rpm) for 10 minutes, and the media was decanted and dried out, leaving only the red ammonia pellet.154:349\u0096354 9.Optimization of the heme biosynthesis pathway for the production of 5-aminolevulinic acid in Escherichia coli, Junli Zhang Zhen Kang Jian Chen Guocheng Du 10.The Chemistry and Biochemistry of Heme c: Functional Bases for Covalent Attachment, Sarah E. J.At high nitrite concentrations, the pellet size reduced drastically (the reason being toxicity at high nitrite concentration).1.Clarke, TA., Mills, PC.We observed considerable reduction in the amount of NOx and SOx reduced.We further instigated the problem and found that one of the largest contributions to rising pollution in Delhi is the exhaust from automobiles and other devices using petrol and diesel as fuel.Use the soot (obtained as dissolved in water) to make ink to ultimately make the process self-sustainable and bring down the processing cost to negligible amounts by accounting for commercial selling of this ink obtained.Spargers are needed to form bubbles of exhaust gas in the mixture.The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur.The pathway of the nrfA Gene is still not completely understood or characterised.(P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.6.The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.We performed a double digestion by EcoRI and PstI to release the cloned fragment from the recombinant vector.These ball bearings, through conduction, cool down to acquire the temperature(similar to) of the flow pipes and hence increase the surface area available to the vapor for condensation, speeding up the condensation process.After regular intervals of time, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD540 values were noted.This was run on another polyacrylamide gel, and we saw over expression on this gel as well, on the appropriate range.3.Minimal media growth- Following a research paper by Clarke et al., a culture of our cloned E.coli DH5? culture was grown on a minimal media containing 5% Luria Broth (by volume), 40mM Potassium Nitrate, 20mM Fumarate and 0.4% glycerol for 16 hours, in anaerobic conditions.U.S. EPA then includes these sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) and targets them for federal clean-up activities.We have been successful in cloning a total of 5 relevant bio bricks:We have submitted these parts in the iGEM registry for future use by any iGEM team.U.S. EPA has found hydrogen sulfide in at least 35 of the 1,689 current or former NPL sites.Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) prosthetic groups perform a wide range of functions in nature includingHeme c: heme c has two covalent thioether bonds formed between Cys side chains and the heme vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 .Delhi has been ranked the first most polluted metropolis in the world, and is one of the most heavily polluted cities in India.In the mechanical half of the project, we designed a prototype which in effect served as the perfect \u0093Pollution Crusader\u0094.Blowers are also attached to the system to compensate for the back pressure generated in the system at each step.Cold water flows through the exchanger pipes and steam flows on the outside.In the period between 2000-2011, PM10 levels in Delhi s air jumped by as much as 47 per cent.While either NarL or NarP was able to induce nrfA-lacZ expression in response to low levels of nitrate, only NarL could repress at high nitrate levels.This problem could therefore, be solved, by expressing the nitrite reductase gene under a constitutive strong promoter, which is what we have done.The prototype model designed will not only serve as an alternative for the existing technology, but has the potential to bring revolutionary changes in the upcoming days.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the nation.We here filled the outside of the pipe portion of the exchanger with metal ball bearings.", "design": "", "human_practice": "iGEM team IIT Delhi put up a stall in this event with the goal to motivate and

Synthase) is the committed step of the heme synthesis pathway, and is usually rate-limiting for the overall pathway.As heme synthesis was our fundamental problem, we put on a lot of efforts in modelling it properly.However, the pathway of Heme biosynthesis is extremely complicated.Hence, the following equation governs the production of ALA:The rest of the reactions in this pathway are assumed to proceed via Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics: After putting in the rate laws and the values of various parameters in Copasi software, following graphs were obtained for the concentrations and rate of formation of various species involved (Copasi has been used for obtaining all graphs and mathematical equations):The following are the differential equations associated with the above

Protein System into use on PETase, but, on the basis of the character of PETase degradation, our project has been extended.We have improved the function and characterization of two previously existing BioBrick Part which are created by our own team in a previous year of iGEM(BBa_K1582000&BBa_K1582001).Our particular desigin is shown as follows.Hydrophobin is a small molecular weight protein produced by filamentous fungi, which is characterized by the ability to form a layer of amphiphilic protein membrane at the interface in order to reverse the nature of the interface covered.Utilized amphiphilic and high temperature, acid and alkali resistance characteristics of hydrophobic protein, co-display the PETase and hydrophobic protein on the surface of eukaryotic cells helps in greatly improving the enzyme activity and broaden the reaction conditions of the enzyme.Surface display can improve the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and avoid the trouble of protein purification.This year, we focus on solving the white pollution problem.Due to its amphiphilic nature, the hydrophobic protein binds to the surface of yeast cells spontaneously and binds the hydrophobic surface toward the extracellular side, which adsorbs the PET film through the hydrophobic interaction force.The yeast cell wall is hydrophilic while the hydrophobic protein is hydrophobic.Besides, we used the hydrophobic protein to modify the surface of reaction system to increase its activity.Hydrophobin amphipathicity refers to the hydrophobic nature that the hydrophilic end of a hydrophobin.Frist and the foremost, researchers should analyze the three-dimensional enzyme structure and understand its characteristic for well-directed proceeding to the next section.After that, the system was separated into two parts to improve its activity.The next step has two paths, one is directed mutation, which site is chosen by analyzing the three-dimensional protein structure to find its functional domains, and the other is surface display.According to its self-characteristic, people will do targeted modify on the enzyme in order to an extensive application.We understood more deeply the problem we were facing to solve and how to put the thoughts into reality to solve the white pollution.This time, we put forward a new system about enzymology called Training Protein.", "human_practice": "During the May, we have invite five professors to our forums to discuss with us about our project ideas.Fortunately, a few companies committed to the value of our project and wanted to support us.These events change our way of thinking, and help us have more comprehensive conclusion.Not only do we focus on the future education, but also chasing for a better achievement of our project.And according to our accomplishment with Training Protein System, the value of modified PETase canbe explored more.The talking gives us confident about our project.The best situation is the used microbe can be treated with sterilization reagent, and the soil has already have fungi, it will not be affected.The discussion let us realized that our PETase is vital for environment protection, but its not enough.Then, Tianjin Naipu Technology Co., Ltd suggested that they can provide us some PET samples and we can also go to their factory for a visit.When talking about our project, the manager said that the PETase is one of the best ways of PET degradation.He advised us to sum up the main steps of our experiment and put it into reality.Having listened to the opinions of the experts, we can better our project.And the one who affect us most is Professor Yang from Tianjin University, who is one of the leading experts in structure biology in China.Finally we use the bottles into our experiment as a connection of the lab and the reality.To expand the thought of our project, we go talk with professors and went for visit.Before we leaving, manager gave us some PET samples (plastic films and bottles) as a present.All the professors are have a large stock of knowledge and gave us many useful advises.To test and verify the new system, we put it in use of PETase and finally confirm that the

up into a theory.The manager show us around and introduce the situation about the production, yield, the development of PET industry and so on.After a negotiations, opposite side promised us that we can go to their factory for a visit.After understand our main idea about PETase, the staff said, if our biological method is available, land using efficiency will be greatly accelerated.Additionally, we also harvest a lot of experience and deepen our understanding of our project when going out of school and contacting with workers and experts.During the event of looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained some sponsor fee from the society but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology.During the times, we are inspirited and come up with better ideas and results.In addition, some experts in companies talked with us very friendly and put forward useful suggestions for us although they did not provide financial support.It s believed that collecting the opinions and suggestions

the assumptions as the reverse reaction rate is zero, so the constant valve of k6 is zero and the equation-14 can change into:The above differential equation is the final rate equation of the whole reaction process, and from the equation-15 we can see that the reaction rate is a constant, D. And the reaction rate constants were different at different PET concentrations and different PET films.As can be seen from the above reaction kinetics model, the whole reaction rate is a constant after reaching the adsorption equilibrium.Third, the effect of reaction area in the hydrolysis process can be well considered by taking the adsorption process into account.In this part, we choose the Langmuir isothermal adsorption equation to describe the first step in the reaction process, the combination of the PET film and the PET enzyme.We needn\u0092t to take the reaction rate of the first reaction equation into account because it has been calculated in the adsorption part and the differential equation of the remaining two reaction rate as follows:so the following equation can be gotten by putting the relationship equation of the concentration of PET\u0095S and the PET film\u0092s area into the above differential equation:And combine the above equation and the equation of dimensionless Langmuir adsorption equation, we can get: Now, let\u0092s analyze the parameters of the above equation.There are three reasons we choose two steps, adsorption and reaction, to describe the process of PET enzymatic hydrolysis reaction: First, the adsorption process has a greater impact on the PET enzymatic hydrolysis process which we can\u0092t ignore.The general adsorption image of this equation in a typical solution is shown in picture 1:Here we assume that the PET enzyme adsorption process in accordance with the adsorption process in the picture above.It\u0092s used in this situation as well, so the double reciprocal equation is:So if we have the experimental data by experimenting with quartz crystal microbalance to detect the adsorption capacity of PET, we can get the constant ?max and Ka through the equation above.b. Schematic diagram of the combination of the PET enzyme and reaction products while the hydrolysis reaction is happening.When the enzyme adsorbed on the PET film is released after the reaction, a new PET enzyme will be adsorbed on the PET immediately from the picture 2, so the adsorption equilibrium is not broken.At last, the third step is the hydrolysis reaction and the three-step reaction equations as follows:In the above equation, the meaning of each symbol represents as follows: PET\u0095S: The middle state of PET enzyme adsorption on the surface of PET sheet.In order to apply this equation to solve the reaction kinetics problem well, some assumptions are given follows: B.The adsorption of PET enzyme on the PET-solid-surface is monomolecular layer.While, in fact, the product of the hydrolysis reaction, BHET and MHET shown a competitive inhibition of the hydrolytic activity of PET enzyme against PET sheet, which would decrease the free concentration of free enzyme in the solution according to Markus Barth.And through this reaction rate equation we can get different reaction rate in the condition of different PET film and PET enzyme initial PET enzyme concentration.In our case, in order to predict the optimum condition of recombination cell decomposing PET, it was carried out the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis model.In this way, we put the Langmuir adsorption equation linked with the second step of hydrolysis reaction process, here, the equation above is the key to connect the two step, and the valve of the CPET\u0095S will be used in the next part.Because the reaction time relative to the adsorption time is so long that the time to achieve the adsorption equilibrium can be negligible, while, after reaching the maximum adsorption quantity, new PET enzyme will be adsorbed on the PET sheet soon whenever there is some PET enzyme reaction with PET to release the products.It\u0092s obvious that K, k3, Ka are constant in the system, while, in a fixed experiment, the area of the PET sheet and the concentration of the PET enzyme are unchangeable according to hypothesizes above, so the right part of the equation above is a constant, B.There are three main steps in the whole process on the basis of the given assumptions above, the first step is the former part which describes the adsorption process and the second step is the effective combination for enzyme catalytic reaction of the PET film and the PET enzyme on the basis of the physical adsorption.So the valve of the character, B, is not a constant because the valve of the concentration of PET enzyme, Ef, is changeable with the reaction time.D.The adsorption process of PET enzyme on the PET-solid-surface will come a dynamic equilibrium after a certain time.It\u0092s known that the general enzymatic reaction rate is far faster than diffusion rate, so, in this process, the hydrolysis reaction is very important as well as the diffusion adsorption process.As we all know, the symbol C means the concentration of the material, so we can get that CPET\u0095S is the concentration of the adsorption combination state of the PET film and the PET enzyme; CPETS is the concentration of the effective combined of the PET film and the PET enzyme; CS is the concentration of the free PET enzyme in the solution and CDTP is the concentration of the product, dimethyl terephthalate.So we can get:The parameter valves can be given according to the literature and experimental data:So the image of the reaction rate with the time under the condition of the A=28.27mm2, and E0=4\u00d710-3 is shown in the picture 3.Picture 3: The image of the reaction rate with the time.From the picture above, we can get that the reaction rate will decrease with the time because of the reaction products\u0092 prohibition.Here, we use the character PET\u0095S represent the middle state of PET enzyme adsorption on the surface of PET sheet.It avoid the solving process of the ?max needing the adsorption experiment by quartz crystal microbalance which would cost a lot of time.The model of PET enzymatic hydrolysis process is made up of two parts.E. The enzymatic reaction is carried out only on the solid surface of the PET sheet, and the PET enzyme won\u0092t enter the interior of the PET, and the solubility of the PET in the solution is zero.According to Markus Barth, we can know that the products such as: TPA, MHET, EG and BHET have a competence of combining with the PET enzyme, what\u0092s more, MHET and BHET are powerful in this.According to the Langmuir theory, the adsorption isotherm equation is:In the above equation, ? is the quality of PET enzyme adsorption by unit quality PET, g; ?max is the maximum adsorption of PET enzyme by unit quality PET, g; Ka is the adsorption dissociation constant, mL/g; Ef is the concentration of free PET enzyme in the solution, g/mL.In general, we use the double reciprocal method to find the adsorption constant of the Langmuir equation.Figure1 is a surf picture of our model, while Figure2 is a slice picture for our convenience in observing the details.Figure4: 4-D surf picture of Relative Enzyme ActivityFigure 5: 4-D slice picture of Relative Enzyme ActivityWe established the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis model established based on experimental data and find the mathematical expression of the efficiency of recombination cell decomposing PET.But the reaction rate shouldn\u0092t be a constant according to our experimental results in the whole process which indicates that the reaction products has a certain effect on the process.While it\u0092s no time for us to do so many adsorption process experiments, so it\u0092s the other way we need to seek in order to solve the reaction kinetics problem well.While the combination of the PET enzyme and the products reduces the PET enzyme concentration in solution which moves the adsorption equilibrium to deduce the maximum adsorption capacity and equilibrium adsorption capacity.This isothermal adsorption equation is suitable for the case where there is only one adsorbed species, while the PET adsorption process is just this one.So the concentration of this PET\u0095S can be achieved through the following equation:While in the above equation, K is a constant connecting the three characters and A represents the area of the PET film.And as we always know, the maximum adsorption capacity is certainly proportional to the area of the PET film, so the concentration of the combination state of the PET enzyme and PET film in the whole system is related to the PET film area and dimensionless adsorption capacity.D. The time to achieve the equilibrium of the adsorption reaction can be ignored.In this model, only the PET enzyme binds to the PET sheet and the PET is insoluble in the solution.DTP: The main product of PET hydrolysis, dimethyl terephthalate.According to combining the Langmuir equation and the reaction rate equation we get a heterogeneous kinetic model.The illustration is shown below by picture-2:Picture 2:a.The state of the adsorption without hydrolysis reaction happened.So the valve of the constant ?max and Ka is not wanted if we can get the reaction kinetics equation finally through another way.We set three variables as the reaction conditions in our model, which are the time(x1) and temperature(x2) of protein-induced expression and the cell concentration(x3).k1-6: The reaction constant of each reaction equation.So the kinetic equation eventually needs to be corrected which we will cover in the next section.In this part, our goal is to deduce the chemical reaction rate.So the Langmuir adsorption equation can be converted into the next form:The maximum adsorption capacity of the solution will be avoided by using this model.C.No intermolecular forces between the PET enzyme molecules.Here we only consider the main obstacles, BHET and MHET, even though we ignore these by-products because they are so few, but their influence on the adsorption can\u0092t be excluded.We can get that when it\u0092s 18 hours later, the reaction rate is zero which is in accordance with the experimental results that when we extend the reaction time the products won\u0092t increase.Effect of hydrolysis products on the enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate nanoparticles by a polyester hydrolase from Thermobifida fusca.The change of the area of the PET sheet is assumed to be negligible due to the slow rate of PET decomposition.Turbidimetric analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate nanoparticles.PETS: The binding state of PET in the PET enzyme active site.We made a 4-dimension picture to show the relationship between the selected three conditions and the PET decomposition efficiency using our fitting model.The experimental data of one experiment group we used is shown in table2.Table 2: Relative Enzyme Activity of E-coli with INP(ice nucleation protein)The results of our model are as follows.The reverse reaction rate is assumed to be zero as the quality of cis-reaction products is negligible compared to the amount of solution due to the slow cis-reaction rate.We consider that the reaction efficiency correlates with the protein-induced expression time logarithmically, and correlates with the temperature of protein-induced reaction and cell concentration quadratically.", "notebook": "Cultivation of PETase in

so that it can break down methane by cloning and expressing the sMMO of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath).The sMMO operon of M. capsulatus (Bath), figure 1, has ten known protein encoding genes, summarized in Table 1.Our team wants to engineer E. coli in order for it to break down methanol to biomass by cloning and expressing the genes methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) Hps and Phi are both part of the fixation phase of the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway and convert formaldehyde to hexolose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate respectively .Since methanol, the breakdown product of methane, is poisonous, we will also implement the Ribulose-Monophosphate (RuMP)- pathway from Bacillus methanolicus to convert methanol to biomass in three steps.Since we want to clone the genes that form the enzyme complex sMMO and use them to construct our own sMMO operon for expression in E. coli, the genes mmoQ, mmoS, and mmoR are not relevant and thus excluded from our project.Figure 1: sMMO operon of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath)adapted from Scarlan et.Characterization of MMOD, a long overlooked component of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).cloned the sMMO genes of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath) for the purpose of expressing them in Escherichia coli (E. coli).The two iron ions, the electrons (which change the iron ions), and the oxygen together with methane in the center of MMOH (bound to MMOB) make the magic happen to break one C-H bond in methane to a C-OH.To date there are two enzyme complexes known that can do the task of breaking methane; soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO), and the membrane bound particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO)1\u00963.15, 205\u009656 (2015).Cs\u00e1ki, R., Bodrossy, L., Klem, J., Murrell, J.

Involvement of MmoR and MmoG in the transcriptional activation of soluble methane monooxygenase genes in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b.It is in this diiron center of MMOH where the actual conversion of methane to methanol takes place.At low copper levels however, sMMO is expressed which uses iron-ions in the enzyme core for breaking methane.2\u00964 The methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (M. capsulatus (Bath)) is one of the most studied methanotrophs that has both pMMO and sMMO.Both enzymes break methane with the following reaction: Other than that they both can convert methane to methanol and require oxygen for the process, are they structurally very different.MMOG is thought to be a chaperone which will properly fold the sMMO proteins.More technical information about the specific functions of each sMMO subproteins after the summary.sMMO is build out of 5 proteins, whereof MMOX, MMOY, MMOZ form one protein complex called MMOH.MMOH, the hydroxylase, consist of three subunits ? (60.6 kDa), ? (45.1 kDa), and ? (19.8kDa), encoded by mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ2.Nerveless the different variance found within the other two phases of the RuMP cycle can all be expressed in E.coli too.The surrounding air will be pumped through the filter so the methane gas can be taken up by E. coli and be converted to biomass.All enzymes needed for the serine cycle, except three are present in E. coli.pMMO is expressed at high copper levels, which makes sense as it uses copper in the core of the enzyme to break the strong C-H bond in methane.Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and is leaked into the atmosphere at different natural and industrial places.Afterward helps MMOC to release methanol and resets MMOH by providing new electrons1,3.Figure 2: Overview of the sMMO protein with subunits ?,?, and ? of MMOH, and MMOB, MMOD, and MMOR.There is not much known about the function of the 12 kDa protein MMOD, formerly known as orfY.al 2009Six of the other seven genes, mmoX, mmoY, mmoZ, mmoB, mmoC, and, mmoD, encode the proteins of the sMMO complex.One aspect is that serine does not utilize formaldehyde directly, but it is added into the cycle in order to form serine.Determination by X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Fe-Fe separation in the oxidized form of the hydroxylase of methane monooxygenase alone and in the presence of MMOD.Compared to the serine cycle the RuMP cycle only needs two additional genes added to E.coli compared to the serine cycle that needs three.Even better, the enzyme  that these methanotrophs use can breakdown methane at ambient temperatures and pressure.6-9Thus if we could understand and use this enzyme it would be possible to develop tools to minimize the methane leakage at many places like barns and gas hydrates.Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde in all aerobic methylotrophes by the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase (Medh).Previous studies have shown that the most relevant pathway for this project are the RuMP pathway and the serine cycle.Methanol is an one carbon structure that is toxic to the cell.MMOD, encoded by mmoD, is thought to inhibit the process by blocking the binding of either MMOB or MMOC to MMOH.The last gene, mmoG, encodes for the protein MMOG, is not previously been uses in a iGEM project.In this step three enzymes have to be added in E. coli in order to go from methanol to fructose-6-phosphate; methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi).In another iron monooxygenase, Bacterial binuclear iron monooxygenases, a similar protein as MMOG called mimG was needed for proper folding of one of the other monooxygenase proteins6.Further studies are needed to resolve the functionality of MMOD both in vitro and in vivo.The mmoG gene is suggested to encode a GroEL-like chaperone that contributes to the correct folding of the other sMMO proteins5,6, but this is so far not proven.The first group showing that MMOD is expressed in M. capsulatus (Bath), also has evidence that MMOD can bind to the hydroxylase MMOH7.A big part of the industrial methane emission is in the agricultural sector in places like Gas hydrates are trapped ice-like crystals of gas that are only stable in a specific temperature and pressure range.& Sugimoto, S. Bacillus subtilis yckG and yckF Encode Two Key Enzymes of the Ribulose Monophosphate Pathway Used by Methylotrophs, and yckH Is Required for Their Expression.In addition will we clone the mmoG gene of the sMMO operon which is thought to encode a chaperone (MMOG) involved in folding of the other MMO proteins5,6.Nature 523, 534\u00965 (2015).Liikanen, A., Silvennoinen, H. & Karvo, A. Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in two coastal wetlands in the northeastern Gulf of Bothnia, Baltic Sea.* Formaldehyde to hexulose-6-phosphate with the enzyme 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (hxlA)* Hexulose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate with the enzyme 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (hxlB)  A closed container to restrict the genetically modified E. coli.A third gene, mmoR, encoding the protein  MMOR , is a transcriptional activator of the whole sMMO operon3\u00965.Two genes, mmoQ, and, mmoS, coding for the proteins MMOQ and MMOS can sense copper and play a role in regulating transcription of the sMMO operon3\u00965.Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) are the two enzymes involved in the fixation phase.They did show that MMOG (and  MMOR ) are required for protein binding to the promoter region of the sMMO operon in the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b5.However, the oxidation can occur in two different pathways.Biochemistry 54, 2283\u009694 (2015).Sazinsky, M. H. & Lippard, S. J. Methane monooxygenase: functionalizing methane at iron and copper.Medh2 was therefore found to be the best candidate of the three to use in this project2.Or even better, one could convert methane to methanol or biomass so it can be more easily transported and used as a bio-fuel instead of being discarded.Hps and Phi are found in most methylotrophes, but different methylotrophes have different genes involved in the cleavage and rearrangement phase.So that the PPQ biosynthetic pathway has to be cloned into E.coli or PPQ has to be added to the growth medium.The other pathway to consider is the serine pathway.It seems that MMOD binds to MMOH in competition with the regulatory protein MMOB, which hints to an inhibitory function of MMOD7.Examples of non-orthologs pathway are ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, the tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathway, and the gluthione-linked pathway.That is why we want to implement MMO into Escherichia coli (E. coli) so that it can breakdown methane.Sazinsky, M. H. & Lippard, S. J. Methane monooxygenase: functionalizing methane at iron and copper.These bound subunits form again a dimer, resulting in ?2?2?2, with in the middle a  canyon .On each of the ??? subunits is a binding site for either MMOB, the regulator, or MMOC, the reductase2.Binding of MMOB to MMOH is needed for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation (the actual breaking of the C-H to C-OH bonding)2.The group of microorganism that has the ability to grow with only a one carbon compounds as the single carbon source are called methylotrophes1.MMOC transfers the two electrons from NADH to the diiron site in MMOH2.The goal of this final step is to break down methanol to biomass, so E. coli can utilize methanol as an energy source.Preparation and X-ray structures of metal-free, dicobalt and dimanganese forms of soluble methane monooxygenase hydroxylase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).The NAD-linked cytoplasmic enzyme was therefor chosen because only one additional gene is needed and it utilizes the electron acceptor already found in E. coli.However, there is no known activation enzyme or sufficient flux for the process of condensation of formaldehyde2.What this means is that only two additional genes, Hps and Phi, have to be added to E.coli in order for RuMP cycle to perform its function.PLoS One 8, e59188 (2013).Ochsner, A. M., M\u00fcller, J. E. N., Mora, C. A.They also showed a possible involvement of MMOD in the assembly of the metal center in MMOH7\u00969.All three Medhs have been tested under different conditions and it was found that Medh2 showed similar activity in E. coli lysate as B. methanolicus under similar conditions.Hydroxylation means the adding of an -OH group, in this case the change of methane to methanol (CH4 to CH3-OH) which happens inside MMOH.15, 205\u009656 (2015).Zhang, Y., Xin, J., Chen, L. & Xia, C.

facilities, and cattle farms.We have devided our activities under the categories Our project was inspired by the possibility of capturing methane emissions in facilities where methane is produced, and converting this methane into a useful product.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "", "protocol": "The amount of formed NADH can be measured at a wavelength of 340 nm.The formation of NADH is proportional to the amount of methanol converted into formaldehyde.To get a hint about the background in our reaction we established two controls:  E. coli strain expressing MEDH2 but methanol was not added to the assay reaction In a second approach we wanted to determine the in vivo activity of heterologous expressed MEDH2 in E. coli.During the conversion of methanol into formaldehyde NAD+ is used as a cofactor, leading to the formation of NADH.Protein expression under control of a T7 promoter can be induced by adding Isopropyl-?-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG).Figure 1: Schematic overview of the pET28a or pET30a vector with a T7 promoter, a ribosomal binding site (RBS) followed by our gene of interest.With PCR we added restriction enzyme sites at the 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 end of CDS of each gene.The codonoptimized mmoG as well as all three genes encoding the enzymes for the methanol to biomass conversion (medh2, hps, and phi) were created as The CDS of the hps gene, encoding the 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase, contains PstI and XbaI restriction sites making it not compatible with the BioBrick system.The concentration of formaldehyde is proportional to the concentration of DDL, which can be calculated using the Beer\u0096Lambert law.Instead mmoG was synthesized by IDT as a gBlock gene fragment, codon optimized for protein expression in E. coli.The second project part had the intention to create four new basic BioBrick parts.During the conversion of methanol into formaldehyde NADH is generated.The production of NADH can be measured at a wavelength of 340 nm.Figure 1:Schematic overview of in vitro assay of NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase.Thereby the Beer\u0096Lambert law can be used to calculate the concentration of NADH which corresponds to the concentration of produced formaldehyde.Imidazole is an organic compound and replaces the tagged protein in the interaction with the Ni-NTA chelate complex.To characterize the functionality of the NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase (medh2) two different approaches were chosen.Formaldehyde will react with components in the Nash reagent to form 3,5-Diacetyl-1,4-Dihydro-2,6-Lutidine (DDL.In the presence of formaldehyde it leads to the formation of 3,5-Diacetyl-1,4-Dihydro-2,6-Lutidine (DDL).Genes encoding the enzymes for the conversion of methanol into biomass (medh2, hps, and phi) were amplified by PCR from Bacillus methanolicus (MGA3) genomic DNA and TOPO blunt end cloning into the pCR4 vector was performed.By detecting the absorption at 412 nm, the formation of DDL can be measured.In two rounds of in vitro mutagenesis both restriction sites were removed and hps was cloned into pSB1C3 and submitted as a Before assembling the final constructs we wanted to show that each individual protein could be expressed in E. coli.Afterwards the gene was cloned either into pET-30 or pET-28 with the use of the listed restriction enzymes.Furthermore it is necessary to show if the heterologous expressed proteins are soluble expressed and not aggregated into inclusion bodies.Primers were designed in a way that they bind in the 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 untranslated region (UTR) of each gene.TOPO blunt end cloning of mmoG did not succeed.Aggregation in inclusion bodies prevents a proper folding and thereby proper function of the protein.Those basic parts consist of the coding sequences (CDS) of a gene.Addition of imidazol removes the polyhistidine tagged protein from the chelate complexe.For the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) we got the genes for the subunits (mmoXYZBCD) cloned into the BioBrick standard vector pSC1B3 from the Those six parts are registered as BioBrick parts under the names; Bba_K1390001 (mmoB), Bba_K1390002

wanted to show particular protein expression of each subunit into E. coli.We made hps compatible to the BioBrick system removing a XbaI and PstI restriction site by in-vitro mutagenesis and generated a basic BioBrick part (BBa_K1619002) .These BioBricks contain the original genomic sequences of medh2, hps and phi.We expressed MEDH2 in E. coli and purified the enzyme.Figure 5: Sequencing of hps

is powerful or not.We took advantage of the high precision and programmability of light system and the specificity and the convenience from a Cas9-recombinase hybrid.Thus, combined with our light-switch, the user is able to gain better control over the bacteria\u0092s metabolism pathways.With this information storage platform in hand, what can we do in the future?The controlling circuit utilizes 3 AT89S52-24PU DIP-40 SCMs (single chip microcomputer) to execute programmed-controlling of the 24 tri-color LEDs, while the computer interacting port monitors the whole system through given protocol sequences.Green-light system do not represent none of two types of binary information, instead it acts as a license that allows the recombines to work [4].The E-code 1.0 software system aims to provide convenient commanding for users of the E-light hardware system.For the Cas9-recombinsae system we selected recombinase system as the tool to edit the gene due to its specificity for consensus sequences.Adding NOT and OR gates downstream the light system might render the system more complex and therefore available for better information storing capacity.We also would be able to develop better encoding algorithm to integrate more information into the bacterial genome and in a more versatile way.In order to build an information storage platform described above we devised a hardware assisted by a software that can eventually convert any form of profile into biological meaningful information.It is not hard to imagine a world where you can simply store any kind of digital information you want into the bacteria, and break the storing limitation of general electrical device.In order to utilize the light as an input signal, we have to first test its basic parameters which can be refer to.For example, we can denote the blue-light system to control information containing \u00930\u0094 whereas the red-light system to control information containing \u00931\u0094.With more delicate design and further investigation into this system, we can take our platform onto a whole new level.We adapted an engineering strategy onto these two component system by combining different modules and components from different species in order to achieve highest efficiency [2].We additionally built a model of the relationship between the light input and the protein expression output based on previous results.All being said, we still needed to first determine the basic parameter of this inducible system.Again, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out, turning out to be promising to ensure that inducible system can work successfully in E. coli.A straightforward strategy is to use light-switchable two-component system to directly control the gene-editing hybrid.We received quite convincing results to support that light-switchable two-component system can work successfully in E. coli.At present our system can theoretically encode and encrypt any form of file and convert their binary data stream into biological meaningful information, i.e.The light-exposure & bacterial culture system is based on a 24-well plate coupled with tri-color LEDs.We therefore complemented this system by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, because it is guided by a sgRNA pair that is not limited to specific sequences.Given the ideas come up with above, how can we put all parts together in order to store information within the E. coli?Using smaller Cas9 endonuclease is also a must when considering transforming the entire plasmid into the bacteria, which is actually a metabolic burden for the cell.[2] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].", "design": "The green-light system works an extremely similar way to that of the blue light system: it is comprised of two essential components, a light sensor and a response regulator.The red-light system used in our project consists of two components, a membrane-bound light sensor Cph8 and a response regulator OmpR [3].Light-switchable two-component system (TCS) is one example of how light signal can be wired into the metabolic pathway within the bacteria [3].Additionally, there are two components within: a light sensor and a response regulator, the former sensing the incoming light and responding to it by changing the conformation, the latter reacting to the sensor and turning on or off the gene expression due to its transcriptional factor nature.The principle behind light-switchable two-component system goes like this: When a beam of light hits on the bacteria, the effector module in the sensor, i.e., the HK domain, will change its confirmation accordingly, therefore its catalytic activity transits from a phosphokinase to a phosphatase.In this system, a J? chain is introduced to link the light sensor and effector together, of which the conformation change is induced, switching the YF1 (the fusion protein) from a kinase to a phosphatase.The blue-light-sensitive LOV domain in its soluble light sensor YF1 is derived from a protein termed YtvA from B. subtilis, whereas the histidine kinase domain derived from the protein FixL and the response regulator FixJ are found B. japonicum.As a result, a recombinase system is the most ideal candidate when looking for an information storing executor.Thus, the response regulator, FixJ, is dephosphorylated and deprived of the ability to drive FixK2-promotor-regulated gene expression [3].Since that there is an endogenous expression level of red-light system in E. coli, a bacterial knock-out technique is introduce to avoid a potentially confusing result [4].To be more specific, a light sensor is made up of two modules: an actual light sensor and an effector which possesses both kinase and phosphatase activity.As a result, RR cannot recognize its downstream target sequence and cannot activate the expression of the reporter gene.As is indicated by its nomenclature, this system is switchable \u0096 it has two interchangeable states when stimulated by different light conditions.With the advancement of gene editing technology, today CRISPR/Cas9 system has been exploited to carry out a myriad of functions, such as knock-out and knock-down of a certain gene, single molecule imaging, etc.It turns out that the inducible ccdB system works perfectly well, so it is competent to be used to screen the optimal distance between sgRNA pairs and an appropriate linker choice.Cas9, an endonuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes, can target and cleave specific DNA sequences that are next to the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) when provided with a guide RNA.Different light systems generally do not interfere with each other, and therefore can be stimulated and silenced in parallel [2].Here, however, the light sensor module is designated as Cyb, along with its histidine kinase, constituting the light sensor component CcaS.The light sensor is made up of a red-light-sensitive cyanobacterial phytochrome sensor module Phy derived from a protein called Cph1 from S. PCC 6803, and a histidine kinase domain from a protein called EnvZ from E. coli.Generally, two families of recombinase have been identified: the tyrosine recombinase and the serine recombinase [5].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].In this way, precise gene editing and information storing can be achieved by utilizing the light system to regulate the dCas9-recombinase hybrid.In addition, the inducible ccdB system has other potential future applications.That is to say, we still count on the specificity and accuracy of recombinase, but meanwhile we need the assistance from Cas9.We established a model of the inducible ccdB system indicating the relationship between iPTG addition and OD value after discussing parameters of iPTG, ccdB, relative concentration of bacteria, and OD value measured.After successfully constructing all the systems required and confirming its efficacy, we can bridge the light-switchable TCS and the dCas9-recombines system together.CRISPR-Cas9 system is a newly developed gene-editing tool that breaks the limit of specific recognition sites.Consequently it is regarded as a complementary DNA cutter that is not restricted to recognize unique sequences, but is versatile that can recognize any sequence within the genome guided by its sgRNA.This means that if current information storage capacity is not enough, we do not need to search for a new recombinase, instead changing the sgRNA pairs can solve the problem.Engineering Escherichia colito see light[J].Therefore, if we have to choose one form of signal as the input, the optical input is favored [1].A pair of sgRNAs targeting the sense and antisense strand of the DNA sequence guide the fusion protein to the location, and the recombinase part of the fusion protein carries out deletion or inversion of the DNA segment.The blue light system follows similar principles, containing two components as well.Of course, it is easy to understand why we then turn to Cas9 and see if it can overcome the specificity issue from recombinase issue [6].There are two commonly used gene-editing tools: site-specific recombinase and CRISPR-Cas9 system.Following the guidance of sgRNAs, Cas9 endonuclease can be used to modify any site of the genome conveniently.Along ccdB\u0092s sequence we designed 25 and 24 sgRNAs targeting each strand of the DNA.However, accurate deletion or inversion, a vital aspect to consider when devising an information storing platform, are hard to accomplish because of double-strand breaks introduced by Cas9 endonuclease.With this new tool we don\u0092t need to bother considering and introducing recognition sites of the recombinases anymore.Also, without causing double-strand breaks, gene editing can be safer and more accurate [6].In other words, a major drawback of this information-storing platform is that every time a new recombinase has to be used when increasing the storing capability.[1] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].The response regulator is derived from OmpR of which the recognition site is a promoter named OmpC.Site-specific recombinase is an endonuclease that is capable of inserting, deleting and inverting a DNA fragment within the recognition site.In our system, three mainstream light systems we took advantage of all follow this basic scheme.Second, easy access and low cost renders light system frequently used.Effects of different designs of linkers are also tested using this inducible ccdB system.We built an inducible ccdB screening system for it.Refactoring and optimization of light-switchable Escherichia coli two-component systems[J].The sensor and the effector interact closely in order to give a precise light-induced response.Recombinases were previously utilized to accomplish information storage in biological systems due to its specificity [7].Although the screening work wasn\u0092t finished, a linker choice and distance between two sgRNAs worked finely.Three types of TCS are now the most commonly investigated, including red, blue and green light system, named by at which wavelength the system is responsive.Addition of iPTG induces expression of ccdB and then bacteria get killed, but if ccdB gene is successfully disrupted by dCas9 recombinase, then the bacteria survive.[7] Yang L, Nielsen A A K, Fernandez-Rodriguez J, et al.", "human_practice": "In addition to our telling the story of iGEM and some previous interesting projects, we encouraged them to form several temporary teams, which enabled them to exchange their preliminary ideas relevant to feasible iGEM projects.The most impressive part came when the representative of every group shared the amazing thoughts of their discussion, and those brave students were awarded with small souvenirs.The public we targeted to were mainly consisted of three groups listed below: students from other iGEM teams, freshmen from the School of Life Science in Tsinghua this year and some high school students who showed great interest in our project and daily experiment.Freshmen major in Biology always look forward to their research life in the future with enormous passion every year.At last, we received many reflections and encouragements written on the leaflet from them, which made us feel even more hopeful when thinking about

communication between teams was realized while we got helpful advice at the same time.We decided to create a chance for high school students to experience experiments in the lab after we got to know their desire for practical attempt based on theoretical knowledge learned in class.Contacted successfully on May 18th, these senior three students from RDFZ visited the lab on May 24th for the first

GFP, will be expressed when bacteria carrying this plasmid are provided with blue light.Add gradients of 0.1% iPTG to bacteria suspension.In this experiment, we used a recombinase system to insert a Kanamycin gene into the genomic region where we want to target and then utilized other recombinase to remove the Kanamycin gene.For the red light system, we transformed a plasmid containing the entire red light system (Cph8, HO1 and PcyA), along with a promoter, a terminator and an OmpR regulated reporter.Therefore, when bacteria carrying this gene are provided with the red light, the reporter cannot be synthesized.The result supported this prediction because we can observe a distinctive expression pattern between the treated (provided with red light) and untreated (kept in dark) group.Eventually, we successfully fused two proteins with the seamless cloning, as is supported by the appearance of 4-5kb bands in nearly all lanes.In addition, we added a roughly 36bp linker between the two in order to increase its flexibility.As can be seen in Figure 3, roughly 1kb bands appear nearly in every lane, supporting that our knock-out system was effective.In this experiment, we planned to fuse two proteins, a recombinase and a Cas9, together.(c) Measure OD600 value of each dilution of the suspension, using liquid LB as blank.", "safety": "Before we started our project, all of our team members had received lab safety training, including standard experimental protocols, disposal of waste, information on hazardous chemicals and proper use of biosafety cabinets etc.The risks to team members were minimized by wearing appropriate PPEs in the lab all the time and following lab safety regulations of Tsinghua University.In order to avoid that problem, all members in the team were instructed of how to distribute and utilize this gene with specific orientation.Since that ccdB is an inhibitor of DNA gyrase and therefore interferes with normal bacterial activity, any improper disposal of ccdB protein and plasmids containing ccdB gene will pose serious results to the natural bacterial communities.In addition, since that ccdB is not harmful for human beings, it is trustworthy and safe to use this protein to kill the bacteria.In one of our experimental design, a lethal protein ccdB was used to screen for successful dCas9-recombinase hybrid design.Therefore, it\u0092s reasonable to conclude that our hardware is harmless.The E. coli we involved in the whole project was lab safe strain DH5?.", "keywords": "chromoprotein encouraged references respiration

2440  Prof. Ohad Medalia, Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich, Switzerland.", "background": "", "description": "bacteria that is able to respire its excess electrons through electrodes),  and since PET is a polymer that contains a large amount of energy in its carbon-carbon bonds,  excess energy released by our engineered P. putida from terephthalate degradation will be harnessed and utilized in a microbial fuel cell (MFC),  leading to an efficient and energy producing, rather than consuming, degradation of PET.In order to achieve symbiosis between our two chosen bacterial species we have separated them using a dialysis membrane so that the E. coli, secreting the LC-Cutinase and utilizing ethylene glycol is enclosed and separated from the P. putida which is utilizing the terephthalic acid that diffuses out of the dialysis bag.Their mutual dependence depends on the fact that terephthalate will be the sole carbon source for P. putida s growth, and cannot be generated in the absence of E. coli secreting LC-cutinase, while E. coli will not survive in elevated levels of terephthalate, that has to be degraded by P. putida, thus engineering a symbiotic dependence between the two bacterial species.Our goal is to genetically engineer P. putida so it will contain two plasmids which will encode for two essential components: a membrane transporter that will carry the terephthalate molecule into the cell and the necessary genes for its degradation.We plan to insert a degradation pathway for terephthalate into P. putida using genetic engineering, while the other monomer of PET, ethylene glycol, is utilized by E. coli that secretes our improved LC-Cutinase protein.The terephthalate degradation pathway, derived from a strain of Commamonas testosteroni , terminates in protocatechuate, a toxic molecule for most bacteria, however, P. putida, is able to utilize it as a carbon source for its growth (Jimenez et al 2002).LC-Cutinase is an enzyme discovered from an unknown organism in leaf-branch compost, and has been found to be one of the most efficient enzymes in breaking down PET polymers with relatively high crystallinity into degradable products, the monomers ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.This way, we hope to achieve a full degradation of the two PET products and with it to drive the PET biocatalysis reaction by LC-Cutinase forward.This energy can be utilized in a future device for the maintenance of growth conditions or the pretreatment of PET to render it easily degraded by the engineered bacteria.We have chosen to work with P. putida, which is a gram-negative bacterium, for its diverse metabolism, including the ability to degrade organic solvents, especially protocatechuate, a toxic substance for most bacteria, its similarity to E. coli in most laboratory protocols and its electrochemical properties which allow it to be used in our fuel cell.Based on the LC-Cutinase structure that was solved in 2014 (Sulaiman et al 2014), we have chosen to use a rational mutagenesis approach for its improvement.We decided to achieve this by genetic engineering of metabolic pathways of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida (P. putida).The ethylene glycol degradation pathway, present in our chosen E. coli strain, BL-21, supplies a carbon source for its growth while degrading PET to its respective monomers with LC-Cutinase.The two bacteria will metabolize the two PET degradation products - leading to the conversion of PET to CO2.In addition, current solutions for the disposal of PET, such as recycling and burying are also energy consuming as they require means such as transportation,  sorting and initial processing.Many ideas were considered in dealing with plastic waste such as burning plastic or burying it, but these solutions are considered damaging to the environment due to plastics toxicity.In addition, the pelB leader sequence was fused to the enzyme in its N terminus and was expressed and secreted to the growth media of E. coli.Next, we wanted to fully degrade the resulting monomers to CO2, this way no toxic molecules will remain as products of the degradation process.With the advancements made in the field of polymer chemistry during the 20th century,  many new polymers were introduced into industry and are known to us today as Polystyrene, Polyethylene and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET).Since the introduction of plastics, some microbial communities or species have evolved to successfully degrade plastics, however,  from an evolutionary point of view, probably due to the relatively short period of exposure to plastics,  they are yet to be efficient in plastic biodegradation.However, one of its best features was found to be one of its greatest drawbacks, the durability of plastic makes it virtually non-degradable.Using this approach, we made various mutations using an algorithm developed by Dr. Sarel Fleishman of the Weizmann Institute of Science (Goldenzweig et al.In order to offer a better alternative to the existing solutions we decided to explore options which would allow us to maintain a positive energy balance.Our goal as the Ben-Gurion University IGEM team of 2016 is to overcome this evolutionary hurdle by devising several approaches using synthetic biology tools for efficient plastic biodegradation.Genomic analysis of the aromatic catabolic pathways from Pseudomonas putida KT2440.", "design": "To provide us with a versatile vector, that will allow excision of a specific sequence from the designed insert if needed,  we added a restriction site between each element (gene or RBS).M259F - A \u0091hole\u0092 inside the protein core could be destabilizing to the protein structure.E. coli strain MG1655 was used for cloning of the LC-Cutinase genes into the pACYC vector backbone.Our chosen approach utilized a dialysis membrane with a cut-off of 12-14kDa, which is lower than LC-Cutinase s molecular mass, to enable the diffusion of the PET degradation products outside the bag for utilization by P. putida, while enabling a large concentration of LC-Cutinase inside the bag for efficient degradation of PET.Here are a few examples of mutations present in our mutated variants: A249P - Proline (shown in yellow) is added to increase the rigidity of the protein structure.Based on the structure of LC-Cutinase, we decided to use a rational mutagenesis approach, in which we introduce various mutations to the enzyme s sequence.In order to build a self-sustaining system in which part of the energy from PET could be utilized to make clean energy, we  We chose a bacterium that is proven to be electrochemically active (Timur et al 2007).The mutations were designed using the PROSS (Protein Repair One Stop Shop) algorithm, developed by the Fleishman Lab from the Weizmann Institute (Goldenzweig et al 2016).S257A - Polar side groups, such as a hydroxyl in Serine, with no hydrogen bonds, are destabilizing as the

leader sequence was obtained from the UC-Davis 2012 iGEM team (Part:BBa_K936013) and was amplified using primers containing restriction sites that match the pACYC backbone.Shredded PET was added to the dialysis bag and a magnetic stirrer was used to prevent precipitation.The algorithm uses the following steps in selecting the mutations: A sequence alignment was generated between the target wild-type sequence and other homologous sequences, from which several mutations were chosen.The restriction site had to be unique to avoid digestion of the genes or the vector backbone.Flanking each insert we designed and added homologous sequences to the desired target vector (224 or 434), for cloning with the NEBuilder\u00ae HiFi  DNA Assembly Cloning Kit.The flanking sequences also contained restriction sites for cloning into the multiple cloning site(MCS) of each vector.The mediator\u0092s formal potential should be adequate to the enzyme potential.We decided to use protocatechuic acid as it is part of the terephthalate metabolic pathway, which enables us to reduce the use of external reagents and to create a self-sustaining system.Containing 3 genes from C. testosteroni strain KF-1 for the transport of Terephthalic acid from the periplasmic  The genes involved in the Terephthalate degradation pathway and transporter were acquired from the Darmstadt iGEM team, 2012.Each mutant\u0092s structure was compared to the wild-type structure,  and the energy difference between them was calculated (??Gcalc).Containing 4 genes from the same strain of C. testosteroni for the degradation of Terephthalic acid to Protocatechuic acid \u0096 tphA1, tphA2, tphA3, tphB.At first, we examined the possibility of adding an electron carrier to the fuel cell,  as it was shown to be effective in enhancing the MFCs performance and was demonstrated using this species.We have chosen the pSEVA plasmids because they have been previously used in the P. putida KT2440 strain by the laboratory of Prof. D. Taufik at the Weizmann Institute.", "human_practice": "As an initial step to solve the plastic waste problem, we read the literature, learned what have already been done and met with several experts in different aspects of plastic waste:Prof. Alex Sivan, a scientist from the Ben-Gurion University who is an expert in microbial degradation of plastic waste.After learning about the LC-Cutinase, and making a comprehensive research about its properties we decided to focus on improving its PET degrading activity.Next, we consulted Dr. Sarel Fleishman, a scientist from Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, who is expert in computational protein design to improve enzyme activity.Finally, we aimed to learn about the current solutions for plastic waste.With the acquired knowledge, the magnitude of damage of plastic waste, and it became clear to us that we must find an effective and fast solution to deal with this problem.We also contacted Prof. Dan Tawfik and Dr. Halim Jubran from the Department of Bimolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, who provided the P. Putida KT 2440.In addition we met Prof. Amir Aharoni and Dr. Shimon Bershtein, two scientists from our university who are expert in protein engineering who study and improve complex biological processes.By visiting at Aviv recycling company, we saw and learned the process of plastic recycling \u0096 from the arrival of the plastic bottle to the plant to its reduction into raw plastic material made for the creation of other products.Finally, we discussed our plan and the project s design with our PIs concluding the valuable information to start wet lab work on our project.Furthermore, we done a comprehensive investigation of plastic s implications in order to learn and be able to raise awareness of the plastic hazard.Throughout the project, we met experts from the industry who utilize plastic in its raw state - Coca-Cola Company, Genome compiler and many more.We have learned about plastic s convenient properties such as flexibility, rigidity and lucidity that make plastic a popular raw material in the industry.Discovering that the current recycling process produces plastic waste that is not recyclable was eye opener, as it emphasizes the unmet need for biodegradation of plastic waste.One of the most interesting and important things we have learned is that 99% of the recycled raw plastic material is being used for products that cannot be recycled again.We consulted Prof. Sivan about our approach to a new solution for plastic degradation and learned that LC-Cutinase is an enzyme that is known for his ability to break PET bonds into two monomers: ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "The results show significant raising in the absorption but we didn\u0092t succeed to detect the TPA.The reasons why we

expressing LC-CutinaseCharacterizing E. coli growth inside a dialysis bag Characterization of the co-culturing of E. coli and P. putida - a controlled symbiotic approach Detection of TPA in plates containing PET and E. coli using fluorescence The bacterium Rhodococcus ruber R. ruber, known to utilize polyethylene (PE) as a carbon source, was grown in various liquid growth media with and without amino-acids and containing PE or PET pellets for a period of 30 days.Examining the utilization of PET by E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase In order to test the PET degradation ability of the LC-Cutinase enzyme variants, all variants were grown on M9 minimal medium plates with shredded PET pellets as a sole carbon source to test their ability to degrade PET.As seen from the results, our E. coli was able to grow with only PET as a sole carbon source, suggesting it utilized PET s degradation product, ethylene glycol, as a carbon source.(for detailed instructions on the preparation of the media see Protocols).Figure 28: E. coli expressing the codon-optimized(CO) LC-Cutinase grown on a M9 soft agar plate with shredded PET pellets as a sole carbon source.As seen from the images, the surface of the PET pellets is relatively smooth, there are some high crystallinity rod shaped structures but they are fairly covered.Figure 20: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days

from the image, both samples show growth, corresponding to P. putida s endogenic resistance and E. coli s plasmid acquired resistance to Chloramphenicol.Figure 42: Plate number 2 - samples grown on a

carbon sources for a period of 30 days.As seen in the images above, all LC-Cutinase variants were able to grow on the plates containing shredded PET, suggesting that the PET is degraded and E. coli is utilizing at least one of its products (we assume - ethylene glycol).The media containing plastic as the sole carbon source (PET, PE), reached higher O.D600 values from that of a medium with no carbon source (SM medium) but lower O.D600 than on glucose media or plastic enriched with AA media.Figure 32: E. coli expressing the R7 LC-Cutinase variant grown on a M9 soft agar plate with shredded PET

pellet in a X1000 magnification.Figure 6: A scanning electron microscope image of a PE pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X1000 magnification.For control, TPA presence was detected in plates containing E. coli transformed with an empty vector plasmid (the same vector used for expression of LC-Cutinase), and no bacteria at all.As proof of concept in the biofuel part of our project, Our test results may suggest that there is a potential in constructing a biofuel cell based on the electrochemical activity of P. putida KT 2440 with protocatechuic acid as an electron mediator.If our speculation was correct, the LC-Cutinase was supposed to be expressed from the E. coli, degrade the PET, and the bacterium could consume ethylene glycol from the degradation products.Here are the results of E. coli strain BL21 s growth with liquid M9 media containing ethylene glycol as a sole carbon source:Figure 27: E. coli strain BL21 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of EG for a period of 96 hours.That can be explained by the preferential degradation of the amorphous material exposing the better defined (higher crystallinity) material that goes through a slower degradation (Shah et al 2008).Figure 9: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.Figure 10: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.Figure 11: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.In order to assess the ability of our two chosen bacterial species - E. coli and P. putida to grow in symbiosis, a key element in our project s design, we cultivated both bacteria in a liquid LB medium, separated by a dialysis bag.Even though later tests with R. ruber show that the concentration of enzyme is an important part in efficiency of degradation,  we still decided to run these tests again, with equal enzyme concentrations on our 2 fastest variants - CO and F4:Figure 15: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of 3 LC-Cutinase variants - CO, F4 and the W.T., at a substrate concentration of 125?M.Looking at the entire design- our biofuel cell will consist of E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase that degrades the PET and consumes ethylene glycol (it includes the previous results in the E. coli ethylene glycol utilization results).In contrast, our results show no growth with TPA, which lead us to the conclusion that P. putida cannot utilize it as a sole carbon source.This experiment, although it cannot quantify the degradation efficiency, is another indication of the existence and activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme, and the ability of E. coli expressing our LC-Cutinase to utilize its degradation product- ethylene glycole.However, we have clearly shown that our bacteria can utilize PET as a carbon source using the LC-Cutinase protein, which is a proof-of-concept for one part of our project.Figure 44: PET plates (prepared as previously described in the PET Utilization experiment (Experiments Page), after colony growth, were exposed to UV light (as described in the Terephthalic acid detection assay (Experiments Page)), then tested in a fluorescence gel imager to detect TPA presence by excitation in 314nm end detecting emission at 426nm.We took samples from both PET and PE media (with pellets) and examined them with a Phase-contrast microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM):Figure 3: An image taken with a Phase-contrast microscope from SM media with PET after incubation with R. ruber.We can conclude from these results that our E. coli strain BL21, like other E. coli strains, can utilize EG as a sole carbon source, with an optimal concentration of 30mM.X1000 magnification.Figure 18: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days of incubation in a liquid LB broth with no bacteria.X1000 magnification.Figure 17: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days of incubation in a liquid LB broth with no bacteria.It should be mentioned that protocatechuic acid polymerizes in the presence of amine groups, a reaction that could interfere with the electron transfer, hence other more potent mediators will be explored including the operation of the biofuel cell without mediators, since P. putida are reported to produce their endogenous electron transfer mediators.We have demonstrated that creating a biofilm on a graphite anode can be easily done, making this part of our system applicable.As seen above, after incubation with the LC-Cutinase expressing bacteria, the surface of the PET is rougher than the control.X2500

Colony-PCR results used to the detect the presence of the aldA gene(1440bp) from E. coli shown on 1% agarose gel.Samples were left to incubate unopened for 3 months to test for the formation of biofilms.Figure 2: R. ruber biofilm formation on a PE pellet.In this experiment we grew E. coli strain BL-21 transformed with the pACYC vector containing the LC-Cutinase W.T.We have witnessed similar results with PET pellets, suggesting R. ruber can also utilize PET as a sole carbon source.As shown, plates containing E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase showed higher emission levels, which indicates of higher presence of TPA in the plates in question.Moreover, we see that E. coli remained viable throughout the experiment, verifying our hypothesis that it can grow inside a dialysis bag, and suggesting that our symbiotic design using a dialysis bag is plausible.We consider that result as an important step and a proof-of-concept of our final goal.gene grown in liquid M9 media with PET as a sole carbon source.Moreover, when comparing the bacteria expressing the LC-Cutinase gene and the bacteria transformed with an empty vector backbone, we see a clear difference in the texture of the PET.One method to assess the activity of our designed mutants was using the pNP-butyrate (pNP-B) degradation assay We ran the tests on all 5 variants of the LC-Cutinase protein with different concentrations of the substrate: Figure 12: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.It is important to note, that to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PET degradation by R. ruber is reported.We assume that this is the result of the PET degradation activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme.Those results are a consequence of a rupture in the dialysis membrane which occurred during the experiment.Reviewing these results leads us to the conclusion that the TPA degradation pathway must be cloned into the P. putida bacterium for efficient PET degradation.In order to test P. putida s ability to utilize TPA and PCA as a carbon source we measured O.D610 values for a period of ~100 hours with P. putida in liquid M9 media with either TPA or PCA as a carbon source.As seen from these results, all of our variants, including the codon-optimized Cutinase, have shown increased pNP-B degradation activity compared to the W.T.From these results we conclude that P. putida can utilize PCA as a sole carbon source, as previously reported.As seen from the results above, both bacteria maintained viability using our dialysis bag apparatus during the experiment.Samples taken from plates 1,3,6,7 and 10 were positive, suggesting they contained E. coli.Figure 41: Plate number 1 - samples taken from inside and outside the dialysis bag and grown over-night on a petri dish containing Chloramphenicol.As seen from the image, both samples show growth, suggesting that both samples contain P. putida, which has endogenic resistance to Ampicillin.It should be mentioned that it is not yet established that R. ruber is able to utilize PET as a carbon source.We have managed to show that out E. coli will be able to break down PET in conditions similar to those in our designed biofuel cell and to survive without any other carbon source.Controls are the same as with 50?M concentration.Figure 14: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.Contrary to our expectations, the untreated PET surface is smooth while the treated sample\u0092s surface seemed to have gone through degradation (fig.In the second day of measurements, there was a decline in power output probably due to cell death.As seen from the results, the Km values of our variants compared to the W.T.To prevent contamination, we used Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol (at 100?g/mL and 34.1?g/mL respectively) as selection markers.Figure 25: P. putida KT2440 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of PCA for a period of 96 hours.Please note, that when comparing the appearance of degraded PET between LC-Cutinase degraded PET and R. ruber degraded PET, they looked the  same, however, the difference was that it took a month to R. ruber to degrade PET to the observed picture (Fig.Moreover, our new LC-Cutinase genes consist of a PelB leader sequence that has been codon optimized to maximize expression levels in E. coli.5 and 10mM concentration were tested twice (\"a/b\").Figure 26: P. putida KT2440 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of TCA for a period of 136 hours.LC-Cutinase grown on a M9 agar plate no carbon source.Detection of TPA in plates containing PET and E. coli using fluorescenceAfter seeing bacterial growth on our PET plates, we wanted to combine our protocols of PET utilization and to detect the presence of TPA in our plates.Again, we can see that the CO and F4 variants have higher activity in regards to pNP-B degradation than the W.T.Figure 39: Colony-PCR results used to the detect the presence of the pcaD gene(792bp) from P. putida shown on 1% agarose gel.As part of our work with the P. putida KT2440 strain we wanted to test its antibiotic resistances, so we can select the appropriate cloning vectors.We cannot conclude which variant degrades the PET with the highest efficiency, as the PET in the plates is not evenly spread and the amount of PET degraded cannot be measured in this assay.Calculating the values from the CV measurements we found that the substance had a middle point Potential of E0 = 174 mV vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.Figure 43: Plate number 4 - samples taken from inside and outside the dialysis bag and grown over-night on a petri dish containing Kanamycin.For control we used E. coli strain BL-21 without any vector (\"BL-21\") with pACYC plasmid backbone only (\"pACYC\").Figure 13: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.That being said, more experiments are required in order to confirm our hypothesis and determine the proper concentrations of the protocatechuic acid and characterize the mechanisms with which it mediates P. putida s electron transfer.We also notice that the surface of the PET looks more porous and the rod shaped, high crystallinity PET, is more exposed than in the control.Which is an indication to the electroactivity of P. putida compared to control, with relatively high internal resistance.We can see a large increase in power output induced in the sample containing bacteria in the 250-500 mV range,  compared to the control.The internal resistance was measured in the first day with values of 60 ? for the cell containing bacteria and 1000 ? for the control.One control was PET pellets incubated for 2 days in LB liquid media with no bacteria.We speculated that in this case the EPS is used for the absorption of the PET micro particles and allows the accumulation of secreted enzymes.Moreover, when comparing the Kcat values of our variant to the W.T.Finally, we can see that the catalytic efficiency, portrayed by the Kcat/Km value, has been significantly improved in our variants, compared to the W.T.As seen from the image, no growth is visible in either sample.It can be explained by the ability of bacteria, i.e.", "safety": "\"Synthetic biology is a relatively new science with tremendous potential to change how we view and

regarding scientific research and progress.We thought that as we modify organisms in our lab enabling them to preform new functions,  we should learn our limitations and the complexities are involved in synthetic biology.(For example, at times, it was necessary to work with a chemical like Catechol, or to handle EthidiumSafe Project Design (Safety Risks to the General Public): Our final goal as

paper, \"Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View\u0094, Prof. Glick describes the Jewish approach towards scientific progress as well rounded and aware to the problems it presents: \"Judaism traditionally looks favorably on man as a co-creator with God and encourages research for the benefit of humankind.All of our project s lab members received safety training by our advisors, and had to partake in a lab safety online  course offered by the Ben Gurion University safety department.In order to ensure the safety of our product, we integrated into our design the self-destruct mechanism developed by the 2013 Ben Gurion University iGEM team.During the summer, we met several experts from the bioethics field, who gave us general new ethical insights that might be First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science.Thus, we learned that ethical issues need to be considered in many  Second, we learned that our designed product is encountered with a relativity new term called genetically modified organism  (GMO).In recent years, effective biosafety laws and regulations have been adapted by several countries to prevent terrorists and  other hostile powers from obtaining dangerous biological agents, technologies, or information that would allow them to  In 2008, the Israeli parliament (\"Kenesset\") decided to tighten biosecurity measures and legislated the regulation of  research into biological disease agents law, which provides a legislative framework to conduct research involved biological  disease agents.Furthermore, ethic  issues might arise during the research process.These principals are much alike some aspects  Familiarizing with the GMO concept, we discovered that there is a discrepancy between the way the public perceive bioethics and the way it is studied and practiced.But, in the Jewish tradition man is also charged with stewardship over nature and  is admonished to preserve and nurture, not just to exploit and destroy\".With this mechanism, not only the expression of our genes will be dependent on an IPTG inducer, but it will also force our E. coli to be fully dependent on an unnatural amino acid (UAA).In our project, we preformed multiple growth experiments using different intermediates in the PET degradation  pathway as carbon sources.Some of the chemicals have specific safety instructions according to their MSDS,  which were printed out and stored in the lab for all of the members to read and work according to.Synthetic biology promises significant advances in areas such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, agriculture, and medicine  Many concerns might stem from the field of synthetic biology.For instance, researchers confronts ethical questions regarding integrity, objectivity and authenticity during the research process.In the lab, we wear protective clothing and gloves at all times (unless working with fire).World-wide governments, including the federal regime in the USA, had a minor role in regulating and enforcing ethical  As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues.Many hold the view that  pollution is an insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care  for God s creation.Without supplying it to the bacteria medium, or in case of release to the environment (which will only happen by accident since we do not intend to release our bacteria), our E. coli bacteria will not survive.The Talmud which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, teaches  a basic ethical principle in Jewish law, the  Bal Tashchit  (\"do not destroy\") commend.Does a genetically modified organism can have a negatively effects on the environment or on human being?We found a quote from Rabi Moshe Ben Maimon (Maimonidas), a philosopher, scientist, polymath and one of the  most important adjudicators in the Jewish religion that lived in the Middle Ages :\"If men possessed wisdom, which stands  in the same relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye, they would not cause any injury to themselves or to others, for the knowledge of the truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual injuries\".The federal government in the USA and the European governments enforce all aspects regarding the research process, implementing rules and regulations.Third, we asked ourselves what is the potentially harmful consequences that may emerge when implementing new technology.We met with Prof. Shimon Glick from the  Faculty of Health Sciences (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be er-Sheva, Israel), an expert in the field of Jewish medical ethics.The law calls for the establishment of a council to regulate and monitor research on select infectious  disease agents.The federal government As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues.Our second bacterium, P. putida, which is design to consume TPA (one of the PET degradation products), would not be able to consume PET as it is dependent on LC-Cutinase (the enzyme which breaks the initial bond in the PET polymer into TPA and EG), since LC-Cutinase is expressed and secreted from E. coli.Such concerns  are also considered a biosafety matter as creating a GMO is accompanied with lots of uncertainties regarding its future effects on the environment.It also prescribes institutional committees with defined responsibilities and identifies means of control, Until the beginning of the 50 s there were no clear guide lines or standards for ethical behavior in conducting a research.Furthermore, GMOs is widely  We also learned that there are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, when a marked difference can be  found between the United states that favor for GMO products while Europe union is basically against.For example: Bacterium self - destruction switch mechanism that was developed by BGU iGEM Team 2013,  And allows to control the life time of the modified organism.Thus, the Jewish tradition would haves a positive attitude towards the current goals of synthetic biology.In the meeting Prof. Glick thought us about Jewish views of bioethics.In order to  enforce these regulations, government instructed the establishment of the Institutional Review Board (IRB).The lack of knowledge and the complexity of this field arise many  questions and concerns among the general public.(Prof. Bracha Rager-Zisman, Department of Microbiology  Immunology and Genetics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) .This way, the degradation process does not release any pollutants or toxins to the environment other than the  carbon dioxide and water bacteria produce in their own metabolic processes.The commend orders men not to waste or destroy our earth, the commend is invoked only for destruction that is deemed unnecessary.The Book of Genesis indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis emphasizes that

this is due to the difference in their degradation rates; while sok has a half life of 30 seconds, the half life of hok is much higher: of 30 minutes.Both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don\u0092t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.Additionally, both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don\u0092t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.In order for it not to be produced in higher concentrations than necessary, which can lead to the risk of it not being completely inhibited by sok, we have inserted only one hok sequence in this design.While the cells contain the DNA circuit and are inside the bioreactor, they will produce both the toxin and antitoxin, and will live.Therefore, the developed bacteria wouldn\u0092t be producing neither Lcp nor roxA, presenting no threats to usable rubber or to the environment.Although the simplified Hok-Sok kill switch mechanism proposed by our team allows, with low energy cost, the efficient and rapid death of the cells after leaving the bioreactor, it doesn\u0092t grant that cells inside the bioreactor which didn\u0092t inherit the developed DNA circuit die.As we use inducible promoters for producing the rubber degrading enzymes, if rhamnose isn\u0092t present on the environment, our genic circuit is off - presenting no threats.None of the used DNA parts in the main circuit has any direct relation with virulence and the organism presents low pathogenicity, besides being a commonly found bacteria.Besides the plasmid having an antibiotic resistance related part- on our first project design -, it is a known and common sequence, which can be easily obtained by DNA synthesis or acquiring the plasmid commercially, for example.If the bacteria is released from the bioreactor, it will be in an environment without rhamnose, and won t produce tetR - leading to the production of HokD, a protein that causes cell membrane depolarization, killing the microorganism.As the bacteria desired to survive will contain a plasmid with antibiotic resistance, it won\u0092t die - and all of the other bacteria will.This may be a problem to the process efficiency, as cells that aren\u0092t developing the desired processes will be competing for nutrients with the ones that contain the DNA circuit.A kill switch mechanism designed to be activated when the bacteria leaves the bioreactor was included in our DNA circuit.Brasil-USP team is very concerned about the project\u0092s biosafety, and considered it not only while working in the wet lab but also while designing our biological system.These acts as a physical containment for the developed bacteria and, therefore, minimize the risks of releasing it unexpectedly to the environment.Also, as these processes are being idealized to be performed in factories, only few people of the staff would have contact with the developed microorganism; and these would be specifically trained to minimize contamination - granting an even lower chance of the microorganism being released unexpectedly.The main molecule produced in this process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al), however there are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, it will be produced constantly while the cell is inside the bioreactor.The hok system promoter is changed to a constitutive one - so it will also be produced constantly.All the procedures applied in our team\u0092s project have been discussed with the members and no safety concerns were raised.Conditional suicide system for the containment of bacteria and plasmids.Our circuit uses inducible promoters (BBa_K91403; BBa_R0080; BBa_R0010), so if the trigger reactant isn\u0092t present our genic circuit is off, not producing the ODTD molecule, which might be toxic to the environment.This is how it works: the bacterial culture medium will contain rhamnose, activating the left part of our designed DNA circuit (Figure 1).In order to eliminate this issue, our team proposed inserting our circuit and the antibiotic resistance into the genome of the developed bacteria - avoiding horizontal gene transfer and the creation of potentially dangerous organisms.Therefore, no relevant risks to the environment were detected.On our first project design, however, we still depend on antibiotic resistance for maintenance of the desired plasmid.There are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, this strain is classificated in Risk group 1, and it meets the requirements of the US NIH.As the continuum use of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria and has been avoided by scientific community5, our team proposes a circuit that would be able to control these problems.The main molecule produced in this process is the 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD).Additionally, the E. coli BL21, contains several mutations silenced, and does not compete in the environment.It will not be constructed due to time issues, but it is idealized here (Figure 2).The circuits includes sok, a RNA antitoxin, under the rhamnose promoter; tetR is removed from the circuit.We are using a strain of E. coli that it s not supposed to survive greatly in the environment.In order to minimize the release of the developed bacteria to the environment, we were very careful in the disposal of biological material at the laboratory.For the proposed project, these contaminations will be controlled using antibiotics.All of the students involved in our project have received safety instructions for working at the laboratory.According to the DSMZ database, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are from the risk group 1, and does not offer any disease on healthy adult humans.For the Interlab study, we used E. Coli DH5-?.Unfortunately, physical containment alone isn\u0092t enough to ensure that the GMO\u0092s won\u0092t be released accidentally.If the kill switch fails, the bacteria will only survive in extreme conditions, which was a low probability to occur.O.

Coli without plasmid), confirmed by a Mann-Whitney U test.However, it is known that TatA is the most expressed gene of this pathway and it has 60% of homology with TatE, which can partially substitute TatA; TaTB can form a complex with TatC to prevent its degradation; there is evidence that TatC is the signal peptide binding protein and, finally, TatD produces no effect on protein translocation but has DNase activity.5 The secretion is composed by 12-16 different proteins, but none of these proteins have their specific roles elucidated.5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ompA mechanism is inserted in the type I secretion system which, in Gram negative bacteria, promotes the secretion of various proteins of different sizes and functions in one single step, without the necessity of a periplasmic intermediate.The proposed circuit provides the secretion of the proteins by the fusion with a specific signal sequence, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence, or its binding to the bacterial outer membrane by the fusion with a specific protein, OmpA fused with a linker (BBa_K1489002).We show in figures 2 and 3 our results.Figure 2 - Optical Density (OD) measurements over time, showing that all colonies were in their log phase.Figure 3 - Fluorescence per cell for each promoter, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.The first one aims to get the protein through the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and, for that, it can use three different pathways (the SecB-dependent pathway, the signal recognition particle (SRP), and the twin-arginine translocation (TAT)).Our results are in figure 4 and 5.Figure 4 - Fluorescence per cell for pLac, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.Unfortunately we weren\u0092t able to perform these tests, first due to our problems with promoter test and second because we are still in the circuit construction phase.We see that with IPTG, GFP activity incresases and RFP activity decreases, as it should happen.Figure 5 - Fluorescence per cell for each promoter, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.The second step is the protein translocation through the outer membrane, involving specific protein machinery known as the secreton.5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The TAT pathway, unlike the SecB or the SRP pathways, is capable of transporting folded proteins across the inner membrane independently of ATP using the transmembrane PMF (proton-motive force).5 This translocation system is composed mainly of five proteins (TatA, TatB, TatC, TatD and TatE) but their specific function have not been firmly established yet.Therefor we planned circuits with two exportation systems, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence and the fusion of the enzymes with the bacterial outer membrane, OmpA, to check which of these exportation systems were better for each of the enzymes.Not only the induced activity is lower than the activity without induction - for the first 3 concentrations of Rhamnose -, but also the RFP is also growing.BBa_K1819008 was submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts as a Brasil-USP team new part.Moreover, there are several large scale system established for E. coli use in industry and, since our project aim for industrial applications, we have chosen the E. coli system allied with the previously named secretion routes that might help increase enzymes  stability.Another possibility for our negative results is the wrong ligations between the parts, that again we just confirmed by agarose gel instead of sequencing.Figure 6 - Exportation test circuits (more information about the design of the circuits here).The protein being transported has a specific C-terminal signal sequence that usually has few to 50 glycine rich-repeats, that might be necessary for the protein function and, therefore, is not cleaved during the secretion6.These enzymes are fundamental for rubber degradation and have to be secreted or exposed in the exterior of the cell to be in direct contact with their substrate, the poly(cis-1,4 isoprene) - the main component of rubber.The exportation of RoxA ensures its passage through the bacterial periplasm which increases the chances of a correct folding of the protein.The designed circuits are shown in the figure below (Figure 6).The Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) system is classified as part of the type II bacterial secretion mechanism, which is composed of two steps.Figure 1 - Promoter test circuits (more information about the design of the circuits here).We intended to evaluate the exportations systems through GFP fluorescence, since this phenomenon depends on the correct folding of the protein, which in this case is linked with the folding of Lcp and RoxA.strain 35Y.1 However, most of these organisms show a slow growth when using rubber as a sole carbon source.2-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To improve microbial rubber degradation efficiency, our project aims to create a gene circuit which will, among other things, be responsible for coding and expressing two enzymes: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase A) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein).TAs mentioned earlier, our enzymes have to be secreted so they can be in contact with the substrate, moreover it\u0092s been seen that the heterologous expression of RoxA wasn\u0092t successful due to inclusion body formation.The secretion is driven by three proteins of the cell envelope6.The first one is located in the outer membrane, and is called OMP (Outer Membrane Protein); the other two are cytoplasmic membrane proteins, called ABC (ATP-Binding Cassette) and MFP (Membrane Fusion Protein).However, the choice of the promoter system is not as simple as the chassis .The Gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli is the most used chassis in Synthetic Biology.This signal sequence recognizes the ABC protein and triggers the assembly of the whole complex for the translocation process.Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed induction, i.e., induced fluorescence per cell was (statistically) significantly higher than our negative controls.Since we had no issues at all with any of our constitutive promoters (see for instance our Interlab Study, Pveg characterization in E. Coli, Linker-GFP part), our primary concern is that our protocols should be modified and optimized for induced promoters.Finally, no considerable changes were detected in the RFP measures.In the x-axis, the higher the concentration label, the higher the concentration, with zero means no induction at all.That being said, we designed circuits to test the viability of three different inducible promoters: Plac, Para and Prha (figure 1).", "safety": "If they leave the bioreactor, sok won\u0092t be produced, and the cell will die due to hok presence.For cells that didn\u0092t inherited the developed DNA circuit: these will contain Hok in their plasma, but not sok - this is due to the difference in their degradation rates;

BBa_R0080; BBa_R0010), so if the trigger reactant isn\u0092t present our genic circuit is off, not producing the ODTD molecule, which might be toxic to the environment.This is how it works: the bacterial culture medium will contain rhamnose, activating the left part of our designed DNA circuit (Figure 1).In order to eliminate this issue, our team proposed inserting our circuit and the antibiotic resistance into the genome of the developed bacteria - avoiding horizontal gene transfer and the creation of potentially dangerous organisms.Therefore, no relevant risks to the environment were detected.On our first project design, however, we still depend on antibiotic resistance for maintenance of the desired plasmid.There are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, this strain is classificated in Risk group 1, and it meets the requirements of the US NIH.As the continuum use of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria and has been avoided by scientific community5, our team proposes a circuit that would be able to control these problems.The main molecule produced in this process is the 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD).Additionally, the E. coli BL21, contains several mutations silenced, and does not compete in the environment.It will not be constructed due to time issues, but it is idealized here (Figure 2).The circuits includes sok, a RNA antitoxin, under the rhamnose promoter; tetR is removed from the circuit.We are using a strain of E. coli that it s not supposed to survive greatly in the environment.In order to minimize the release of the developed bacteria to the environment, we were very careful in the disposal of biological material at the laboratory.For the proposed project, these contaminations will be controlled using antibiotics.All of the students involved in our project have received safety instructions for working at the laboratory.According to the DSMZ database, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are from the risk group 1, and does not offer any disease on healthy adult humans.For the Interlab study, we used E. Coli DH5-?.Unfortunately, physical containment alone isn\u0092t enough to ensure that the GMO\u0092s won\u0092t be released accidentally.If the kill switch fails, the bacteria will only survive in extreme conditions, which was a low probability to occur.O. R. Faridani, A. Nikravesh, D. P. Pandey, L. Good, K. Gerdes Escherichia coli in the Environment: Implications for Water Quality and Human Health.All of the knowledge obtained in the course was applied on the project developed for iGEM.Graduated students have attended a course offered by S\u00e3o Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC/USP) about basic safety aspects, and then instructed undergraduate students about the precautions to be taken.The course included topics such as: the use of appropriated clothing and personal protective equipment; correct use of equipments such as autoclave, laminar hood flow, electrophoresis chamber and centrifuge; handling safety aspects and disposal of biological and chemical agents; specific danger of the main reagents used at the lab; and precautions about bioaerosol.The mechanism is expected to kill the cells almost immediately, with only a fraction of 1.4 x 10-4 the cells surviving after 90 minutes4.Therefore, the system is efficient for containing the microorganism spreading and its modified DNA

linker.In the experiment, we hypothesized that an elongated linker would enhance the function of the fusion protein for the original linker is too short for the proper folding of the two domains.However, we found no result in the previous history using this linker.So we went to the linker library in iGEM part registry website to search for a longer linker.Through the reference searching, we found that the previous research all used the three-alanine linker.(see Design & Device)This year, we have designed fusion proteins of spider toxin in conjunction with snowdrop lectin by the three-alanine linker.In the experiment(See the Link), the fusion protein with the elongated GS linker did show the enhanced repellent effect.Therefore, we modified the sequence and added three more amino acids into the linker in case it was still too short for proper protein folding.Observed from the phenomenon, we did prove the enhanced function of the fusion proteins, so we speculate that the fusion protein has a better secondary structure than the original ones.It is a revolutionary system that not only guarantees the safety of the farmers and customers worldwide but also safeguards the sustainability of the environment and ecosystem.", "design": "2001, 276, 40306\u009640312Elaine Fitches, Martin G.

[5]In nature, spiders inject venom into the haemolymph of insects\u0092 that causes the death of the prey.AnachnoServer is an online database that contains nearly 800 peptide toxin information from 78 spider species[1], and UniProt is a library of protein information.Also, snowdrop lectin is proved to be resistant to proteolytic activity in the insect gut.Another apprehension about nowadays insecticidal pesticide is that through bioaccumulation, the pesticide chemical residue will accumulate in the human body, and can\u0092t be degraded by us.The traditional pesticide will kill all the insects in the farmland no matter it is pest or not.The inspiration for Pantide originates from the food chain.The active site in the peptide that performs its toxicity are the amino acids located in loop regions.[6] Snowdrop Lectin recognizes the glycoproteins on the epithelial cell in the insect gut and facilitates the fusion protein to cross the epithelial cell by transcytosis.To tackle this problem, Pantide is species specific to several orders of pests, Hv1a targets Lepidopteran, Orthopteran, and Dipteran, Sf1a targets Lepidopteran, and Dipteran, OAIP targets Lepidopteran and Coleopteran.The devices in each area will collect the farmland conditions respectively, and the data will be transmitted to one host device in each area through Bluetooth, and then the host will upload the data of its area up to the cloud through WiFi.By using these three peptides alternately, the pest is hard to have resistance.For the practical application in the farmland, the farm will be divided into several areas, in each area, several sets of devices and sensors will be installed.Take Hv1a as an example for proving the stability of ICK; Hv1a is highly stable in the temperature range of -20\u00b0C to 75\u00b0C and pH values of 1 to 8.Sf1a is a toxic peptide derived from Segestria florentina (Tube-web spider).In this case, we chose snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) lectin as a carrier of toxin peptides to create a fusion protein.Spiders are one of the most successful terrestrial venomous creatures on earth.Hv1a is lethal to several insect orders but is not toxic to mice.; Christie, M.J.; King, G.F. \u0093Discovery and structure of a potent and highly specific blocker of insect calcium channels,\u0094 J.

protein works performs its toxicity better.In the two-hour test, we can see that most of the tobacco cutworms move to eat the negative control group, which proves the repellent effect of Pantide.After the three experiments, we have three conclusions.Pantide performs its toxicity as a repellent in vivo.The remained leaves area decreased as the concentration of PANTIDE decreased, which shows the dose response of Pantide.In comparison with the two other design, we could find out that the remained leaves area with improved Hv1a-lectin were all more than that of the original Hv1a-lectin and Hv1a.(a)

in an easy way, the testee selection, and experiment design would be briefly described.(Table 1)After amplification with PCR, the PCE products of Hv1a, Sf1a, and OAIP have a length of around 500bp? and Hv1a-Lectin, Sf1a-Lectin, and OAIP-Lectin has a length of 750bp~1000bp? and Hv1a-Lectin with GS linker has a length of 893bp.It shows in figure5.To use the p-value as an indicator of statistical significance, we compared Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin with the negative control; it shows that the remained leaf disk area of Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin are significantly different from negative control, shown in figure6.To sum up, the Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin work well in vivo.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification analysis of electrophoresis of seven PCR products with Marker labeled length on the left

have a length of 17kDa~19kDa.The T-test analysis in different dose of GS-linker improvement test.To know how the length of the linker affect the function of the fusion protein, we constructed Hv1a-lectin with the original three-alanine linker and a longer GS linker.The T-test analysis in different dose of OAIP/OAIP-lectin.In this experiment, we compared the toxicity effect of the three toxin designs including Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin/Hv1a-lectin with GS linker to test the toxicity effect.To know the qualitative toxicity effect of Pantide, we prepared the samples with the sonicated LB solution lysate containing Pantide-expressed E. coli Rosetta-Gami strain and diluted it with the three concentration.SDS-PAGE result of the seven purified Pantide products compared with the unpurified one, and with Marker labeled length on the left hand.In the following experiments, we used E. coli BL21 Rosetta-Gami strain to produce Pantide.The T-test analysis in different dose of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin.Figure4 shows the pictures of the remained leaf disks after twelve hours of feeding assays.The tobacco cutworms have a preference on the leave disks without applying Pantide.Although Pantide does not act as a biological pesticide as our hypothesis had mentioned, we may conclude that it is a biological insect repellent, which corresponds to our ideology of lowering the artificial impacts on the environment and simultaneously achieve effective pest control.Remained leaves in the GS-linker improvement test with the Hv1a, Hv1a-lectin, and Hv1a-lectin GS-linker improved.Figure14.All the experiments were to check the functions of Pantide for leaf protection, so the observation of the results would focus on the remained area of the leaf disks.The dose response is shown in figure5.Compared Hv1a with Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area in the Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a, which means the repellent efficiency of Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a.Figure11 shows the ratio of the remained area on the leaf disks.Figure5 shows the percentage of the remained area on the leaf disks.After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratios, we measured the area with the software imageJ.After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratio, we measured the area with the software

further purified Pantide to check whether it is well-expressed.The effect can be roughly ranked as:Hv1a-lectin > Hv1a > E. coli > Negative controlWe got the similar result in the Sf1a/Sf1a-lectin and OAIP/OAIP-lectin.Figure7.The p-value of the T-test can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other.In the test of Pantide toxicity, we chose tobacco cutworm as the testee for the insect appetite tests because all the Pantide targets lepidopterans.Remained leaf disks in the pre-test with the OAIP and OAIP-lectin.Figure11.Remained leaf disks in the pre-test with the Sf1a and Sf1a-lectin.Figure8.The observed phenomenon can be analyzed below.With the dilution of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area decreased, which indicates the dose response.SDS-PAGE result of the six Pantide-expressed sonicated products compared with the unexpressed sonicated one as a control and with Marker labeled length on the left hand.Afterward, we sonicated E. coli and then ran SDS-PAGE to make sure that Pantide fell into the correct ranges.The positive control in the experiment was to apply Bacillus thuringiensis on the leaf disks, which is nowadays the most widely-used bioinsecticide, and the negative control group in the test was DD water.This experiment is the pre-test that shows us whether the amount of Pantide is sufficient enough to perform the toxicity against the larvae.(Table 2)The gel of SDS-PAGE result is correct, and here is our result.Besides, there is also a Hv1a without the linker between the repellent peptide and the lectin served as a comparative sample.In the picture, it shows as a star.We hope that we can observe the difference of the three toxins in vivo.We applied the sample onto the leaf disks and put five cutworms into the separate cabinets for feeding assays.We preserved all the result of the remained leaves sealing with the glass paper and calculated the percentage of the remained area on the leaves.The results consist of three parts-feeding assay pre-test, the fusion protein improvement test, and preference test.The mechanism of the repellent effect is so far unknown.The toxicity efficacy of Pantide is equal to Bacillus thuringiensis.According to the mechanism of Pantide, Pantide is supposed to perform its toxicity in the nervous system of the larvae.(Figure 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g) As a result, the constructions of BioBrick were correct.Figure 3.With the elongation of the linker, the improved fusion protein has the best repellent effect.**Note: The word \u0093Pantide\u0094 in the following paragraph refers to the collection of all the toxin design in our project.Figure6 shows the p-value with the star attached to indicate P < 0.05 and two stars to indicate P < 0.01.B is the elution product of purification.", "safety": "To ensure that Pantide will degrade into amino acids when it is released into the environment, we have done an experiment to prove that Pantide does degrade in the ultraviolet light.Therefore, we should guarantee that Pantide is safe to humans and harmless to the environment.So, after we expressed Pantide with E. coli, the LB broth containing E.coli should be first sonicated by the sonicator to let Pantide be soluble in the LB broth.(See the experiment) Once we have known that Pantide will degrade in the ultraviolet light, we may conclude that Pantide will degrade in the natural light over time.One is the laboratory safety; the other is the safety of spraying Pantide into the environment.Before entering the laboratory, all the members in NCTU_Formosa must receive several training courses and evaluate exams offered by Environmental Protection and Safety Center.So it is harmless for the environment.With the degradation modeling simulation (See the Modelling), we may also apply the degradation rate into the automatic spraying device.For humans, Pantide will not have any negative effect on human health.As a result, we design a processing standard in the laboratory.When the customer gets the agricultural produce from the market, most of the Pantide is thought to have degraded into amino acids and even there is some residue of Pantide on the surface of the product.When it is washed into the soil or in water resources, Pantide is ineffective to the microbiomes and the vertebrate in the ecosystem.The content of the training courses consists of four parts.For the basic laboratory safety instruction, we learned the safety level of laboratories and personal protective equipment.For the laboratory emergency response, we learned of how to react to several emergency situations and certain procedure dealing with specific chemicals.For the toxic chemical operation and management, we learned the content of the material safety data sheet (MSDS).For biosafety, we learned biological hazard, including levels of biohazard and instructions of dealing with biological trash.The four training courses contain an evaluating exam.Instead, it can be as the fertilizer.The product we spray into the environment should not contain any genetically-modified organisms.SDS-PAGE gel and the concentrations of boiling test to native Hv1a-lectin (17.1 kDa).After taking the courses and passing the exam, we all get certificates for each training.In the future, we plan to spray Pantide onto the environment.", "keywords":

"Thus, the mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase that we design will be able to enzymatically distinguish the wild-type leucine from the protected leucine.Through research and experimentation, we determined that N-carbobenzyloxy-leucine (CBZ-leucine) fulfilled our criteria, and was also commercially available.The cleavage enzyme will remove the CBZ group from the CBZ-leucyl-tRNA, allowing for normal leucine to be incorporated normally into polypeptides.To accomplish this goal, we aimed to select a protecting group for leucine and a corresponding cleavage enzyme to remove the protecting group, and to replace the wild-type leucyl-tRNA synthetase with a mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase of our design.The biocontainment functionality of this system begins at metabolite uptake.In this way, the cell is incorporating normal leucine amino acids into proteins, while still being reliant on protected leucine.Our protecting group needs to bind to the N-terminus of leucine, as the C-terminus of the amino acid has to bind to tRNA.The amino-acyl-tRNA bond formation active site should be sterically altered to select for CBZ-leucine, and the editing site should also be changed so that it recognizes wild-type-leucyl-tRNA as an incorrect pairing.To implement this system completely, the genes for both the CBZ cleavage enzyme and for the mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase need to be readily transcribed and translated into functional proteins in the organism.Additionally, to ensure that leucine is not usable in the organism s metabolism, the wild-type leucyl-tRNA synthetase gene needs to be knocked out.Once its protecting group is removed, the wild-type leucyl-tRNA can continue on to polypeptide formation.The non-natural modified leucine, after uptake, would then be charged with tRNA molecule to become a modified-leucine-tRNA molecule via a synthetase enzyme.In this way, we would guarantee that the organism cannot survive without supplementation of the CBZ leucine.In our project, we aim to replace the leucyl-tRNA synthetase with a mutated version that will charge tRNA with CBZ-leucine instead of wild-type leucine.The mutant synthetase has two requirements: it should preferentially bind CBZ-leucine with tRNA, and also hydrolyze any wild-type leucine-tRNA that forms.The mutant has two active sites, one which creates the amino acyl-tRNA bond, and one which edits these amino-acyl-tRNA bonds.tRNA synthetase enzymes serve an essential step in the polypeptide formation pathway: they join amino acids and tRNA molecules to form aminoacyl-tRNAs, which go on to the ribosome to form polypeptides.We set out to create a device that would confer biocontainment on the translational level by modifying the cell to need a modified metabolite for survival.The cell must be able to take up a non-natural metabolite that is not typically readily available in the environment.Without the necessary metabolite needed to fuel our modified system, the cell is prevented from continuing translation.However, this step requires a modified synthetase so that the modified leucine, rather than wild-type leucine, is preferentially charged with tRNA.We needed to select an essential

"human_practice": "Working with the head of the Open Bio Labs, we created a biosafety guidelines document, including provisions on biocontainment.Not only did we work to improve awareness of and dialogue about biocontainment in the general public, but we also considered the iGEM community as another target audience.In response to these discussions, our team generated a sample policy proposal for the testing, application, monitoring, and termination of biocontainment devices in a released GEO.In the development of our method, we conducted interviews not only with synthetic biology experts, but also with individuals working in various industries that use microbes or genetically engineered organisms (GEOs).Feedback on our proposed biocontainment method from synthetic biology experts allowed us to reassess our project design, our definition of success, and how we would demonstrate that success.The results of this survey and our conversations with scientific and ethical experts informed the creation of a biocontainment pamphlet for the use of future iGEM teams.Despite the rapid growth of the field, several applications face barriers to implementation, including the lack of an effective, cheap, and easy-to-use biocontainment method.In addition to educating other teams about biocontainment, these conversations allowed us to gauge the current knowledge and concerns of the iGEM community.With industry experts, we discussed the potential for application of our biocontainment method in their companies or industries.As the field of synthetic biology moves out of its infancy, molecular biologists, community biology laboratories, and iGEM teams around the globe are making revolutionary discoveries with more frequency and greater impact.In July, our team facilitated a forum discussion about biocontainment at the University of Maryland\u0092s Mini-Jamboree event.At this event, we designed our own module and accompanying video to teach children and their parents about the purpose of biocontainment.We also created a widget that teams can utilize to determine the best biocontainment method for their project, depending on their specific concerns and implementation goals.To further improve public awareness on synthetic biology and biocontainment, we created two videos on these topics.Oftentimes, individuals working in relevant industries were very knowledgeable about the biological concerns raised by our methods and offered insight on the design or testing of our method.Additionally, we spoke to the main regulatory agencies of GEOs in the US about their current policies.However, while speaking to these experts, it was clear that lack of an acceptable biocontainment method was not the only barrier preventing implementation.", "modeling": "The following is a visualization of our mutant synthetase with optimal structure.Upon initiation, MUT asks for four main inputs: the protein pdb file that will be analysed, the residues that the program will mutate, the coordinates of the binding pocket for docking simulations, and a ligand pdb file.To perform mutagenesis on leucyl-tRNA synthetase, an integrated software script was written in the Linux shell, with inputs including a protein to mutate, a ligand, a list of residues of interest, and binding pocket location.Using a variety of protein-ligand docking software like CSM-lig, Autodock Vina and iGEMDOCK, we were able to confirm that AMS (the adenylating agent found in the literature) and AMP yield similar binding affinities to the synthetase when bound with leucine.Lastly, we performed Michaelis-Menten modeling for the enzyme pepsin to gauge activity in nonspecific cleavage enzymes.The leucine tRNA Synthetase (LeuS) used in the following simulations was found using the RCSB Protein Data Bank.After mutagenesis is complete files undergo stability testing and docking to determine if the new mutant is stable and a better match for the ligand.To select a protecting group, the team used protein-ligand docking software to compare binding affinities of several protected leucine/synthetase complexes.Should the results look bad, mutants from a lower ranking can be selected or new residues can be picked.Virginia iGEM designed a Linux-based protein engineering tool called MUT.MUT first performs stability testing and docking to get baseline values for the future tests before it mutates the initial PDB file.However, the binding affinities for all the protecting group choices were very similar, so we chose based on a different set of criteria.Another 4 data runs were performed and can be found in the supplementary data section, but exhibit similar results.Several programs were used to asses the viability of the different protecting groups in our system.Biochemistry 46, 4466\u00964472.To find residues of interest in the catalytic pocket, we used a combination of docking data as simulated in iGEMDOCK and of structural data visualized in Ligplot to determine additional mutational focci.The following is a PyMol visualization of the protein that we compiled.As stated in its documentation, during the characterization of 4aq7, a leucyl-adenylate analogue was used to determine the crystal structure of the protein.Energistic relationships between molecules of 4aq7 are shown in detail in the 2D representation, and conformational analysis can be conducted on the 3D image.The following residues were picked for mutagenesis.Residues that returned large values in the protected leucine simulations were believed to have a high impact on the reduced viability of docking.Once an initial ranking has be completed, the user has the option to rerun docking on the selected mutants to confirm the simulation.The user inputs to MUT a protein\u0092s PDB file, residues of interest for mutation, a binding pocket, and a ligand.The editing site mutation, Thr 252, allows for the hydrolysis of Leu-tRNA, a crucial step in our overall project.22Reference:Mursinna, R.S., Lee, K.W., Briggs, J.M., and Martinis, S.A. (2004).This program was used to query for the optimal mutant structure for Cbz-Leu docking.Residues that protruded around the N terminus of leucine, the location the protecting group binds to, were thought to be possible sources of steric hindrance.Three programs are used to accomplish this task: PyRosetta conducts computational mutagenesis, FoldX tests protein stability, and AutoDock Vina performs protein-ligand docking.Of the four mutations, one is in the editing site while the other three are in miscellaneous locations around the protein.After the simulation runs, the program outputs a top ten list of mutant structures along with their files.In order to determine the relative efficiency of our enzyme, we modeled another BioBrick.These are detailed in the following figure.Pugh chart used to score and rank possible protecting groups.First, the residue had to have been shown to have a high energy during docking.Some of the criteria are practical like the cost of the protecting group and enzyme.After the reductionist approach is complete, all files are mutated to four mutants and re-scored.We modeled our system in silico to select a sterically feasible protecting group and to optimize a mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase for complementarity of its catalytic site to protected leucine, and of its editing site to leucine.MUT utilizes PyRosetta, Autodock Vina, and FoldX to mutate, test, and rank protein structures based on docking scores.MUT generates mutant structures, subjects the resultant proteins to stability testing, and ranks the results based on protein-ligand docking data.Ligplot is capable of creating a 2D image of the binding site as detailed in the crystolography file.Files that fail the tests go to the kennels.BBa_M1436 codes for

approach.Below is a flowchart that explains the algorithm of the program.The kennel system allows for two levels of simulation.The script runs mutagenesis, assesses mutant protein stability, then performs ligand docking.This method ensures that all possible combinations of mutations is tested, but is computationally intense.After a run is complete, all files are automatically ranked and ordered by binding values (more negative is better).Thus, 4aq7 represents an protein that can accurately model our system containing leucyl-AMP and LeuS.The above figure shows select data from CSM-lig

second approach would have the advantage that it takes into account the efficiency of the genetic devices, because our experiments have shown that aspects such as operator placement and translation efficiency have a great impact on the functionality of the biosensor and are difficult to predict.For the future, we envision that a model with optimized parameters could be used to predict a range of repressor concentrations for an optimal output signal and the desired sensitivity.Therefore, we investigated several crucial design aspects with our model.Simulated sfGFP production when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 8 nM repressor plasmid are used (blue lines) or when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 300 nM repressor dimer are present (green lines).A CFPS biosensor is an open system, which means that the components can be manipulated more easily than in a whole-cell biosensor.There are two fundamentally different operating modes with regard to the repressor: It can either be encoded on a plasmid and be co-expressed with the reporter, or the protein is already present in the reaction mixture.When the reporter:repressor ratio is too high, there is a strong background signal and the relative increase in the presence of an analyte is small and would be difficult to discern (orange lines in the figure).The same analyses could be performed in order to optimize a reaction with a purified repressor.Importance of the reporter:repressor plasmid ratio.As can be seen from the figure, there is a weak background signal when a repressor plasmid is used, because it takes some time until enough repressor has been expressed to suppress the expression of the reporter.According to the model, the fluorescence in the presence of the repressor plasmid should be significantly lower than in the presence of a \"neutral\" plasmid, which competes for resources but does not encode a repressor.In contrast, when the repressor protein is already present in a sufficient amount, there is no background signal and the signal in the induced state is twice as high.In view of these results, a pre-existing repressor protein is the better option for a CFPS biosensor.In contrast, when the ratio is too low, an induction is not possible because of the strong repression and because most resources are used for the expression of the repressor (blue).Moreover, the signal in the presence of an analyte is weaker due to the competition of reporter and repressor mRNA for resources.We then compared the results to a simulation in which the same amount of repressor dimer was present from the beginning.Otherwise, further tests and adjustments to the model parameters are necessary in advance.Using this procedure, it is also possible to generate test strips that include several spots that detect the same analyte, but give a signal at different analyte concentrations.This would allow for the amount of repressor to be precisely controlled.The results showed us that the ratio of the plasmid concentrations is very important for a functioning biosensor.Our model accurately describes the expression of sfGFP in our cell-free protein synthesis and is able to predict the effects of the competition of two plasmids for resources.We chose this operating mode for the characterization of our biosensors and used a cell extract that had been prepared from cells expressing the necessary repressor or activator.One crucial component is the repressor, because its amount is decisive for the sensitivity and background signal of the biosensor.Furthermore, when the intensity of the fluorescence is to be used for quantification, it is possible to obtain a larger linear range using several spots with different detection limits.Currently our model uses parameters for repression and induction which were determined for the lac operon.To analyze the differences, we modelled a CFPS reaction with equimolar amounts of reporter and repressor gene in the non-induced and fully induced state.Given the parameters of our model, a ratio of 1:1 yields the best compromise between low background and strong induced signal (green).We tested this prediction with a plasmid that encodes the arsenic repressor and a second plasmid that contains the arsenic operator in front of sfGFP (BBa_K1758300).For future applications it would therefore be desirable to determine the specific parameters of the repressor proteins we worked with.This is a convenient method, however, it would be an even better option to add a purified protein to the reaction.8 nM of each plasmid were used.The position of the arsenic operator relative to the T7 promoter in the PT7-arsO-UTR-sfGFP plasmid is not ideal, as the distance needs to be very small to efficiently block the T7 RNA polymerase (Karig et al.Plasmids encoding sfGFP, either with the arsenic operator (arsO) or without, were combined with plasmids encoding the arsenic repressor (arsR) or mRFP1.A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that in the absence of an analyte, the translation rate constants are most important for the output signal.Therefore, the model could significantly reduce the number of necessary experiments.Therefore, we looked more closely at the importance of the plasmid ratio.This is sufficient for making qualitative predictions about the behaviour of our biosensors, but it does not enable us to predict exact concentrations for the different biosensors we used.These concentrations could then be tested in the lab.Therefore, the amount of active ArsR was likely lower than predicted by the model.These results show that the model predictions are only valid for optimized genetic constructs and CFPS conditions.", "notebook": "Find out how we developed and optimized our own cell extract.See

approach had to be established and the processing of the output signal had to be taken care of.To detect the date rape drug ingredient ?-hydroxy butyrate (GHB), we had to adjust only two components of our setup: The repressor protein and the DNA sequence that the protein recognizes.By the way, you just have to spend 16 \u00a2 for each reaction At first, you have to combine all reagents that are necessary to conduct cell-free protein synthesis.We consider our cell-free biosensor an outstanding instrument for the detection of harmful substances in liquids.Our measurement prototype for easy and

"Considering biosafety aspects it has to be unequivocally proven that the purified protein extract and plasmid DNA preparation are cell-free.In his opinion, the risk that possibly released DNA from our system is incorporated by competent cells and that these cells proliferate and spread out is so low and unlikely that it is negligible.Regarding biosafety, it would be a clear advantage if reproduction would not be occurring in the CFPS environment.2013), DNA is a molecule that bacteria from the environment can coincidentally absorb (C\u00e9r\u00e9monie 2004) and that therefore can affect the environment.To conclude, we think that in future applications PRIA can be used outside of the lab under the condition that these concerns are addressed properly.For further assessments of PRIA s biosafety status we interviewed Dr. Mathias Keller from the district government in Detmold (\"Bezirksregierung Detmold\").He lists examples for the environment where a close contact between DNA and cells are likely to occur, like sewage treatment plants, our digestive tract and the soil.In conclusion, our expert assured us that cell-free systems are safer and better to use for the user than cell-based systems.We asked how the district government deals with the release of DNA from genetically-modified organisms into the environment.For the use of these systems one does not need to be a user of a genetic engineering facility.DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2013.00005 Nielsen, Kaare M.; Johnsen, P\u00e5l J.; Bensasson, Douda; Daffonchio, Daniele (2007): Release and persistence of extracellular DNA in the environment.We want to do a risk assessment to determine to which extent DNA is released in the environment when using PRIA.This is true no matter how the DNA is produced.Guan, Zheng-jun; Schmidt, Markus; Pei, Lei; Wei, Wei; Ma, Ke-ping (2013): Biosafety Considerations of Synthetic Biology in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition.According to Dr. Keller the release of pure DNA is not governed by the German Genetic Engineering Act.So to which extent is the biosafety affected?Moreover, the release of DNA happens permanently.Cell extract is generated by cell disruption, for example via sonification, followed by centrifugation steps in which the cell debris are separated from the molecular machinery needed for CPFS (see CFPS protocols).(2015) who \u0096 by creating an ebola sensor \u0096 showed how cell-free synthetic biology can be a medium to transfer the findings and ideas from the lab to the field.We contacted experts in the field of cell-free biology and asked them about this topic.Biologically/chemically he sees as advantages that the stability, durability and insensibility against external impacts in cell-free systems are considerably higher than in cellular systems.That points out the public awareness when it comes to microbiology and genetically modified organisms.However, none of these problems occur when the system is cell-free.(2013): Preparing synthetic biology for the world.It is also possible to modify the DNA that is used: For example it is conceivable that it includes a kill-switch or comparable safeguards (Moe-Behrens et al.We wondered if it was possible to create a biosensor based on cell extract that is completely cell-free.We consider this a great contribution to the iGEM community.According to Dr. Keller, the uptake of DNA depends on the uptake frequency, the encoded genes (e.g.Therefore, it is important that there are no GMOs in the product.One of those is for example the problem that GMOs are brought outside of the laboratory.PRIA is an in vitro method and can be compared to ELISA, an assay which is broadly used for example in hospitals (Lequin 2005), in terms of biosafety.conferring antibiotic resistance or encoding toxins) and the selection advantage for the transformed cells.Although the cell disruption is very efficient (we had a maximum of 8 colony forming units in 100 \u00b5L of final cell extract), there are still some cells left after this procedure.At first glance, our two approaches the PRIA and CFPS differ when it comes to biosafety concerns.Projects based on cell-free approaches will probably benefit to a great extent from our findings and results.The Act just deals with the handling of GMOs.Sun, PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology explains: \"[...] we have seen both cases where colony forming units come out of the extract and when they don t.\"Although plasmid DNA persists only to a minor degree in host cells (Moe-Behrens et

climate problem and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nowadays, the human civilization has achieved unprecedented prosperity.Our previous experience has shown that if we want to build a closed-living

developing the entire circulation system design from the bottom and making full use of the advanced functions among different species, avoiding weaknesses, ultimately achieving material circulation and life support efficiently without any pollution.\"[10] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1960s, several major advanced countries and organizations tried to build a enclosed environment by the Earth s biological regeneration of life support system to simulate material recycling process in space environment.Since 1989, the European Space Agency (ESA) has cooperated with several agencies to launch the MELiSSA, a microecological life support system research program.The ultimate goal is to include multiple compartments to achieve complete closure of the water and gas cycles.we can\u0092t just simply \"add or subtract\" biomass but search for the new ideas,develop the entire circulation system design from the bottom and make full use of the advanced functions among different species, avoid weaknesses, ultimately achieve material circulation and life support efficiently without any pollution.Even the most advanced life support system, the International Space Station (ISS), can only work as a partial closed-loop system, circulating oxygen and controlling pressure.Furthermore, scientists have been neglected the role of microbes in the overall simulation system until they found the important effects of microbes in the entire simulated closed ecosystemlater.Finally, the efficiency of energy utilization and material recycling in natural ecosystems is too low,which requires a large number of ecological space in order to satisfy the astronauts  living requirements (average 100 square meters per person).And the whole story of survival reflects the core idea of the astronauts life support system - recycling everything that can be recycled.Astronauts material consumption reaches 11 tons / year, while the spacecraft to transport 1kg of goods will cost $ 10,000.If Human wants to fly out of the earth like the interstellar travel in science fictions, the primary task is to maintain a reliable system of life support.To solve the complex problems of long-term space travels such as material cycling and life sustainment relying on the existing biological resources of the earth s ecology,we face the challenges including the cost,volume, flexibility and availability.[11] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1970s,the former Soviet Union successfully constructed BIOS-3 enclosed material circulation system, which could achieve 100% of the water cycle and gas circulation.The whole system was completely isolated from the outside air and water, but the system failed to achieve the basic material quality balance, and ultimately failed.For the past half a century of human exploring space, the entire system is basically non-renewable, So it is called Open Loop System.Astronauts can easily obtain a variety of supplies, including food, water and oxygen generators, and achieve the circulation of the waste.It is only performing short-term tasks or in orbit on the International Space Station.Because the biological platform has a self-replicating function and the flexibility biology, there has been a very marginal and mysterious branch, Space Synbio.Space biosynthetic biology will be a catalyst for the development of synthetic biology and the aerospace industry.In 1986, Edward Bass from the USA established a private laboratory, \"Biosphere 2\", to see whether it can create a completely closed life-support system, and all the lives in system live in harmony.Manned space flight only reached the moon from the time when the first human rocket was launched.At present, space exploration continues to expand, from near-Earth orbit to deep space exploration, from landing the moon to Mars survival which may come true in the future.However, due to the neglect of themicroorganisms,which isa very important loop in the system,the closed experiment only lasted for two weeks in such system.The platform of synthetic biology ensures that the search process is more reliable.[7] In this process, it is difficult to bring all the air, food and water needed.From 1968 the release of \"2001 space roaming\", so far, most of the ideas in the film have been realized, except for the space roaming.Artificial simulation is difficult to achieve.The second is that the stability of the natural ecosystem is based on the huge biomass,but the one of the small-scale simulation system is frail.Designing the travel plans to go to the moon and Mars or even further place is very different.He used human excrement, Mars soil and the water from rocket explosion to grow potatoes.University of California, Berkeley, Adam P. Arkin summed up six major challenges of the space The challenge can give people the power to innovate and inspire imagination.Over the past 20 years, we have cut down over 130 million hectares of forest, but only get 47.5 million hectares of arable lands [2].Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project[J].In the film, Mark lived in the desolate Mars, making the

became an unavoidable and insurmountable problem for scientists.", "description": "We hope to use E.coli to realize the re-use of carbon dioxide metabolized by astronauts, like green leaf, and to synthesize Glycogen which can be reused by astronauts,using formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.This is the part that connects the front and the back of the entire Blue Leaf project, and also determines whether the entire device can be used to synthesize starch with a carbon compound as the sole carbon source.The route cannot synthesize Glycogen with only one carbon compound as the sole carbon source, and is not suitable for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.In the first part, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.The device,which can maintain the carbon cycle in the

validation of this pathway and the efficient expression as well as the catalysis of both enzymes.Figue4, Part II, New Synthesis of D-xylulose by Formaldehyde Assimilation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third part, Glycogen Metabolism can be used to synthsize D-xylulose into Glycogen.The use of mature carbon dioxide fixation technology turns the carbon dioxide in the air into formic acid[3], and then gets formaldehyde which is the sole carbon source by specific enzyme.[5] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, in order to enhance the efficiency of the combined catalysis, we used synthetic protein scaffolds technology[6].The second part is the new formaldehyde condensation pathway which can achieve the efficient synthesis of D-xylulose from formaldehyde.[1] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last year, the iGEM team AACHEN2015 used E.coli to design a pathway for Glycogen by methanol.However, the five carbon compound needs to be obtained by E. coli from other glycolytic pathways.Though they aimed at using methanol to form glycogen, in fact,they overlooked one of the most important aspects![4]Figue3, Part I, Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide.[2]They used electric conversion to get methanol,which is the raw material.From the 1960s, the former Soviet Union, the United States, the European Union and other space organizations have tried to construct bio-regenerating life-support system under earth  s closed environment in order to simulate the material recycling process in space environment.The former can turn formaldehyde condensation into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and hydroxyacetaldehyde.The latter condenses two intermediate products into a five carbon sugars Compounds: D-xylulose.This year, we have designed a new carbon cycle system.In other words, E. coli must consume at least one molecule of six carbon sugar to synthesize a glycogen hexose sugar monomer.\"Rapid Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by an Iridium Pincer Catalyst Immobilized on Carbon Nanotube Electrodes.\"We have optimized the protein scaffold sequence and performed functional validation on the basis of the iGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team.For a closed system such as a spacecraft, how to maximize the recycling efficiency of material and energy in order to maintain the astronauts\u0092 long-term space activities has become an inescapable but difficult problem for scientists to overcome.", "design": "But this idea about utilizing the Methanol Condensation Cycle and Glycogen Metabolism into the synthesis of glycogen has stimulated us greatly.To synthesize Glycogen in the presence of one-carbon compound as the sole carbon source, we need to find or even design a new pathway for the synthesis of five carbon saccharide from formaldehyde.A simple and effective method for the complex reaction involved with so many enzymes should be found to enhance the interaction and cooperation within each enzyme and improve the efficiency of the overall reaction.The toxicity of the formaldehyde is high and unstable, especially for the cells.The synthesis of glycogen was achieved by using the synthetic route of formaldehyde to D-xylulose, the partial methanol assimilation pathway and glycogen metabolic pathway.Figue 6, Formic acid to formaldehyde conversion pathway.[4] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We improved the scaffold protein on the basis of the IGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team[5] and used it in our designed pathway-from formaldehyde to D-xylulose.Thus, based on the ways to fix the carbon dioxide by electro-transformation, a one-carbon product with low toxicity and high electro-conversion efficiency should be found, and then we design the pathway of it to assimilate.Though this new approach, we have achieved the synthesis of D-xylulose by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.It is beneficial for the synthesis of carbohydrates to use formic acid as carbon source.However, in this synthetic pathway, an obvious defect lies on the additional requirement of a five-carbon sugar used together with methanol and then to form glycogen.This route aforementioned cannot be used to synthesize Glycogen only with one carbon compound as the carbon source, so as to be deficient for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.Besides, we applied this part in our scaffold protein(BBa_K2155012) with other cohesins, and proved it was functional.Figue 4, CO2 Reduction Thermodynamics & The Strategy of Hydrogenation of CO2 to Formic Acid.This part is \u0093Bearing before and after\u0094 part in Blue Leaf as well as the determined factor of whether the entire device can achieve the synthesis of starch by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.In order to improve the efficiency of the multi-enzyme reaction system, Self-assembly Protein Scaffold was used.It transforms methanol into formaldehyde that will be condensed into six-carbon sugar with five-carbon sugar produced in E. coli, and then goes to the subsequent glycogen polymerization.Since the photosynthesis efficiency of plant is only about 1%[1] , it is clearly not a practical way to use the green leaves to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft where the space is narrow while the demand for energy is huge.The scaffold protein consists of the following components:Figue 3, Synthetic protein scaffolds improve the efficiency of multi - enzyme reaction.Last year, the iGEM team from Aachen University of Technology in Germany[2] designed a synthetic pathway for Glycogen with the methanol from E.coli and finally won the Best manufacture prize.The system, in other words, will convert carbon dioxide into the sugar compounds offering heat supply, so as to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft and ensure the astronauts  long-term space travel or space presence.Based on a registered cohesin(BBa_K1830004) submitted byiGEM15_Concordia\u0092s, we isolated the cohesin module of this part from the linker, which makes following team could adjust linker\u0092s length according to their requirement when they use this cohesin.In the next route, we used Methanol Condensation Cycle.Design a system to achieve the re-use of carbon dioxide in the spacecraft.D-xylulose was phosphorylated to 5-phosphate-xylulose and then went into the methanol assimilation pathway.We found two enzymes with different condensation functions, BFD and TalB , the former could condense formaldehyde into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and Glycolaldehyde.In this way, the target protein could be anchored firmly to the scaffold.Therefore, the linker\u0092s length is a main influence of multi-enzyme system\u0092s reaction efficiency.Amazingly, the conversion efficiency could be more than 80%.Cohesins were expressed on the scaffold, while Dockerins co-expressed with the target enzyme to form a fusion protein.Microscopically, it could automatically assemble the fusion protein with the corresponding Dockerin, making different enzymes next to each other.We know that complex enzyme reaction often has a problem that the products of the last enzyme cannot be timely and competely transported to the next enzyme, making the overall reaction efficiency low due to the location of different enzymes in the space far apart.There are few pathways of formic acid assimilation in nature, and we have searched through the literature to find a path that has been validated.In the case of Blue Leaf, a system in which multiple enzymes catalyze the reaction, the efficiency of the coordinated reaction between the enzymes determines the efficiency of the overall catalytic reaction.Cohesins and Dockerins were the major components of protein scaffolds, each with a reactive group that recognizes each other and mosaics.They got the methanol,which is the raw material, through the electric conversion.[8] Moreover, the toxicity of formate is much lower than that of methanol.So our experiments also focused on the validation of this pathway and the efficient expression and the efficient catalysis of both enzymes.From the macroscopic point of view, it can improve the local enzyme concentration and substrate concentration, thereby enhancing the multi-enzyme reaction system.\u0093Computational Protein Design Enables a Novel One-Carbon Assimilation Pathway.\u0094 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 112(12): 3704\u00969.It is clear that formic acid is more suitable as a sustainable carbon source than methanol.[9]Figue 5, Investigator Peng Kang, from TIPC of CAS, designed a electrical device which can transform carbon dioxide into Formaldehyde.", "human_practice": "And we went to the laboratory to study the related mature theories and the first time

"modeling": "Since we have demonstrated the pathway to convert methanol to D-xylulose in vitro, herein, we would like to look at its possibility in vitro by using stoichiometric In a short word, a stoichiometric model is a combination of reactions related to target molecules which form a metabolic network that could offer bird view of For this work, we built up the model based on present model of E.coli from CellNetAnalyzer(Steffen and J 2007), and added our reactions into it.Besides, the production of D-xylulose was increased because of supplement of other reactions.Figure 1 The

Different stationary phase temperature: by reducing the temperature we might be able to reduce growth and obtain more Curdlan  Yeast cell walls are naturally made up of various layers which are represented in the following diagram.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 68: 163\u0096173  [2] R. Zhang and K. J. Edgar (2014) Properties, Chemistry, and Applications of the Bioactive Polysaccharide Curdlan.Curdlan belongs to the class of biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses.Plos one 93:525\u0096531 To sum it up, we would like to produce Curdlan in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then sulfate it before spraying it on grapevine leaves as a preventive treatment against Downy mildew infections.Therefore, the only alkali soluble components are a mix of (1?6)-?-glucans(1?3)-?-D-glucans.We therefore decided to over-express the Curdlan metabolic pathway by inserting into yeast (INVSC1 strain ) an inducible promoter (Gal1) for the ?-glucan synthase gene (Fks1) hoping that this would allow the cell to produce Curdlan in greater quantities.Annu Rev Immunol 20:197\u0096216 [13] Jagodzinski PP, Wiaderkiewicz R (1994) Mechanism of the inhibitory effect of curdlan sulphate on HIV-1 infection in vitro.We rapidly eliminated Bacillus subtilis from our possible hosts due to its lack of enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of (1?3)-?-glucans (Figure 5).In addition, curdlan gels have medical and pharmacological potential, for example in drug delivery through sustained and diffusion-controlled release of the active ingredient.The protective effects for the bacteria are due to the fact that Curdlan forms a capsule that completely surrounds the outer cell surface of bacteria.(aimanianda et al 2009) In order to separate the two compounds, we plan on using (1?6)-?-glucanases in order to obtain a solution of (1?3)-?-glucans and therefore our Curdlan molecule.All the other Curdlan clinical applications in cancer, diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia etc.\u00bb  \u00ab Because, as we explained on the problem page, Downy Mildew is a real problem for the Aquitaine region.This is demonstrated by the study of a double mutant of pmr4 which restore the susceptibility to mildew.Glucan molecules are polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers linked by glycosidic bonds and one of them is called Curdlan , a (1?3)-?-D-glucan.Also, activation of a Pathogenesis-Related protein called PR1 in grapevine is regulated by the salicylic acid signaling pathway .[16] To conclude, activation of natural defenses before the invasion of pathogens is a way to improve the plant resistance against infection and to reduce the use of chemicals products.Figure 2: Schematic representation of the (1?3)-?-glucan synthetic pathway [2]  Before starting the project, we took a few weeks to decide which host organism we would use and how they could be useful.We planned on amplifying our fragments by PCR and creating different biobricks with different assemblies of our genes and plasmids in order to find the effect of each gene on Curdlan production and to verify the efficiency of our promoter.The safety of Curdlan has been assessed in animal studies and in vitro tests [4,5] and it is approved for food use in Korea, Taiwan and Japan as an inert dietary fibre.Furthermore, non-sulfated Curdlan doesn t trigger the response through a mutant gene: pmr4.[10] Furthermore, Curdlan derivatives are members of a class of compounds known as biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses.This is the medium which is used for Curdlan production in Agrobacterium and is also interesting since it is a minimal medium which allows us to easily vary parameters and optimize production.Gal1 promoter and HIS3 was extract by PCR from pFA 6a-HIS3MX6-pGAL-3HA .On the other hand, we will integrate the FKS1 gene into the iGEM plasmid pSB1C3 to get our BioBrick that we ll send to Boston.However, we found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae naturally produces Curdlan in its cell wall, like Agrobacterium.This is not the case with E. coli in our project.First, we decided to produce Curdlan with Escherichia coli , because Agrobacterium tumefasciens because both of them are Gram negative bacteria and have a lot of membrane similarity.We therefore inserted the three genes which code for the ?-glucan synthase and metabolic transporters in Agrobacterium (crdASC) into E. coli .In: WHO (ed) 53rd Meeting of the joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives.For example, it can have antitumor, anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities (see other properties of Curdlan).Commonly, the yeast cell wall is made of 5-10% of (1?6)-?-glucans and 50-55% of a mix of (1?3)-?-glucans and (1?3)-?-glucans.So, sulfation of the glucan would counteract the negative feedback effect.In Agrobacterium , three genes (crdA, crdS and crdC) are required for Curdlan production.However, more research is needed for the further development of these useful properties, in particular by reducing the cost of production.CRC, Boca Raton, pp 269\u0096286 [5] Spicer EJF, Goldenthal EI, Ikeda T (1999) A toxicological assessment of curdlan.In order to have control over the different culture perameters we also decided to use M63 culture medium.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 68: 163\u0096173  [2] M. McIntosh (2012) Recent advances in curdlan biosynthesis, biotechnological production, and applications.[1] M. McIntosh (2005) Curdlan and other bacterial (1?3)-?-D-glucans mini review.The capsule formation is correlated with cell aggregation (floc formation) and it is suggested that the capsule and floc formation together function as protective structures in cases of Nitrogen-starvation of the post-stationary phase.We then tried to put a inductive promoter ahead of the relevant gene by homologous recombination.[1]  [1] M. McIntosh (2005) Curdlan and other bacterial (1?3)-?-D-glucans mini review.Indeed, Curdlan production in Agrobacterium requires Nitrogen Starvation and its growth parameters need to be relatively precise.All three genes were synthesized by IDT separately with the correct ends to allow integration in the iGEM plasmids and an easy creation of our biobricks.Since the layer of mannan and proteins as well as chitin is insoluble in alkali solutions, beta glucans are easily separated from the rest of the yeast cell wall.Trends Glycosci Glycotechnol 4:309\u0096317 [10] Kanke M, Tanabe E,(1995) Application of curdlan to controlled drug delivery.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 93:525\u0096531  [3] Adrien Gauthier (2014)The Sulfated Laminarin Triggers a Stress Transcriptome before Priming the SA- and ROS-Dependent Defenses during Grapevine\u0092s Induced Resistance against Plasmopara viticola.However, site-directed mutagenesis may be necessary when integrating the gene into the plasmid because there are restriction sites (EcoR1) that are unwanted within the HIS3 gene.The results indicate that the chemical modification of an elicitor, such as sulfated derivative of \u00df-glucans, could improve its resistance-inducer efficiency.However, since our gene sequences for crdA, crdS, and crdC originally come from Agrobacterium we decided to optimize our gene codons for E. coli with IDT codon optimization tool in order to make sure that our gene would correctly be expressed.konjac glucomannan, methylcellulose), the heating process alone produces different forms of curdlan gels with different textural qualities, physical stabilities and water-holding capacities.Manipulation of the conditions for self-assembly may allow the engineering of new materials.", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "", "notebook": "In our Notebook we provide a summary of our labwork and an overview over the used protocols.", "protocol": "", "result": "The primers used for PCR have floating tails allowing the integration of the cassette upstream FKS1 gene.Thanks to Derek Mc Cluster we tried to overexpress FKS1 gene by integrating GAL1 inducible promoter upstream of it by the homologous recombination method.The amplification product containing the selection gene and the promoter flanked by the homologous recombination of sequences is purified.For that, we designed PCR primers that flank the gene of interest taking into account the issues of specific primers to the target sequences, self-aliasing or primer annealing there between.To insert FKS1 gene into the chosen plasmid, it was necessary to amplify this gene by PCR on yeast genomic DNA.One of the first strategies to overexpress the FKS1 gene encoding a D-glucan synthase was to insert it into a plasmid compatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We designed a pair of primers specifically hybridizing upstream of the gene of interest and framing the location where construction must integrate.?

present in soluble form in healthy patients.In food industry, the additive E424 (Curdlan) is used as a thickener, stabilizer, gelling and firming agent.However, we also collaborated with the Oxford iGEM team to test the toxicity of this molecule on the bacteria that already live in nature.For the Environment Even if copper is essential for life at low doses, it is environmentally toxic at higher doses.Also, the copper-related risks are increased if added residues of this product from agricultural cultures, other food sources containing copper as tap water.This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer s disease.This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer s disease.For Humans Through the food chain, copper is an essential element for life at low doses.Indeed, when it is accumulated in the body in large quantities, it is supposed to affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain.If we want to directly use our synthetic organism on the plant, we must integrate death genes in their genomes to create organisms that are not be able to live in natural conditions.In our project, the cell can\u0092t evolve and in any manner alter the environment.After different doses were tested, an encouraging result emerged : the weekly fructose application of 100 g / ha had a similar effect than a treatment of 600 g / ha of copper.Indeed, when it accumulates in the body, it is in too large quantities, it would affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain.In 2013, the \u0093Savoy ADAbio\u0094 tested on vine plants the effect of very low doses of different sugars in order to replace the copper treatment in the fight against pests.This element has been used many times to treat mildew which has resulted in it\u0092s accumulation in the Aquitaine region.In the case of our project, we are not planning on directly applying our genetically engineered bacteria on the plant but only our purified molecule.The measure reduces the damage to the biosphere but isn\u0092t sufficient: copper sulfate is tolerated but not banished.This molecule already exists in nature, it is naturally present in the yeast\u0092s wall.Compared to copper sulfate which is a toxic compound, this molecule seems to be more environmentally friendly.In other words, we chose to spray on the vine only the cell product: Curdlan.We are not using the entire cell Another important theme is the spread of new organisms in nature.However, it is harmful if swallowed or inhaled, in cases of skin contact, eye contact (hence the compulsory wearing of gloves masks and glasses during our project) and is very toxic to aquatic organisms.In the lab, there is a specific solvent cabinet for liquid wastes.No bad impact on the environment has been identified.For now, we are still waiting for the results.The team who worked in the lab received instructions of lab safety with safety training.Most products used are classified as non-hazardous (even for the sulfation protocol).It accumulates on the soils and vineyards are polluted.It disrupts, for example, the development of mycorrhiza fungi that live in symbiosis with the plant\u0092s root to help the access to nutrients from the soil to the vegetal.To avoid confusion about the terms \"biosecurity\", \"biosafety\" and \"biohazard\", some people gave a definition of each of these terms.Since we worked with non-toxic organisms as Escherichia coli (BL21) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Invsc1), all waste that has been in contact with bacteria was put to bacterial waste in aseptic conditions but no specific security procedures needed to be put in place.This compound also modifies the biosphere since it is toxic for worms and microorganisms living in vineyard soils.We learned how to act in the case of an accident, where to find emergency showers, fire extinguishers and emergency doors.Not dangerous for Humans Our project aims to use a polysaccharide which is synthetically produced by our genetically modified organisms.It is also increasingly referred to as an \"environmental illness\".In humans, it is known that copper occurs naturally and in normal

enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and working for the UC Davis C-STEM Center.I am currently manager of the UC Davis Biomedical Engineering Molecular Prototyping and BioInnovation Lab.I joined iGEM for the experience of using biology to solve a real world problem.This summer I worked on several methods of quantifying the signal produced by our biosensor.This summer I produced an app that calculates

Genomics major at UC Davis.University of California Davis, Department of Computer Science and UC Davis Genome Center My lab\u0092s interests span a variety of topics related to evolutionary, synthetic and systems biology.Most recently I have worked on the redesign of naturally occurring enzymes for the degradation of immunogenic gluten proteins, to develop a novel CO2 fixation pathways, and design of a novel anthrax therapeutic.My name is Muntaha Samad and I am a third year at UC Davis studying Computer Science and Engineering.I decided to join iGEM, because I was interested in the engineering approach and view iGEM has towards biology.I contributed to the project mostly through outreach and wastewater collection.I have been an advisor to UC Davis iGEM teams for the past 5 years and have enjoyed every minute of it.I also assisted with hardware and hardware testing.University of California Davis, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and School of Medicine  My scientific efforts are focused on combining computational and experimental tools to develop a fundamental knowledge of enzyme catalysis, and applying those principles to design novel proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest.This summer I worked on the wet lab components of our project including experimental design and data analysis.Currently I am working with an international community on the development of Rosetta computational methodology for predicting and designing macromolecular structures, interactions, and functions.I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Biomedical Engineering and hope to one-day own my own biotechnology business.I am very interested in the engineering and design of power grids, as well as in transistor organization for processors and microprocessors.I also really enjoy robotics and am interested in pursuing a career working with smart prosthetics.I first found out about iGEM while i was at my junior college by my biology professor.I also contributed to the outreach of the project and sample collection.For this endeavor I worked closely with Gabe to first understand the biology behind our biosensor and then with various educators to figure out the most effective way to present this information.She told me about the competition after i had expressed interest in genetic manipulation and synthetic biology.My primary interest is to improve mentorship and educational opportunities for students interested in applications of systems and synthetic biology.I joined iGEM because I think there is a lot to learn from nature in designing more adaptive, resilient, and efficient systems.This summer I led our team\u0092s efforts in exploring our problem space and iteratively refining our project goals.My current focus is on the design of novel biofuel and commodity chemical biosynthetic pathways, the development of novel therapeutics, and the general understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function.I

wiki.", "background": "", "description": "They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme\u0092s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan\u0092s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan\u0092s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303.It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water\u0085Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samplesContinue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds\u0085 or 1 60-fold)Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallelWhen we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan.In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!Triclosan\u0092s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH.Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan.Cognizant of these two points, we developed an \u0093antimicrobial awareness app\u0094 to extend our solution more broadly.In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels).Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi!IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI.*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme.We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition dataTriclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3].Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28].As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI.We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water.However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and functionScience Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationshipsLearning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and functionIn regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:Providing a teacher\u0092s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.These include a teacher s guide, classroom powerpoint, and assessment questions -- all of which can be downloaded below: Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting.The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally: be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae).\"Kinetic and Structural Characteristics of the Inhibition of Enoyl (acyl Carrier Protein) Reductase by Triclosan.\"In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn\u0092t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our projectOf the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18].From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI\u0092s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19].Nature 485(7397): 185-194.Rodricks, Joseph V. \"Triclosan: A Critical Review of the Experimental Data and Development of

synthesis.Notwithstanding, NADPH is significantly more expensive than NADH[24], so instead of accommodating for S. aureus FabI, we decided to remove it from the FabI team.We were down to the \"Fab 5\".An alternative substrate was thus necessary for our biosensor to be used in a practical setting.To achieve our goal of developing a cost effective triclosan biosensor then, we were tasked with (a) discovering an enzyme that met all of our criteria and (b) identifying an alternative substrate that would enable practical use.(2001) 48 (1): 1-6. doi: 10.1093/jac/48.1.1[12] Mechanism and Inhibition

a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.The second obstacle Ms. Moriarty mentioned are the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum.pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA.(2000) \u0091Inhibition of InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by triclosan and isoniazid\u0092,Biochemistry, Vol.We realized early on that if we wanted to promote responsible chemical use, we had to go about the issue responsibly ourselves.We found all living organisms except for the Archaea, who synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it\u0092s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI\u0092s from different organisms[5].\"Structural basis for the variation in triclosan affinity to enoyl reductases.\"The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA\u0092s role as an acyl carrier.Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are \u0093good\u0094 or \u0093poor\u0094 distractors, answer choices designed to test common misconceptions, and common statistics like the \u0093facility factor\u0094 and \u0093discrimination factor\u0094 that test how easy or hard a particular question is and how well a question help to discriminate different skill levels in a class, respectively.1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry (Bba_K771303), 3 FabI proteins taken from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae.To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution.We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum.We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae.[11] Courtney Slater-Radosti, Glenn Van Aller, Rebecca Greenwood, Richard Nicholas, Paul M.

Antimicrob.This meant making a concerted effort to understand the complexities of the issue, learning from the past and present in developing a viable solution for the future, and assessing the implications of our proposed solution.After identifying public awareness as an effective catalyst for change, we researched civic engagement initiatives and identified that successful civic engagement measures fostered a sense of individual and collective responsibility and provided a sense of agency that s grounded in reality.Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.Mechanism and inhibition of the FabI enoyl-ACP reductase from Burkholderia pseudomallei.\"Common themes in redox chemistry emerge from the X-ray structure of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase.\"Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay.\"Enoyl-ACP Reductase (FabI) of Haemophilus influenzae: Steady-State Kinetic Mechanism and Inhibition by Triclosan and Hexachlorophene.\"Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al.(See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex.Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.In explaining the first iteration of the lesson plan, which involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement, Ms. Moriarty raised some valid concerns.\"Slow-tight-binding Inhibition of Enoyl-acyl Carrier Protein Reductase from Plasmodium Falciparum by Triclosan.\"Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices.Pagliarulo talked about how designing an educational activity is a process by which you identify objectives and criteria for success, come up with a prototype, test it, evaluate it based on criteria, and iteratively refine it.What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.We didn\u0092t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle.We later found out we didn\u0092t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent!This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g.aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12].As a result, we identified high school students as a potential audience and a lesson plan as a viable medium for promoting responsible chemical use.(May 2009)[6] RJ, Heath, Rubin JR, Holland DR, Zhang E, Snow ME, and Rock CO. \"Mechanism of Triclosan Inhibition of Bacterial Fatty Acid Synthesis.\"Validation of the survey instrument would require us to assess statistics known as \u0093validity\u0094 and \u0093reliability\u0094 [REF #.3].A good educational plan has a plan for assessing the quality of the assessments too.Dr.[18]In addition, the commercially available native substrate for FabI (crotonyl-CoA) is unstable and costly.Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, \u0093antimicrobial footprint app,\u0094 to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20].10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00284.x [19] Eriksson M, Johansson H, Fihlman V, Grehn A, Sanli K, Andersson MX, Blanck H, Arrhenius \u00c5, Sircar T, Backhaus T. (2014) Long-term effects of the antibacterial agent triclosan on marine periphyton communities.We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day.Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, we connected with CRS\u0092 network of teachers in our area -- just a portion of their network of 1,400 teachers.[21]In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run.Moriarty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being constraints imposed by lack of funding and needing to teach to a curriculum.In regards to budget constraints Mr. Moriarty talked about the difficulty in planning field trips due to lack of funding.We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme\u0092s activity on trans-2-pentenal.We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM.The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme\u0092s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme\u0092s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/B.One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction.To screen a representative subset of FabI\u0092s from all available domains of life, we mined the literature and found every characterized FabI with published inhibition data.Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan.To instill a sense of agency, we wanted to engage students in a hands on activity; however, current methods of detection are not well suited for a classroom environment.Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10].However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay: and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.This need motivated our wetlab effort in developing a reliable and cost effective triclosan biosensor that could be used in conjunction with our lesson plan to raise awareness and accountability around triclosan use.We then took a step back to assess the possible implications of our lesson plan.It was unclear however which of the thousands of FabI enzymes we should use for our biosensor since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a FabI gene.While we are excited to share our lesson with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope.A. Koenig, A. S. Beatty, Developing assessments for the next generation science standards (National Academies Press, 2014).Ref #.2 Russell, J.Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set.These require different assessment instruments.assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we\u0092re interested in assessing but rather the student\u0092s ability to decipher the questions.[22] Vick JE, Clomburg JM, Blankschien MD, Chou A, Kim S, Gonzalez R.Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) supports efficient operation of a functional reversal of ?-oxidation cycle.[18])We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI.\"Triclosan causes toxic effects to algae in marine biofilms, but does not inhibit the metabolic activity of marine biofilm bacteria.\"\"Antimicrobial Spectrum of Triclosan, a Broad-spectrum Antimicrobial Agent for Topical Application.Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use.We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens.He gave us some insight:crafting \u0093layered\u0094 questions that assess different levels on Bloom\u0092s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom\u0092s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom\u0092s questions might test a student\u0092s ability to apply the core lessons to new situationsdifferent objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.We couldn\u0092t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA.In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.Ms.To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout.We harkened back to Bruce Hammock\u0092s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum\u0092s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another.Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a \u0093pre post test\u0094.What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost.We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part.Percent inhibition was calculated by:The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme.Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute.Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents.100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADHWe are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen.To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid.This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.Dr.\"Triclosan Offers Protection against Blood Stages of Malaria by Inhibiting Enoyl-ACP Reductase of Plasmodium Falciparum.\"We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry!Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment?Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale.The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory.(2008) A pathogenic fungi diphenyl ether phytotoxin targets plant enoyl (acyl carrier protein) reductase.Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students.And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.We decided to use our device\u0092s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion.[32] Bornscheuer, U. T., G. W. Huisman, R. J. Kazlauskas, S. Lutz, J. C. Moore and K. Robins (2012).We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond.Human practice issues motivated our project and have informed its design every step of the way.This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences.To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.Ms.[28] Perozzo, R., M.

Zhang and Rock (2005).The insights gained from these numerous conversations informed the shape and development of our lesson plan at multiple levels, including the teaching resources that are required to use it in the classroom.", "design": "They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme\u0092s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan\u0092s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan\u0092s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303.It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water\u0085Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samplesContinue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds\u0085 or 1 60-fold)Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallelWhen we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan.In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!Triclosan\u0092s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH.Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan.Cognizant of these two points, we developed an \u0093antimicrobial awareness app\u0094 to extend our solution more broadly.In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels).Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi!IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI.*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme.We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition dataTriclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3].Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28].As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI.We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water.However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and functionScience Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationshipsLearning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and functionIn regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:Providing a teacher\u0092s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.These include a teacher s guide, classroom powerpoint, and assessment questions -- all of which can be downloaded below: Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting.The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally: be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae).\"Kinetic and Structural Characteristics of the Inhibition of Enoyl (acyl Carrier Protein) Reductase by Triclosan.\"In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn\u0092t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our projectOf the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18].From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI\u0092s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19].Nature 485(7397): 185-194.Rodricks, Joseph V. \"Triclosan: A Critical Review of the Experimental Data and Development of

5\".An alternative substrate was thus necessary for our biosensor to be used in a practical setting.To achieve our goal of developing a cost effective triclosan biosensor then, we were tasked with (a) discovering an enzyme that met all of our criteria and (b) identifying an alternative substrate that would enable practical use.(2001) 48 (1): 1-6. doi: 10.1093/jac/48.1.1[12] Mechanism and Inhibition

Antimicrob.This meant making a concerted effort to understand the complexities of the issue, learning from the past and present in developing a viable solution for the future, and assessing the implications of our proposed solution.After identifying public awareness as an effective catalyst for change, we researched civic engagement initiatives and identified that successful civic engagement measures fostered a sense of individual and collective responsibility and provided a sense of agency that s grounded in reality.Furthermore, crotonic acid has a less electrophilic group adjacent to the allylic double bond, highlighting the high selectivity of FabI for the electronic structure of its substrates.Mechanism and inhibition of the FabI enoyl-ACP reductase from Burkholderia pseudomallei.\"Common themes in redox chemistry emerge from the X-ray structure of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase.\"Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay.\"Enoyl-ACP Reductase (FabI) of Haemophilus influenzae: Steady-State Kinetic Mechanism and Inhibition by Triclosan and Hexachlorophene.\"Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al.(See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex.Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.In explaining the first iteration of the lesson plan, which involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement, Ms. Moriarty raised some valid concerns.\"Slow-tight-binding Inhibition of Enoyl-acyl Carrier Protein Reductase from Plasmodium Falciparum by Triclosan.\"Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices.Pagliarulo talked about how designing an educational activity is a process by which you identify objectives and criteria for success, come up with a prototype, test it, evaluate it based on criteria, and iteratively refine it.What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.We didn\u0092t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle.We later found out we didn\u0092t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent!This is highly consistent with the enzyme mechanism in which an allylic double bond is reduced when adjacent to an activating group, such as an electrophilic carbonyl (e.g.aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12].As a result, we identified high school students as a potential audience and a lesson plan as a viable medium for promoting responsible chemical use.(May 2009)[6] RJ, Heath, Rubin JR, Holland DR, Zhang E, Snow ME, and Rock CO. \"Mechanism of Triclosan Inhibition of Bacterial Fatty Acid Synthesis.\"Validation of the survey instrument would require us to assess statistics known as \u0093validity\u0094 and \u0093reliability\u0094 [REF #.3].A good educational plan has a plan for assessing the quality of the assessments too.Dr.[18]In addition, the commercially available native substrate for FabI (crotonyl-CoA) is unstable and costly.Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, \u0093antimicrobial footprint app,\u0094 to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20].10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00284.x [19] Eriksson M, Johansson H, Fihlman V, Grehn A, Sanli K, Andersson MX, Blanck H, Arrhenius \u00c5, Sircar T, Backhaus T. (2014) Long-term effects of the antibacterial agent triclosan on marine periphyton communities.We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day.Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, we connected with CRS\u0092 network of teachers in our area -- just a portion of their network of 1,400 teachers.[21]In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run.Moriarty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being constraints imposed by lack of funding and needing to teach to a curriculum.In regards to budget constraints Mr. Moriarty talked about the difficulty in planning field trips due to lack of funding.We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme\u0092s activity on trans-2-pentenal.We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM.The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme\u0092s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme\u0092s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/B.One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction.To screen a representative subset of FabI\u0092s from all available domains of life, we mined the literature and found every characterized FabI with published inhibition data.Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan.To instill a sense of agency, we wanted to engage students in a hands on activity; however, current methods of detection are not well suited for a classroom environment.Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10].However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay: and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.This need motivated our wetlab effort in developing a reliable and cost effective triclosan biosensor that could be used in conjunction with our lesson plan to raise awareness and accountability around triclosan use.We then took a step back to assess the possible implications of our lesson plan.It was unclear however which of the thousands of FabI enzymes we should use for our biosensor since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a FabI gene.While we are excited to share our lesson with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope.A. Koenig, A. S. Beatty, Developing assessments for the next generation science standards (National Academies Press, 2014).Ref #.2 Russell, J.Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set.These require different assessment instruments.assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we\u0092re interested in assessing but rather the student\u0092s ability to decipher the questions.[22] Vick JE, Clomburg JM, Blankschien MD, Chou A, Kim S, Gonzalez R.Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) supports efficient operation of a functional reversal of ?-oxidation cycle.[18])We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI.\"Triclosan causes toxic effects to algae in marine biofilms, but does not inhibit the metabolic activity of marine biofilm bacteria.\"\"Antimicrobial Spectrum of Triclosan, a Broad-spectrum Antimicrobial Agent for Topical Application.Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use.We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens.He gave us some insight:crafting \u0093layered\u0094 questions that assess different levels on Bloom\u0092s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom\u0092s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom\u0092s questions might test a student\u0092s ability to apply the core lessons to new situationsdifferent objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.We couldn\u0092t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA.In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.Ms.To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout.We harkened back to Bruce Hammock\u0092s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum\u0092s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another.Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a \u0093pre post test\u0094.What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost.We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part.Percent inhibition was calculated by:The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme.Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute.Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents.100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADHWe are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen.To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid.This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.Dr.\"Triclosan Offers Protection against Blood Stages of Malaria by Inhibiting Enoyl-ACP Reductase of Plasmodium Falciparum.\"We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry!Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment?Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale.The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory.(2008) A pathogenic fungi diphenyl ether phytotoxin targets plant enoyl (acyl carrier protein) reductase.Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students.And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.We decided to use our device\u0092s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion.[32] Bornscheuer, U. T., G. W. Huisman, R. J. Kazlauskas, S. Lutz, J. C. Moore and K. Robins (2012).We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond.Human practice issues motivated our project and have informed its design every step of the way.This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences.To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.Ms.[28] Perozzo, R., M.

Sakaiensis originated at a recycling plant, we thought to contact labs that have discovered bacteria in wastewater treatment facilities.Because Seabin is still in development, we brainstormed possible future integrations of our sensor device with their platform.This encouraged us to try thinking of locations where we could find bacteria capable of metabolizing terephthalic acid.Thus, the energy produced by our MFC will help send a signal back to researchers to indicate the location of plastic in the ocean.We had up to this point wanted to use the electricity generated by our MFC to power a floating device like the Seabin.And, while the Seabin may be too large to suck in microplastics, our system would actually work better with microplastic because they are easier to break down.", "modeling": "Using the paper as a blueprint, our team constructed a model in Matlab (code available at the bottom of this page) that enables its users to enter values for adsorption, desorption, and catalysis constants and values for initial substrate and enzyme concentrations to immediately receive values for the Michaelis-Menten constant and the percentage of substrate that is bound to the enzyme at any point in time.The paper, \"Calculation of Protein Extinction Coefficients from Amino Acid Sequence Data\",5 guided us through the process of finding this crucial coefficient for a wavelength of 280 nm and allowed us to use the number of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine amino acids present in PETase to arrive at an extinction coefficient of 39170 M-1 cm-1.As our team and mentors investigated more sophisticated variations of Michaelis-Menten, we uncovered a highly relevant paper, \"Surface Enzyme Kinetics for Biopolymer Microarrays: a Combination of Langmuir and Michaelis-Menten Concepts\"4.Since our assessment of enzyme kinetics was purely comparative (that is, we judged the efficiency of surface kinetics by comparing them to kinetics in solution), we focused our investigation on the parameters that are unique to surfaces: adsorption and desorption.Supporting Future Experiments: Calculating Extinction CoefficientsDuring our wet lab work with PETase this summer, we managed to successfully isolate the enzyme.To understand conditions involving small pieces of plastic, our team relied on Michaelis-Menten, a widely-applied model for enzyme kinetics.Although we have the necessary tools to measure the optical density (OD) of a solution that contains PETase, OD measurements are not sufficient on their own to determine concentration because we do not know how much light the enzyme absorbs.This is where modelling comes into the picture.\"Surface Enzyme Kinetics for Biopolymer Microarrays: A Combination of Langmuir and Michaelis-Menten Concepts.\"Though PETase is the most efficient PET-degrading enzyme discovered to date,1 it by no means degrades plastic instantaneously.Below is the equation from the paper that enabled us to determine the extinction coefficient: Although this technically the coefficient for the denatured protein, the paper states explicitly that there is a \"relatively small difference\" between this coefficient and the coefficient of the native protein at 280 nm.However, we soon realized that the Michaelis-Menten model, with its references to substrate concentration, assumes that the substrate is in solution and would therefore be unsuitable for describing the kinetics associated with large solid substrates.An overview of Michaelis-Menten:3 The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) corresponds to the substrate concentration at which the speed of the reaction is half of the maximum possible velocity: Our team initially intended to compare the Michaelis-Menten constant associated with small plastics suspended in solutions to that of large pieces of plastics.It is valid at the beginning of reactions and is especially compatible with our reactor design considering that the products of the reaction are funneled to another chamber where none of the original substrate or enzyme are present.In future quantitative experiments involving PETase, it would be useful to have a means by which we could calculate the concentration of this enzyme in a given solution.In order to calculate the concentration of enzyme present, our team also needs to know PETase s extinction coefficient.The task required us to understand enzyme kinetics under two broad sets of circumstances: When the pieces of plastic were small enough in size so that they were effectively suspended in a solution.Another assumption is that the enzyme must be either free or bound to the substrate.Informing our Design: Modelling Michaelis-Menten KineticsAs we were refining the design of our plastic-sensing device, we were having a difficult time accounting for the lag between plastic uptake and plastic degradation.Prior to beginning our work, we ensured that the assumptions inherent in the model were reasonable for modelling PETase activity:2The model assumes that the product is not converted back into the substrate.The assumption also makes sense considering that our enzyme functions by breaking down polymers: after the reaction, the newly formed monomers no longer fit in the enzyme s active site.This would require us to apply models geared towards heterogeneous reactions that involve interactions between a solid substrate and an enzyme in solution.The extinction coefficient of an enzyme describes how much light the enzyme absorbs at a given wavelength.We realized that understanding degradation rates as determined by enzyme kinetics would allow us to adjust our reactor design to minimize the lag in signal.It states that it is reasonably accurate to calculate it \"directly... from amino acid

"protocol": "", "result": "Further, this is evidence that the induction system we designed has strong control over PETase-sfGFP expression because we see almost no absorbance when the cultures were uninduced, and strong absorbance otherwise.In conclusion, this validates that PETase is catalytically active with our sfGFP fusion.tsuruhatensis Metabolizing Terephthalic Acid (TPA)Now that we have catalytic PETase and have optimized pH for our engineered E. coli, we want to be able to produce a signal in the presence of our PET degradation byproduct, terephthalic acid (TPA).Plastiback can be easy to use with a fluorescent \u0093systems check\u0094 and also break down PET.Now that we have the PETase enzyme working, we want to optimize the pH to have the most enzyme activity and fastest growth rate of E. coli.Because our recombinant PETase protein is the only his-tagged protein in the cell, we would expect to see a signal only from the band which contains PETase.This demonstrates that D. tsuruhatensis and the exogenous mediator are successfully working together in the microbial fuel to produce electricity from terephthalic acid, and that we are able to read out a signal from the presence of terephthalic acid.Unexpectedly, we also see a PETase-sized band in lanes 2,3, and 4, which should only have a band at 70 kD for the PETase-sfGFP fusion.In the visualization experiment, we can also test whether our inducible system is working because we would expect uninduced cells not to fluoresce, or at least fluoresce at a low basal level.They also confirm that we have inducible control over our construct because the uninduced sample shows basal expression.Delftia tsuruhatensis TPA utilizes TPA as the sole carbon sourceSelecting Exogenous Mediator Type and ConcentrationBefore we could test our MFC with D. tsuruhatensis and TPA, we had to determine which exogenous mediator would be optimal for our MFC.If you are wondering what the dark band below the PETase band is, it is lysozyme that we used in our cell lysis protocol.Constructed BioBricks for PETase and confirmed presence of protein using sfGFPConstructed BioBricks with secretion systems for PETaseValidated PETase expression through SDS Page and Western blotValidated PETase enzymatic activity through pNPB substrate assayCharacterized growth of three bacteria species in TPA minimal mediaDemonstrated TPA signal can be detected by voltage increase in microbial fuel cellAfter constructing our system, we needed to prove that it functions the way we designed it to.Although we confirmed the presence of our protein with sfGFP visualization, an SDS Page will further confirm by showing that a protein of the correct weight is being expressed.Not willing to sacrifice this ease-of-use feature, we set out to show that PETase-sfGFP could still be catalytically active.We adapted an assay used by the UC Davis 2012 Team that could characterize PETase\u0092s esterase activity with a colorimetric readout.Additionally, we see a band at 70 kD in lanes 2 and 3, which is the expected size of PETase-sfGFP fusion.Yoshida et al (2016) A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate)As shown in the graph below, there is a big dropoff in growth between pH 8.5 and pH 9.0, therefore the happy medium between E. coli growth and PETase enzyme activity is around pH 8.5.In conclusion, this Western demonstrates that we have inducible control over PETase expression.After constructing our PETase-sfGFP fusion plasmids and demonstrating we had inducible control PETase expression via sfGFP visualization, SDS Page and Western Blot, we were ready to test whether the PETase-sfGFP construct catalytically active.At 30 kD, we see a band which corresponds to the approximate expected size of PETase (28.6 kD).After the voltage of D. tsuruhatensis in the presence of methylene blue and M9 plateaued, we injected terephthalic acid into the mix.From the original paper published on PETase1 we knew that the PETase could be catalytically active in our chassis organism E. coli, but we didn\u0092t know whether the upgrades we made to the system would interfere with the catalytic activity.To show that any change in absorption was due to PETase-sfGFP fluorescence rather than other artifacts of the cell lysate, an uninduced control was run with pNPB substrate.Cells were induced with 0.4M, 0.1M, or 0M IPTG for either 6 hours or overnight, at either 15 or 30 degrees C. After expression, cells were then lysed according to our ultrasonication protocol, and supernatant and pellet were collected for the SDS Page gel.While the SDS page can show a protein of the proper size is being expressed, a Western allows us to probe the identity of protein itself.Before performing the SDS Page we grew up T7 lysY Iq cells containing a plasmid with PETase under control of the T7 promoter.Our final step in showing that we can produce an electrical signal from TPA was to demonstrate a voltage surge in an actual microbial fuel cell using D. tsuruhatensis, methylene blue, and terephthalic acid.To this end, we reached out to Parley for the Oceans, an organization dedicated to tackling threats to our oceans.The background is absorbance is likely due to the sfGFP fusion, which typically emits most strongly at a different wavelength but would also absorb some at 405nm.Lysozyme was run as a control, which you can see has a dark band in the same location.Below are our results:Induced PETase-sfGFP fusion is catalytically active.PETase fused to GFP is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate over time.Cells were lysed, and triplicates of induced culture lysate were mixed with pNPB substrate or the same lysis buffer they were already in.Without inducer, otherwise identical cell lysate has low absorbance as it is not expressing PETase or the GFP tag (brown).This experiment again demonstrates our system\u0092s inducible control: the blue box shows there is no band in the absence of IPTG.Upon the addition of PNPB substrate, absorbance increases (pink trend) suggesting that PETase is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate.For the SDS Page protocol, please refer to our experiments page.Likewise, the substrate by itself has low absorbance (blue).Our results indicate that PETase-sfGFP has background absorbance without the pNPB substrate, but that with the pNPB substrate absorbance increases, showing that PETase-sfGFP is able to catalyze pNPB into 4-nitrophenol which will absorb at this wavelength.We put either methylene blue or neutral red into a plate reader with the E. Coli overnight to observe which condition would result in the largest reduction of methylene blue or neutral red.As shown in the graph below, D. tsuruhatensis with M9 (medium with no carbon source) didn\u0092t grow as well as D. tsuruhatensis with M9 and TPA.To control for the background absorption of pNPB, just the substrate was also run.To make PETase easily detectable via Western Blot, we designed our constructs to include a \u0093His tag\u0094 which is targeted by a commercially available antibody.We hypothesize this is because the PETase GFP fusion is being degraded by proteases because it is so large.PETase has a weight of 24 kDa, so the band is exactly where we would expect to see PETase.After contacting Parley, we were redirected to their Junior Project Manager, Lisa Gran, who sent us 10g of \u0093mixed raw plastic\u0094 from the organization\u0092s most recent beach cleanup.In the control that has not been induced (0M IPTG), we do not observe a band between 20 and 25 kDa.In our induced sample, we observed sfGFP fluorescence at a magnification of 100x.The image below shows that the best exogenous mediator type and concentration is methylene blue at 0.005.Delftia tsuruhatensis, Methylene Blue and TPA in Microbial Fuel Cell: Voltage over timeOur team achieved our objectives and successfully managed to demonstrate PETase enzymatic activity in a laboratory setting.Although you can still observe some baseline sfGFP fluorescence, the induced sample is much brighter and has many more cells fluorescing.It is also important that our inducible promoter is truly controlling protein expression and uninduced samples do not produce much PETase.The largest color change would indicate that the bacteria had efficiently reduced the exogenous mediator.We hypothesize the smear we see between 70 kD and 30kD in lane 2 is because of the same phenomenon, such that the PETase-GFP fusion is being chopped into varying length fragments, each which has a histag and therefore shows up on the blot.Future directions of our project would include characterizing degradation of the acquired mixed plastic to simulate a real-world situation and work towards optimizing our system.1Yoshida, Shosuke et al.In the future, our team envisions our enzyme degrading plastic collected directly from the ocean.This band is strongest in lane 1, which contains lysate from our PETase construct that is unfused to GFP and induced with IPTG.By simply shining a UV light on the cell culture, an ocean plastic researcher without synthetic biology experience can determine whether Plastiback is working or not based simply on fluorescence.For a more detailed description, please refer to the project experiments page.D.In particular, the sfGFP fusion we made to allow Plastiback to be easily serviced by ocean researchers might interfere with the enzyme\u0092s active site, for example.On the right is the uninduced sample, also at 100x.The assay, called the p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) substrate assay, demonstrates enzyme activity when the breaking of an ester bond in the substrate produces 4-Nitrophenol.The sfGFP tag produces some absorbance reading which is why the green trend line is not closer to zero.In order to produce an electrical signal from TPA in our MFC, we have to first demonstrate that our bacteria can metabolize TPA.Finally, we see no signal in lane 5, which was lysate from cells containing the same construct as lane 1, but uninduced.Because we wanted to test with a bacteria known to work with exogenous mediators, we ran this preliminary test with E. Coli.By running an SDS-PAGE as described above, we could separate all the proteins in the cell by size.Showing our protein is inducibly expressed: SDS Page and Western blotNext, we can validate protein expression further with SDS Page and Western blot visualization.Our graph below shows that after adding terephthalic acid, the voltage spikes from just below 90mV to around 120mV.The individual specks in the following photo on the left are cells.", "safety": "What opinions do these people have about your project?Our product is intended to be used as a plastic-mapping and plastic-degrading device for ocean researchers and others concerned with the distribution of plastic in the ocean.Future directions of our project are mechanical design solutions to the following important questions: How do we prevent small animals from getting trapped in the device?Will the device stay afloat and be easy to retrieve from the ocean?What happens when it s all used up?On a farm, in a factory, inside human bodies, in the ocean?Because our prototype is meant to be used in the ocean, we envision a bioreactor design that ensures the engineered microbes act as a closed system that is not released into the ocean environment.Lastly, because the Delftia bacteria in the microbial fuel cell is not genetically modified, its escape does not pose a significant risk.If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?Direct benefits of a successful and efficient plastic-sensing system, such as Plastiback, will be felt by researchers looking to map the distribution of plastics in the ocean, who have no alternative to physical sampling.At our current stage of research, we have determined that PETase production exerts a significant metabolic load on our expression cells, making them unlikely to be able to survive in the ocean environment.The influx of plastic will make that difficult, but future directions for research will include solidifying design to prevent engineered microbes from escaping into the ocean environment.Because the ocean surrounds us and touches each of our lives every day, this application will benefit the global community.As part of the prototype stage of our design, we are considering the environmental impact of the product in the oceans.Plastiback also has the added benefit of being able to collect plastic and degrade it, converting these fragments, especially microplastics which otherwise pollute the ocean and interfere with the lifecycles of marine organisms, into electricity.To prevent our engineered microbes from being released into the environment, we followed our host lab\u0092s guidelines for proper disposal of organic waste.Parley for the Oceans also sent us a typical sample of ocean plastic.Estimates of plastic in the ocean are currently derived from surveys by research crews hauling nets through the ocean and hand-counting pieces of plastic3.This included appropriate clothing, covered shoes, lab coats, goggles, and disposable gloves.When choosing bacteria to use in our microbial fuel cell for their special ability to degrade Terephthalic Acid(TPA), a by-product of PET plastic degradation, we were careful to select only BSL1 organisms.\u0093Bottles, Bags, Ropes and Toothbrushes: The Struggle to Track Ocean Plastics.\u0094 Nature 536.7616 (2016): 263\u0096265.When working with such chemicals, we were careful to only work under the fume hood.This being said, our future work includes testing bioengineered control mechanisms such as a kill switch or synthetic amino-acid dependency 2 to make the risk of escape and proliferation in the environment even smaller.Considering the implications of synthetic biology tools to the world beyond the lab, It is important to maintain safe and ethical use of engineered organisms.We transported materials between our lab and the Northeastern team\u0092s lab in sealed containment to prevent release.To prevent exposure, we wore basic personal protective equipment in the lab at all times.Plastiback\u0092s contribution to ocean plastic research will affect how well the effects of plastic pollution are

abilities and the fact that it is a new discovered protein inspired us to work with UnaG.As part of this iGEM project, research has been done on the newly discovered green fluorescent protein called UnaG.This is the first fluorescent protein to be found in a vertebrate species, giving it a range of biochemical properties that differs from proteins found in the original FP family - one of the most astounding ones being that fluorescence occurs only when a ligand binds non-covalently to the protein, namely bilirubin.Induction of fluorescence of UnaG by the addition of bilirubin.Instead of binding a fatty acid molecule, the ligand of UnaG is bilirubin, which binds non-covalently to the center of this \u00df barrel.During the summer we created three different UnaG biobricks; one with a hexahistidine tag suitable for affinity chromatography, one with the hexahistidine tag and a flexible linker of six amino acids suitable for fusing to other proteins, and lastly one biobrick with only the flexible linker attached to UnaG.This feature could make UnaG suitable as an inducible marker by the addition and removal of bilirubin to cells.In addition to the affinity tag, the original sequence was also modified to include C-terminal flexible linker (GSG)2 in case the protein would be part of a fusion construct.Secondly, it fluoresces only when a bilirubin molecule is bound non-covalently to the protein.The binding buffer for UnaG contains 10 mM imidazole, the washing buffer (to remove the excess protein from the column) contains 20 mM imidazole and the elution buffer contains 350 mM imidazole.This does not interfere with 3A assembly, but a variant of the BioBrick without the flexible linker also exists.IDT sequenced the entire pUCIDT-Amp vector including the ordered insert as part of their quality control workflow, so their results were used as a reference when doing modification to the plasmid.The IDT plasmid contains the lac-promoter so it is possible to do test expression directly with IPTG.UnaG has shown the ability of being fused to other proteins via a flexible linker both on the C terminus and the N terminus, making it suitable to use as a fusion marker.At each step of the experiments, sequencing was performed using the iGEM standard VF2 and VR verification primers to ensure CDS integrity and especially to avoid introduced frameshift mutations.In addition to mutagenesis experiments, small-scale expression tests were performed to verify that UnaG expresses under our laboratory conditions (Kumagai et.al (2013) purified and crystalized the protein from E.coli, so in theory it should be functional in prokaryotes).In the original paper (Kumagai et al., 2013) the authors obtained the UnaG sequence from a cDNA library of unagi eel muscle.The result of the degradation are two toxic compounds; carbon monoxide (CO) and the bilirubin, were as it is only the carbon monoxide that is possible for the body to excrete easily (Mugnoli et al.The pigment also has the ability to conjugate with three types of proteins that are involved in the transport and the metabolism of bilirubin in vivo (Bonnett et al.In addition, none of the fractions fluoresced when bilirubin was added.Since sequencing confirmed that there are no mutations, and we previously managed to obtain impure functioning UnaG during the small-scale experiments of UnaG, the conclusion was that the IPTG solution was faulty and did not manage to induce the T7 promoter driven UnaG expression.Moreover, unlike all other fluorescent proteins of today, UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, meaning that it can be used as a marker protein in research under hypoxic conditions.1976).Hyperbilirubinemia, also called Jaundice disease or icterus (www.mesh.kib.ki.se), occurs when either the formation of bilirubin glucuronides or the excretion of these does not work in the correct manner.After successfully obtaining UnaG assembled with a variety of promoters, mutagenesis was performed in order to create several variants of the BioBrick for future use.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0140972 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco) created by the enzymatic reaction of haemoglobin degradation.There is a slight blue shift in the fluorescence (UnaG is 498/527 nm ex/em and Chlopsid FPI and FPII 489/523 nm ex/em).These contains two glucuronic acids per bilirubin molecule and the compound seems to simply be an effect of bilirubin\u0092s three dimensional structure.One chain of glucuronic acid is enough to make the bilirubin excretable, but diglucoronides can also occur in the human bile.However due to the way the final product is created, the UnaG sequence had a 50% chance to be incorporated in reverse, which was the case.(I)Since UnaG was discovered fairly recently, no mutagenic variations of the protein have been developed with improved characteristics than those of wtUnaG.Consequently the concentration of bilirubin and glucuronic acid accumulates in the body (Buchan, 1826).After the column is equilibrated with ion binding buffer, the buffer it switched out with 0.3 M NiSO4 and a new equilibration step is made with 5 CV\u0092s of ion solution.According to Akiko Kumagai and his team, the quantum yield of holo-UnaG is 0.51 and it is stable in a pH ranging from 4 to 11 (I).UnaG does not seem to be present in any of the fractions 1-7.Afterwards 5 CV of wash buffer is pumped through to remove of all the excess protein still in the column.UnaG is a fluorescent protein that was recently discovered in eel muscle (Anguilla japonica).Since the glucoronic acid contains several COOH- and OH-groups the bilirubin conjugate becomes more hydrophilic than the bilirubin alone.The column is equilibrated with 5 CV of binding buffer, afterward 25 ml of the binding buffer is mixed with the UnaG lysate and loaded onto the column.The researchers suggest that this blue shift stems from the fact that the 57th amino acid in UnaG is asparagine, whereas Chlopsid FPI and FPII contain a histidine at this site.Bilirubin exists in all vertebrates and is a metabolite of the heme group in hemoglobin.Annotations: 2_3F - UnaG under a strong constitutive promoter BBa_K880005 + bilirubin1_5M - GFP under a medium constitutive promoter BBa_K608011 (control)RFP - pSB1C3

PBS - phosphate-buffered saline solution with lysozyme (control)bilirubin - 1mM bilirubin solution in DMSO (control)After observing the small-scale expression results, plans for large-scale purification were designed.All of the fractions were then tested for the target protein using SDS-PAGE.Common properties for these compounds, among which bilirubin is included, is that they can diffuse through biological membranes in the placenta, blood brain barrier and hepatocytes.After centrifugation at 4\u00b0C and 10 000 g for 1 hour, the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 \u00b5M pore filter and loaded to a Ni2+ affinity column, also called IMAC.Alignment of the DNA sequences of UnaG and the Chlopsid proteins show 54% homology.In fact, BR is the actual fluorophore of UnaG.This part has been designed for studying the properties of the protein in vivo, since the high positive charge of the affinity tag could interfere with its function or localization.Upstream of it lies a 6xHis affinity tag, separated by an additional Serine amino acid to increase flexibility between the tag and the protein.When BR binds to the cavity of the protein, it emits green light at 527 nm.Since the haemoglobin is located inside the red blood cells, the protein is hidden from the catabolism.Downstream of the part lies a short Glycine-rich flexible linker to minimize the effects of possible protein fusion.(2015) Adaptive Evolution of Eel Fluorescent Proteins from Fatty Acid Binding Proteins Produces Bright Fluorescence in the Marine Environment.This is part retains all the features, including the RFC25 prefix and suffix, but now the flexible linker is properly expressed and in case of fusing to another CDS would not cause premature termination.Finally, to avoid potential interference from the 6xHistidine affinity tag, BBa_K2003012 was created based on BBa_K2003011.After staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destaining, the band corresponding to UnaG\u0092s expected size (15.6 kDa) was not observed anywhere.The isolation and characterization of bilirubin diglucuronide, the major bilirubin conjugate in dog and human bile.These cool features, alongside the fact that it is always exciting to work with new discoveries, made us want to add this protein to the iGEM toolbox!The UnaG sequence itself was excised from the IDT plasmid using EcoRI and PstI and ligated into pSB1C3 backbone cut with the same set of enzymes.(I)UnaG is a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP).Thereby it becomes possible for the bilirubin to leave the liver and go along with the bile, through the kidneys and then finally get excreted with the urine.In this part, the six amino acids were removed (again through PCR), as well as the Serine linker in between.is almost never present (if so the molecule would have been directly polar and lipophilic) (Mugnoli et al.An exception is an NsiI site in the N-terminal 6xHis tag, but a BioBrick without it was also made.The human being\u00b4s survival is dependent on the monoglucuronides, but not on the diglucuronides (Gordon et al.This protein is interesting firstly because it is about half the size of other fluorescent proteins that are being used today, making it suitable as a fusion protein.In the registry it is annotated as BBa_K2003010.It is only when the exchange into new red blood cells takes its place that the haemoglobin becomes exposed and decomposed by either fagocytosis or haemolysis.1985).Bilirubin is naturally excreted in the liver by, with the help of enzymes, conjugating with the sugar glucoronic acid to create glucuronides.The structure of bilirubin.Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.The molecule has a tendency to form several derivate of bilirubin such as biliproteins, several conjugates and glucuronides etc (Harris, Kellermeyer, 1970).The results verify that UnaG does not fluoresce in absence of bilirubin.Afterwards the column had to be charged with Ni2+ this is done with a ion binding buffer (50 mM Na+CH3COO-, 300 mM NaCl, pH4).This discovery suggests possibilities of changing the emission wavelength of these proteins by mutagenesis comparableto what has been done on GFP for the past 40 years.They contribute to the transport of lipophilic compounds, often fatty acids.To avoid unspecific fluorescence, cell debris were pelleted before the experiment and small aliquots of the supernatant were added to 200 \u00b5L thin-walled PCR tubes.Figure 1.No other fluorescent protein has a ligand that binds non-covalently to it.Therefore suites of different BioBrick promoters were extracted from the 2016 distribution to test for expression.No indications that the diglucuronides are more biological efficient have been noticed so far.It originates from the muscle fibers of the Japanese Unagi eel Anguilla japonica.Even at the pH-values where the COOH-group is in an ionic state the formation of Figure 1C is predominant.In these forms the pigment creates several hydrogen bonds between the NH/O-groups and OH/-groups, which in turn makes the hydrophilic COOH- and NH-groups not available for polar interaction with their environment.The bilirubin molecules have a tendency to create different complexes with other proteins as well, such as serum albumin.Bilirubin does not exist naturally in lower classes of organisms such as bacteria and yeast, so it would have to be added exogenously when research is being done on these types of cells.Bilirubin can only bind to UnaG in its unconjugated (4Z,15Z) form, meaning that wild-type UnaG shows high specificity to this particular molecule.Comparison in different species of biliary bilirubin-IX? conjugates with the activities of hepatic and renal bilirubin-IX?-uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases.The Effect of pH on Green Fluorescent Protein: a Breef Review.The bilirubin is difficult to excrete since it is a non-polar compound and therefor not soluble in water (Fevery, J et al.High levels of bilirubin are toxic and it can result in neurologic harm that causes deafness, delayed development and cerebral pares (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco).UnaG is a \u00df barrel structure containing eleven \u00df strands - a typical quality for FABPs.Consequently the bilirubin becomes insoluble in water and methanol, but easy to dissolve in chloroform (Mugnoli et al.Chlopsid FPI and FPII are also bilirubin inducible.Note that this part is designed with RFC25 (Freiburg Standard) prefix and suffix in mind, hence it contains additional restriction sites, that do not affect normal 3A assembly but enable in-frame protein fusion without creating stop codons.is present when bilirubin is in liquid and solid constellations (Le Bas, Allegret, et al.Structure of bilirubin IX? (isopropylammonium salt) chloroform solvate, C33H34N4O62?.2C3H10N+.2CHCl3.Acta Crystallographica Section C Crystal Structure Communications,39(9), 1287-1291. doi:10.1107/S0108270183008252Karolinska institutet, https://mesh.kib.ki.se/term/D007567/jaundice-neonatal, Retreived 2016-08-11.Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco.Bilirubin is not very soluble in water, so the stock 1mM solution was prepared in DMSO instead.Breaking open the cells was performed using Qsonica Q700 titanium-tip sonicator since lysozyme has nearly the same size as UnaG and would make purification more difficult, as well as just slower and less efficient compared to sonication.Kumagai, A., Ando, R., Miyatake, H., Greimel, P., Kobayashi, T., Hirabayashi, Y., Shimogori, T., and Miyawaki, A.UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, making it suitable for research executed under anaerobic conditions where FPs are not functional.(III)(I) Kumagai, A. Ando, R. Miyatake, H. Greimel, P. Kobayashi, T. Hirabayashi, Y. Shimogori, T. Miyawaki, A.Those include a medium constitutive promoter (BBa_K608006), a strong constitutive promoter (BBa_K880005), IPTG inducible promoter (BBa_J04500), and a T7 promoter (BBa_K525998).", "design": "The feature area is where channels can be placed and is the part of the design which will actually be translated into a PDMS chip.The total running length of the heat shock channel is 2.276 cm and the part of the heating channel which runs parallel with the heat shock channel is 1.41 cm.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the electroporation chip.However there were still some problems with warping (about one out of four turned out to be good), so we went back to the drawing board to create our finalized design.The basic design is a box which is 2.2x3.3x2.5 cm.The heat shock channel itself is 300 \u00b5m wide at its thin part and 800 \u00b5m wide at the broader parts, it is 500 \u00b5m high in all parts.Early in the summer it was decided that we would primarily work toward creating a functional chip for heat shock, and if there was time to make a electroporation chip and design an incubation feature/chip.The running channels in the electroporation chip are 200 \u00b5m across and 100 \u00b5m high, while the \u0093channels\u0094 where the electrodes are supposed to be placed are 200x200 \u00b5m.The electroporation chip was designed, printed and assembled but there was not enough time to test the transformation capabilities of the design, mainly due to difficulties in getting the electroporation electrodes firmly and correctly attached to the chip.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the heat shock chip.A schematic view of the heat shock chip can be seen in Figure 2.The feature area is 1.6x3.0 cm on the finalized designs.The inlet channel for the cell suspension is 500 \u00b5m wide and 100 \u00b5m high.Size-wise, these were about 2/3rds of the chip in Fig.This design paradigm was quickly scrapped mainly due to the moulds (and therefore the chips) easily becoming warped during the curing process.The chip in Figure 1 is about 7x3 cm (slightly larger than a microscrope slide).Figure 1: Early design: Easily made and easily warped.Smaller, thicker rectangles.We went over several iterations of designs until we settled on the box designs.The resistor which we added is theorized to produce longer and larger droplets, since these scale with the length of the outlet channel.The total distance that the liquid travels inside the resistor is 103.4 mm or about 10 cm.", "human_practice": "To make an example this manual is made specifically for heat shock transformation, but the design of the chip can be altered to fit any other purpose.When we wrote the manual we wanted it to fit the needs of smaller laboratories that might lack all the necessary equipment and prior knowledge.As a part of Human Practices we decided to develop a manual for manufacturing a microfluidic chip for heat shock transformation.After a short discussion concerning intellegent property and the writing of a contract, our files containing the design of the chip, as well as the manual while it was under progress we re sent to them.The Biohackers at Makerspace are going to test our manual in practice in the near future and we look forward to see the results from our manual and manufacturing method being used.The manual covers the full manufacturing process for a microfluidic chip based on a 3D-printed mold.The collaboration with Makerspace gave us important feedback and lead to an overall improvement of the manual.", "modeling": "The flow rate of the inlets was set to a laminar inflow with average velocity of 10 cm/s and the outlets was set to open.The initial temperature of the whole chip was set 25\u00b0C and the initial value of the velocity field was set to 0 everywhere in the channels.Fig3: Simulation progress after 0.02, 3, 5 and 10 sThe results of modelling the heat shock system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.We decided to model our design for the electroporation chip so that we could test out different designs of the chip and view the effects of changing parameters such as flow rate and channels size.Modeling the heat distribution over time in the heat transformation chip circumventedthe technical problems of measuring the temperature inside the channel which proved to be very complicated due to the small dimensions of the channels and a lack of equipment.The main goal of the model was to determine if the structure we designed would be able to generate droplets with our intended values for the flow rate of a dispersible phase, an oil phase, and a continuous phase, cell solution.In our case, we were not able to measure the exact temperature of the cell channel inside our heat shock chip.To set up the simulation we choose time dependent study and the conjugated heat transfer interface which is used to simulate the coupling between heat transfer and fluid flow.That is, your actual values may not be exactly like those shown in the model but the model can give you a good picture of what is going on inside the chip.For the electroporation model we decided to focus on a liquid/liquid interface system as these are generally easier to model and drew the T-junction in COMSOL and assigned correct materials, PDMS, oil and water.The mesh is necessary because COMSOL uses the finite element method, a numerical approach where the problem is divided into smaller parts, \u0093elements\u0094, to calculate difficult partial differential equation systems.After generating the mesh the initial values and the boundary conditions of the problem was set.This means that higher flow rates require a finer mesh and smaller time step in order for the solver to converge.The results of modeling the electroporation system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.This is a good approximation for viscous fluids.The boundary of the chip to the surrounding was set to a constant temperature of 25\u00b0C andthe boundary condition of the two inlets was set to a constant temperature of 65\u00b0C to simulate a constant inflow of 65\u00b0C water.With the help of a COMSOL simulation, we could see the heat spreading in PDMS.A mesh was generated of the drawn chip using the inbuilt mesh generating feature with the parameters set to physics-controlled mesh and element size finer.For these reasons, models are a good method of acquiring knowledge about the details of your chip, especially the details that are difficult to measure.Finally an outlet was placed at the end of the main channel.One important aspect of designing the heat shock chip was to determine how heat dissipated in the chip.The initial flow rate for both phases was set to 0 as the two phases flow rate are defined under the inlet panel for each channel inlet.The heat equation of the fluid was coupled with the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow.The geometry of the model was built in COMSOL and the domains of the geometry was assigned material specific attributes from the library like heat capacity etc.We focused on modelling the T-junction where the continuous fluid acts on an orthogonal channel with incoming dispersible fluid, leading to droplet generation.In fig 4 the geometry of the t-junction is shown as seen in COMSOL with a blue line representing the initial liquid/liquid interface.Fig4: Geometry of t-junction with initial line liquid/liquid interfaceThe wetting conditions of the walls was set to no slip conditions.The boundary conditions was set to laminar inflow and the average velocity for the continuous phase: 100 nl/min and dispersible phase: 100 nl/min.Droplet formation is thought to occur as a combination of shear stress on the dispersible fluid and a pressure drop when the dispersible fluid droplet has almost filled the entire cross section of the channel.Lastly a \u0093coarser\u0094 mesh was generated with corner refinement around the edges where the orthogonal channel(dispersible phase channel) meets the main channel (continuous phase channel).This was important in order to know if the cells are actually being heat shocked, and at what temperature.By testing a virtual chip system we get both fast and detailed information that is helpful when deciding on the actual parameters of the physical chip.The entrance length can be calculated from the formula 4A/P were A is the cross sectional area of the channel and P the circumference.This method is accurate but also has a high computational cost making it ideal for microfluidics applications where the number of droplets needed to be tracked are few.Generally interface tracking uses a fixed mesh to calculate how the interface changes between two phases.Therefore depending on the interface type, gas/liquid or liquid/liquid, the final model had to be changed to meet the requirement for each type.This structure is critical as the size of the droplets and their flow rate after formation will determine how well the cells is being transformed.It uses the regular heat equation for the heat transfer in solids and the heat equation for fluids that accounts for energy transport due to flow, heat from pressure work and viscous effects that produce fluid heating.The properties for the surface tension was defined by a liquid/liquid system and the library value for the olive oil/water surface tension coefficient was used.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "As a proof of concept we did 2 rounds of experiments on our heat shock chip, one where we compared its transformation efficiency to that of regular heat shock transformation done off-chip and one where we compared transformation efficiency on the chip at different temperatures.During the summer we made over 30 chips and numerous successful heat shock transformations using only 8.4 ng of DNA and 5.9 ?L of competent cells.This waslikely due to the primitive and direct way cells were fed into and out of the chip (usinga syringe to push in/out cells and eye-measuring to see whether cells have entered thechip makes for inaccurate timing and a lot of back and forth).For each transformation at a set temperature the amount of formed colonies can be viewed in figure 3.The average (avg) number of colonies at each temperature drops slightly when going from 55 ?C, 65 ?C to 75 ?C since the latter two contain replicates with zero number of colonies.The avg value for the number of colonies at each temperature was used to determine the average transformation efficiency, represented by the cfu/\u00b5g value and is presented in Table 3.We found that the transformation efficiency was much higher in the conventional heat shock than on our chip.There was also very high variation in the transformation efficiency among the experiments done on on the chip(which were done using similar/identical reagents).Figure 3 shows the data points for the triplicates at each temperature having a large spread of the amount of formed colonies.That is, two transformations carried out on the chip in the same manner could yield a varying number of colonies.The cleanliness of our chip was good as little to no colonies grew on the plates with only SOB run through the chip nor on the plates with only cells (negative control).The plates with bacteria transformed on the chip showed many colonies, considering the small amount of cells and DNA that were plated.On a per plate basis the highest efficiency we had was123 000 and the lowest was 0 (8 out of 50 plates had 0 colonies), with the averageseveral potential causes which could cause this large variation of results.Variation could be due to human error.Here the raw data of every transformation is presented alongside the comparison transformations we did.According to the results presented in Table 1 and Table 2 the heat shock chipdid not reach higher efficiency than conventional methods, at least with the comparison metrics used.The crosses represent each replicate, the circle is a contamination check, and the rhombs are the average amount of colonies at each temperature.The highest average value for formed colonies was at 55 ?C for the heating fluid, giving 30 colonies whilst heat shocking at 65 ?C and 75 ?C yielded 21 and 14.7 colonies.In other words, the transformation worked on our chip and it greatly reduced the amount of reagents needed since colony growth was observed on plates were only 6mL of cell/DNA suspension was heat shocked.The setupof the chip involved running heated water from a beaker through the chip and thismeans that there can be a chance that there is higher or lower thermal leakage thanexpected, leading to the transformation efficiency being affected.55 ?C showed formed colonies for each of the three replicates.Figure 3.Mean transformation efficiencies of the different chips (1-3) and conventional transformations (0).Number of colonies formed after transformation at each temperature.Calculations of colony forming units per microliter DNA were made and the mean for each chip is shown in Figure 1.", "safety": "Besides following standard laboratory safety procedures (gloves, glasses, laboratory coat) we also did the majority of our work in a fume hood or in a \u0093clean corner\u0094.Still we maintained good lab etiquette and treated it with similar safety precaution as we did with E. coli.Acrylamide - The gel used for SDS-PAGE is made from an acrylamide solution.Cured PDMS is also non-toxic and does not have any specific flammability.Chloroform - Chloroform was used for cleaning PDMS, glass/plexiglass slides and the chip molds, especially directly after receiving the molds or directly after a curing of a new chip.To keep bottles of growth media sterile, we used gas burners on the bench.Since chloroform can melt vinyl gloves to the skin we used nitrile gloves when handling it.Whenever liquid nitrogen was used, we made sure to use safety goggles, insulating gloves and worked in a well ventilated area.Nickel Sepharose Fast Flow - Resin used for IMAC loaded with Ni2+ ions is flammable.During work with liquid PDMS we always worked in a fume hood, except when we put the mold inside the laboratory oven.Furthermore we always left all chemicals related to the creating and curing of the chips inside the fume hood, to prevent any gas leaks to the rest of the laboratory.CRISPR systems as Cas9 and CPF1 have the ability to digest DNA, making them a possible mutagen.As a final safety precaution we blasted our guide RNAs against the human genome before we synthesised them, choosing only sequences that had low or no homology.The gas burners were also used to sterilize loops for streaking bacteria and to sterilize glassware at the bench.We used the E. coli strains DH5?, MG1655, BL21(DE3).Even if non-pathogenic organisms are used, some of the reagents can be harmful for humans and the environment.Chief among these were ethanol and 2-propanol, but we also used chloroform during some parts of the summer.Since liquid nitrogen expands a lot when it boils, a special thermos has to be used to ensure that gaseous nitrogen can escape.Before starting the work in the lab, the whole team attended a safety demonstration regarding the lab and lab work.Gloves should always be worn when working with SYBR safe.Liquid nitrogen - We used liquid nitrogen to snap freeze our freshly made competent cells before placing them in a -70? freezer.It should always be handled

would have to get into the nucleus.The booklet \u0093Common sense for laboratory work\u0094 by IBG, Uppsala University was available in the lab for quick referencing.However protective glasses, gloves and lab coat should always be worn since PDMS is very sticky and can easily stick to clothes or skin, where it is hard to remove and poses a moderate eye hazard.If CPF1 would end up in the cytoplasma, it would then have to be transported into the nuclei for it to be able to cut in the genome.That way, even if CPF1 was imported into our cells and then into the nucleus, it would have no nuclease activity.When possible we forwent the use of chloroform in favor of using 2-propanol or ethanol.During work with microfluidics we used some chemicals for cleaning PDMS, mold, plexiglass and glass slides prior to usage.A lab technician was available during the weeks for further support and questions.The protein would have to be transported over the cell membrane.Working in a lab involves many safety concerns.When handling the organisms, we wore lab coats and gloves when needed.While it is much less toxic and a less potent mutagen than Ethylium bromide, it is by no means completely safe to work with.Since not all team members had previously worked with bacteria or other microorganisms, the more experienced team members taught the others proper sterile technique and how to handle

as \u0093the therapeutic use of lytic bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infection.\u0094 (1) And while this technique was discovered prior to antibiotic treatments, inconsistent results and a lack of understanding caused it to be almost completely overshadowed by antibiotics.As a continuation of the 2015 WLC iGEM team s project, we have taken the idea of phage therapy for treatment of bacterial infection to a new environment: the coral reefs.(1) Finally, while a phage\u0092s ability to mutate could be seen as a safety threat, it also provides a built-in mechanism to continue to infect bacteria that have adapted a resistance to the original strain.Without zooxanthellae, corals would bleach (lose color) and die due to a lack of adequate nutrient uptake (3).Hard coral species also use the fixed carbon during the production of their Calcium Carbonate skeleton (3).Because of this the coral are, in effect, stripped of their immune defenses, and their nutrient providers.If the S. marcescens infection could be wiped out with bacteriophage therapy (see our team\u0092s previous article on phage therapy below), the coral would have the potential for rehabilitation.2 Aug. 2016.Note: this article was written by last year s WLC iGEM team, we are using it as it still applies to this year s project.TolC is a protein comprised of 471 amino acids to compose a homotrimer that forms a tapered hollow cylinder 140\u00c5 in length: a 40\u00c5 long outer membrane barrel [the channel domain] that anchors a 100\u00c5 long helical barrel that projects across the periplasmic space [1].The protein is exported through translocase, such as AcrAB, then through the TolC periplasmic entrance [1].TolC\u0092s role in antibiotic efflux is what interests us as a target for fighting multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.The complicated structure of Elkhorn contains many large branches with a full-grown coral reaching up to twelve feet in diameter(1).Part of the reason Elkhorn is such an important component of reef building is its ability to grow very rapidly.But our reefs are threatened now as never before in a myriad of ways, from pollution, dredging and destruction of the physical reef, to disease and an increasingly acidic environment affecting many aspects of our lives and placing the future of our oceans in danger.One such pressing concern for the coastal reefs of the southern United States (such as those located along the Floridian coast) has been a decimation and massive decrease in the populations of the primary reef building coral of these reefs, Acropora palmata, otherwise known as Elkhorn coral.(2) Phage therapy works based on the bacteriophages\u0092 ability to lyse specific bacteria while not harming eukaryotic cells.The early founders of phage therapy made many mistakes that ultimately led to antibiotic treatments being favored over phage therapy.These numerous traits of our reefs, that affect so many global interactions, highlight just a few of the many benefits coral reefs provide for the earth we live on.(2) The ever increasing issue of antibiotic resistance has led to a phage research revival.The most significant cause of this scarcity, however, is rampant disease, largely caused by the human pathogen Serratia marcescens.Serratia marcescens, a pathogenic species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, is known to infect humans, as well as other animals.The goal being that a phage can be isolated that will bind to the S. marcescens TolC protein.Without the coral reefs and the solid structure they provide, erosion of beaches and shorelines would proceed at significantly higher rates due to the lack of wave dissipation that reefs provide.Without reefs, many larval fish species would lack an environment in which to develop or would lack a vital link (a food source for example) in the food chain they rely upon.(2) The bacteria are able to thrive in a wide variety of environments including soil, water, and the digestive tract of their host.Phage therapy has overcome many of the obstacles that cleared the way for antibiotics to take over, and is now in many ways superior to antibiotics.This way, phages specific to the Serratia tolC gene can be isolated without having to deal with any harmful bacteria in the lab.[4]Gossard, Kimberly A., \"Genetic Profiling of the White Pox Disease Coral Pathogen Serratia marcescens from the Florida Keys\" (2014).Honors Program Theses.Specifically, the infection of Elkhorn coral by S. marcescens or \u0093white pox\u0094 can be attributed to immense destruction of the coral reefs(4).Elkhorn coral has been subject to infection by S. Marcescens since the first outbreak of white pox in 1996.(4) Also, phages are very specific, making it difficult to kill the correct bacteria with the correct phages using the technology of the time.[1] Falkowski PG, Dubinsky Z, Muscatine L, and James W. Porter: \u0093Light and the Bioenergetics of a Symbiotic Coral.\u0094 BioScience: Vol.\"Human Pathogen Shown to Cause Disease in the Threatened Eklhorn Coral Acropora Palmata.\"(1) Modern technology has also allowed for the easy and effective isolation of phages without disrupting their function.(1) Phages have also been identified with coat proteins that are harder for the body to identify as foreign.First, phages can be very specific and can be programmed to target only the virulent bacteria so as to not damage the microbiomes or probiotics.Read on for a more detailed explanation of the premise and goals of this year s project.Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) is a vital reef-building coral native to the Caribbean.Finally, the researchers faced the issue of the phages being rapidly eliminated by the body and were unable to prevent it.Due to the overuse of antibiotics, alternative treatments like phage therapy have been sought.There are also small loops present on the sides of TolC that allow for phage binding or colicin attachment.While some at the time believed that they were viruses, many of the studies hinted at phages being an enzyme that was created by the bacteria.(3) The phages create two enzymes, hollins, which perforate the plasma membrane, and lysins, which attack the cell wall.Thanks to scientific advances, many of the original problems have been solved, and phages are now even superior to antibiotics in many ways.Because of the high efficiency of S. marcescens to utilize glycoprotein components in the mucus, it is able to completely outgrow any other bacteria present.(4) The lack of knowledge also led to very inconsistent reports causing Eaton, Bayne, and Jones to write a report which deemed the technique no better than prior treatments.In addition, while the body metabolizes antibiotics, lytic bacteriophages are constantly replicating in the host bacteria and thus grow exponentially in number.Because WLC is a Christian school, we want our projects to always be rooted in our faith, which is why we chose a project involving good stewardship of the Earth and its resources.(5) There is also much less risk of resistant bacteria forming as only the target bacteria will be infected while the others remain untouched.The new surge of research being done on phage therapy continues to reveal exciting new options for the technique.In the lysogenic phase, the viral genome integrates into the bacterial DNA and goes into a hibernation allowing the cell to replicate on its own until it enters the lytic cycle.Paper 5.Importance of Reef Building Coral and Associated SymbiontsThe importance of hard corals to the global ecosystem as we know it cannot be overestimated.(5) The lack of research and understanding also led to impurities being injected into patients, further infecting them, and denaturing the bacteriophages during isolation leaving them inactive.In the lytic cycle, the bacterium is used to create parts of the phage which are then assembled.The phages do this by injecting their DNA into the host.The reasons for the low population in recent years is due to a wide variety of pressures including predation and bleaching.The outer membrane protein common to many gram negative bacteria: TolC (see our team\u0092s pervious article on TolC below), can be cloned into a plasmid and function in E. coli.The bacteria can then enter one of two phases, the first of which is the lysogenic phase.& Hughes, C. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF TOLC: The Bacterial Exit Duct for Proteins and Drugs.If, and when, a bacteria does become resistant to a phage, it is much easier and faster to find a new bacteriophage than it is to develop a new antibiotic.These two processes for the fixing of carbon into usable molecules (such as glucose) and stable calcareous molecules are large contributors to the global carbon cycle.It is thought that the tunnel assembly is supported by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.TolC is interesting because unlike other efflux pumps, TolC bypasses the periplasm.This name is given because of its resemblance to elk antlers, in both shape and the brown color given by the photosynthetic protozoans living symbiotically inside the coral\u0092s tissue.Fortunately, modern technology has had more success with phages than the discoverers.At least one of the strains causing the infection (PDR60) can be traced back to human sewage.This protein interacts with the inner membrane translocases traffic ATPase and an adaptor protein.In 2005 it was added to the endangered species list and remains there today despite many efforts to restore and revive the population.In review, the trimer forms a single beta barrel for the passing of proteins.(5)While phage therapy is not a new technique, it has only recently started a comeback as a viable antibacterial treatment.Once a phage is isolated, it could potentially be used to treat infected coral.[1] \"What Is Phage Therapy?\"A review of the mechanisms that drive Serratia towards diverse lifestyles.Modern knowledge of bacteriophages gives hope that phage therapy will not only work with but surpass antibiotic treatment.Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria to reproduce.", "design": "", "human_practice": "The students finished out the day with a snack and spent some time polishing up their presentations.We made it to day four of the camp and the students seemed as engrossed as they did on day one!The responses to this survey statement showed an initial preference towards disagreeing with the statement that \u0093Genetic Engineering is Unethical\u0094 with some students indicating a lack of opinion on the topic due to the 20% of \u0093I don\u0092t Know\u0094 responses.After the camp and our rigorous educational efforts on the uses for and importance of, genetically modified organisms in the medical field, the students reflected those efforts with strong indications towards agreement that GMO\u0092s should be used as vital medical treatment options.After completion of the camp, the students indicated a shift in opinion on the statement \u0093You are Familiar with GMO\u0092s\u0094 towards agreement with the survey statement, providing evidence that over the course of the camp we presented information in such a way as to admirably educate on the topic of Genetic Modification.Harrison, Elise, and Jack presenting at Biotech Info NightIn late September, we held an informational night for the students on our campus.Throughout the week, the students learned various concepts on bioengineering, and they also spent quality time in the lab completing hands-on procedures.It is humbling to see that no one did not know whether genetic engineering is ethical or not; they all had an opinion in the matter.In our forty-five minute discussion with these students, most of them were able to formulate a better perception of how GMOs work and how they are applied to our world.It was interesting to see that this particular answer in the survey did not change significantly.Before commencement of the camp, the students showed a general lack of knowledge and disagreement with the topic of familiarity with GMO\u0092s.After the camp completed, there were no responses indicating a lack of opinion, with all students showing disagreement with the question, providing confidence in the education provided throughout the week.After completion of the camp, the students showed a strong opinion on the statement presented, with all students indicating that they believed Genetically Modified Organisms were not inherently dangerous to human health.The last lab of the week, the students spent time examining living coral samples, invertebrates, and bacteria, among other microorganisms under various microscopes.Following the presentation, we had multiple students approach us and ask how they could get involved with the WLC iGEM team.Lastly, towards the end of the day, the students went to work on their group projects, preparing to present on and share past iGEM projects with each other.Overall, the post-camp surveys indicated that the students greatly enjoyed the camp, learned a lot, and would love to return for an advanced, or altered summer camp in future years!The students were asked to agree or disagree with the statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).After the presentation at Biotech Info Night, there seems to be more students who disagree that GMOs are dangerous to human health.The students were asked to agree or disagree with the statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).The camp finished off with a fun jeopardy style bioengineering game that the students seemed to enjoy immensely.During the summer, the 2016 WLC iGEM held a week-long bioengineering summer camp for high school students.In the lab, Dr. Henkel led the students through plating and culturing of microorganisms from an external source point, specifically, raw eggs, chicken, and beef.This shows that our presentation was successful in informing the students on various concepts of biotechnology.As a result of biotechnology info night, there seemed to be an increase in the knowledge and opinions formed by the students who attended.This was the perfect way to set the tone for the rest of our summer camp as we deal with not only basic biology, but also some controversial topics.We then dove headfirst into science, first with the Central Dogma of Biology prepared by Dr. Werner.We did not have much time to cover all the topics involved with biotechnology, but we were able to get the ideas into the students\u0092 minds.There is less variation in the students\u0092 answers.Following our discourse and our discussion on ethics, the students seemed more likely to disagree with the fact that these matters are unethical.The day wrapped up with the students putting the final touches on their presentations for Friday morning.Friday began with the last devotion of the week and quickly moved into the students presentations on past iGEM projects.In lab, after lunch, Harrison led the students through an integrated lab where the students performed PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, and a Restriction Digest.This project was a chance for them to see what iGEM was all about and hopefully get them more interested in joining an iGEM team when they get to college.Today was a very exciting and enjoyable day for the campers!The following graphs are the result of the surveys which allow for analysis on how successful our camp was for our students.Over the course of the camp, we sought to incorporate and discuss bacteriophages in great detail as they play an integral part in our current project.Most of these students have attended Christian schools all of their lives; therefore, a short conversation on the matter will not sway their minds.The students showed a very strong initial lack of knowledge on the issue of use of Genetic ally Modified Organisms for Medical Treatments.This graph is strongly indicative of the general lack of information in the community on Bacteriophages and their uses as shown by the large percent (80%) of responses that were in strong disagreement with the statement or selected \u0093I don\u0092t Know\u0094.Students were able to learn about the structure of DNA and how it becomes RNA with licorice and marshmallows.The pre-camp and post-camp responses to the statement \u0093GMOs are inherently dangerous to Human Health\u0094 indicate an initial lack of knowledge on this topic due to the large volume (40%) of \u0093I don\u0092t know\u0094 responses.This is great for the continuation of the 2017 iGEM team and we have begun to involve new members into our project.Gina first shared the principles of water with magnetic models so the students could understand the difference between hydrogen, ionic, and covalent bonding.However, it is encouraging to see how many students disagree with the statement.There was an almost unanimous vote in the post-survey among the students.Dr. Henkel had the students plate the prepared samples on selective plates in order to incorporate bacterial identification into the lab and introduce the concept of gram negativity and gram positivity among other differences used in bacterial identification.It was the student\u0092s turn to make bacteria glow red, and we used the plasmids they had isolated on Monday in the mini prep to do so.At the end of the day, we introduced the campers to the group project that they would be completing.The small scale science that we are performing in the lab this week really came to life.After the camp, the surveys showed a drastic split in survey response with a large number being in agreement and a large number being in strong disagreement.We advertised this event by passing out flyers at the tutoring center and asking professors of biology and chemistry to pass along the information to their students.Elise, Jack, and Harrison spoke to the eager undergraduates and they were also given a chance to ask questions of their own.The presentations went exceptionally well and although initially intimidated by the prospect of presenting for the class, the students excelled in their explanations of complicated genetic concepts and projects.After the student presentations, Dr. Balza presented on Coral biology and Morphology, helping further incorporate this year\u0092s project into the camp along with touring the schools coral reproduction systems and marine life support equipment.We had the undergraduates participate in a survey before the presentation and also after the presentation.The central placement of the responses was expected due to our measured and cautious approach in discussion of this issue and the rising issue of antibiotic resistance.We discussed the various applications of biotechnology along with the implications of our own project on coral and bacteriophages.After lunch we headed into the lab.We started the day with a devotion and light snack, progressing quickly into what turned out to be one of the campers favorite lectures; Biological safety and Warfare with Dr. Henkel.Back at Wisconsin Lutheran College, Dr. Werner walked us through the basics of genetic engineering before we went into the lab once again.The responses received pre-camp to this question showed a large information gap in antibiotic education received prior to camp attendance with a majority of students simply responding with a selection of \u0093I don\u0092t Know\u0094.We began with some review from the day before with a fun jeopardy game.Dr. Henkel took over for the rest of the day and began with the importance of medical microbes.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "We ended the meeting with an icebreaker and organizing team leads for each portion of our project; with lab work planned to begin next week.Lab activities this week consisted of the plasmid isolation of the tolC gene on pUC57 for Salmonella enteric, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholera in order to move to iGEM shipping plasmid pSB1C3.K. pneumonia, and E. coli which was largely worked on by Harrison and Melissa (the first trial had proven unsuccessful because of low DNA concentration).Jack contacted the various speakers for the camp and finalized the times that they would lecture.In the lab a gel electrophoresis protocol was performed by Harrison which determined that the second enzyme digest with the four tolC genes was unsuccessful.We also advertised the Bioengineering Summer Camp on our Facebook page.After a brief break in lab activities, work resumed by looking for bacteriophages that would bind to the TolC protein for S. marcescens.Meanwhile, Elise verified that many of the tolC genes were moved successfully into pTrc99A.The E. coli tolC gene from the previous week was extracted from the gel and a ligation to the pSB1C3 vector was attempted but was unsuccessful.Unfortunately, lab progressed fairly slowly due to our staff dedicating a majority of their time to the summer camp, but no regrets, as our students had a wonderful time.This was the highly anticipated week of the Bioengineering Summer Camp!We transformed these new plasmids into the tolC deletion strain of E. coli.The Biotech Info Night took place this week and Elise, Harrison, and Jack spoke to the 44 students in attendance.A new plasmid isolation was performed with the above tolC genes by Ching Tzu and Theresa Boyadjian with just the tolC genes for K. pneumonia and E. coli.Lab consisted of an enzyme digest using the products of the plasmid isolation from the previous week which was conducted by Harrison and Ching Tzu.The binders were filled with the PowerPoints of all of our lecturers and the lab was stocked with all the materials that would be needed.Summer Camp week!Gel electrophoresis by Harrison confirmed that the E. coli tolC gene was successfully removed from the plasmid.We really wanted to get as much of our wiki completed before Wiki Night to avoid the stress that comes from doing everything at the last minute.Elise and Ching-Tzu performed Western blots to verify our tolC gene expression on both plasmids.The campus cafeteria was also contacted to request lunch boxes for the campers during the day.We held our first meeting this week to get to know one another and to get an idea on the interests of our fellow teammates.The team also decided that we would be holding another Biotechnology Information Night on campus to better educate the new freshman on the various concepts.Additionally, we verified that all of the tolC genes had been successfully moved into the pTrc99A plasmid.We were prepared to welcome our students for a week of bioengineering fun!The week before summer camp was quite hectic.The school cafeteria was also informed on the number of campers and any concern of food allergies.This week was really focused on making sure that everything was prepared for the summer camp.Campers were asked to take the same survey before and after the summer camp to gauge the impact that our camp had on them.Overnight campers began to arrive on Sunday night and the rest of our campers joined us on Monday morning for a jam packed week.We set up a poster to give the new students a better idea of what iGEM really is.This was the first week back to school and the first time that the entire team was able to be together at once.In lab, Elise and Ching-Tzu verified that we successfully moved our three new BioBrick parts into the shipping plasmid!Committees were organized to help make things run more smoothly.The new part that was ordered arrived this week: the tolC gene for Serratia marcescens on pUC57 with the pBAD promoter.This week our wiki design was finalized and various parts of the project were sent to Troy to get uploaded onto our wiki.Additionally, Elise worked on Kirby Bauer assays with the strains that contained tolC genes on pTrc99A.Thursday night was our first meeting and we decided that there would be weekly meetings from now until the Giant Jamboree.Ligation of the E. coli tolC to pSB1C3 followed.Our project was solidified and plans began to form.We needed to put all the survey answers into bar graphs or pie charts.We started the design for our wiki.We also received survey responses from the WELS teachers which were then arranged onto pie charts to be analyzed.New freshman students were welcomed to campus this week.Jack and Harrison set up a table at the campus \u0093Org Smorg\u0094 to recruit for the iGEM team for the following year.We created lectures on viruses/phages and antibiotics.The t-shirt design for the summer camp was agreed upon with the entire team and were then ordered.Kirby Bauer Assays were done a final time with the strains containing all of the tolC genes on pTrc99A .More phage screening was done to attempt to isolate phages.Jack contacted MSOE to guarantee their involvement with the Bioengineering Summer Camp.Another round of camp flyers were sent out to WELS churches.The team discussed the easiest and most efficient ways that this could be advertised throughout campus.Elise and Ching-Tzu started again working on moving our BioBricks into the shipping plasmid.Thus beginning our lab activities for the year as a continuation of last year s project.After this, Harrison ran a gel of the restriction digests and a gel extraction.Restriction enzyme digest followed to remove the part from the plasmid.Read about the blast that we had with our students here.", "protocol": "", "result": "To avoid using any pathogenic strains in lab, we used the tolC genes of the various bacteria in an E. coli deletion strain that lacks the gene.Lane 1 is the pTrc99A plasmid with no tolC gene, lane 2 is E. coli tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid, lane 3 is Klebsiella tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid and lane 4 is Serratia tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid.Figure 2: Western blot Analysis of TolC Protein Production by Plasmid-Encoded tolC Genes on pUC57.The top right plate is our positive control, as it contains the pTrc99A plasmid with the E. coli tolC gene.Once the TolC proteins were confirmed to be produced and functional in the tolC deletion strain of E. coli, we used these strains to screen for bacteriophages.The bottom left plates contain Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumonia tolC genes on the pTrc99A plasmid respectively.Figure 4: Functional Variation in Pathogenic Bacterial TolC Proteins.Western blot analysis of the various strains containing plasmid encoded, pathogenic tolC genes demonstrate the production of the TolC protein (Figures 1 and 2).Alternatively, the genes can be expressed in pTrc99A, a medium copy number plasmid (Gel 1).Because TolC is necessary for antibiotic efflux, the presence of the protein in the outer-membrane increases antibiotic resistance.The Serratia tolC gene allows us to isolate bacteriophages specific to the Serratia TolC protein, which has potential for use in bacteriophage therapy of Elkorn coral, a highly endangered coral.However, our team plans to continue phage screening with these strains, especially the S. marcescens tolC strain: the goal being isolation of a TolC-specific phage that could be used in coral rehabilitation.After cloning the tolC genes into pTrC99A, we transformed the plasmids into a deletion strain of E. coli lacking the chromosomal tolC gene.This is likely because these tolC gene sequences are dramatically different than the E. coli tolC gene.The plasmid-encoded TolC proteins being produced in each strain are decreasing the minimum inhibitory zones (when compared to the strain containing only the plasmid).Previously, the purpose was to isolate bacteriophages that use TolC (an outer membrane protein) of pathogenic bacteria for infection.Reducing the copy number allowed better study of the function of TolC without the overproduction that occurs in a high copy number plasmid.These preliminary results do not show the induction we would expect, however, the protein is being produced.Figure 3: Functional Analysis of TolC Proteins.It is relevant to note that all of these bacteria, including E. coli normally contain the tolC gene, and therefore this gene modification will not result in increasing the pathogenicity of E. coli or causing this laboratory strain to be infectious in any way for humans.Each of the four plates was overlaid with top agar and a culture of E. coli that is lacking the chromosomal tolC gene.The average zones of inhibition in millimeters of multiple trials of Kirby-Bauer Antibiotic assays with standard deviation for both novobiocin and erythromycin is shown for each plasmid-encoded tolC gene.Various pathogenic tolC genes do not all work alike in E. coli.The top left plate demonstrates our negative control as it contains the pTrc99A plasmid with no tolC gene.We also added a new tolC gene, S. marcescens tolC, to our set of tolC genes of pathogenic bacteria.In the Kirby Bauer assays, the zones of inhibition, highlighted with a double headed arrow, demonstrate the minimum inhibitory concentration the antibiotics for each strain (Figure 3).Notably, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholera tolC genes do not appear to function in E. coli.Figure 1:Western blot Analysis of TolC Protein Production by Plasmid-Encoded tolC Genes on pTrc99A.Kirby-Bauer Antibiotic assays can be used to demonstrate functional TolC proteins.Notably, the production can be induced with arabinose when the plasmid with arabinose-inducible promoter is used (Gel 2).We first decided to move the tolC genes of pathogenic bacteria, namely: Escheria coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp.",

gold than the one recovered from 17 tons of gold ore [1].For these reasons we decided to make a project based on a eco-friendly bioleaching technology using two modified bacteria, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Chromobacterium violaceum, for recovering metals from the e-waste.Bioleaching is the process of metal extraction undertaken by microorganisms.We will also test it as a potential selectivity marker for C. violaceum under these alkaline conditions (pH=9.5).After gold is recovered in the third module, we will degrade the remaining cyanide, as it is too toxic to be released to the environment without previous treatment.We will use a different transformant of C. violaceum that will overexpress cyanide hydratase, a cyanide degrading enzyme.It was found that the pH of the original strain had come down to a pH of 0.63, thus all organic material was dissolved despite A. ferrooxidans being an acidophile.With the acid oxidation process used in Module I, metals such as copper, zinc and nickel are solubilized by A. ferrooxidans, but valuable metals like gold and silver are not.(see Modelling)It was transformed successfully with a pretty standard electroporation protocol (Broetto et al, 2005).We were able to transform it using iGEM\u0092s standard PSB1C3 plasmid with a calcium competency protocol for E. coliIn order to improve the efficiency of the process, we will modify C. violaceum using two basic constructs:Though C. violaceum is a native cyanide producer, this basal production is relatively low and regulated by quorum sensing.In a previous study, cyanide production was successfully uncoupled from quorum sensing regulation by transformation with hydrogen cyanide synthase (hcnABC) under pARA regulation (Tay et al, 2013).pGolS is a promoter that has been used previously by other iGEM teams.Pseudomonas fluorescens)It was shown by Pham & Ting (2009) that gold recovery with C. violaceum is more effective than with P. fluorescens as long as the e-waste has been pre-oxidized, as we have designed in Module I.It has already been studied as a bacteria of biotechnological interest because of its adaptability to different stresses.Chief among these characteristics, its resistance to heavy metals and ability to grow using many different carbon sources stand out, as was described by the Brazilian National Genome Project Consortium (2003), the team that first reported sequencing its genome.As it is a native cyanide producer, it is also highly resistant to it (Niven, Collins & Knowles, 1975).It is relatively easy to manage in the lab (similar enough to E. coli as to allow the use of very similar lab protocols)It grows in LB media, with observed population kinetics similar to E. coli.The overexpression of TetH in A. ferrooxidans leads to have a high expression of sulfates in the culture media, with more activity, more protons are released to the media and leads to a greater solubilization of metal ions.Overexpressing a specific gene in an organism, may affect cell\u0092s metabolism and growth rate.Thus, in order to mantain a pH = 9.5, a base has to be continously added to the reactor.Within our construct, the proton pump is regulated by a weak constitutive promoter from the Anderson collection, and the coding sequence is optimized for its expression in C. violaceum.From module I, elemental sulfur is produced due to the metabolism of A. ferrooxidans.We optimized the original sequence for C. violaceum and used this system along with Hydrogen Cyanide Synthase operon hcnABC in order to create a self-regulatory system that activates in the presence of gold, increasing cyanide production and enabling the solubilization of this precious metal as [Au(CN)2]\u0096.Hydrogen cyanide synthase generates HCN, not free CN- ions.In fact, Brown, Turner, and O reilly (1995) reported that a modified E. coli reached 5.5 times the cyanide degrading activity compared to that observed in the native F. lateritium.Broetto, L., Cecagno, R., Sant anna, F. H., Weber, S., & Schrank, I. S. (2005).Science of The Total Environment, 408(2), 183-191. doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.044The first microorganism implemented onto our three step synbio system, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, is a chemoautotrophic bacteria that thrives in very acidic pH (1.5 to 3.0).In the mining industry, it has been established that a pH > 9.4 is ideal (Marsden & House, 2006), as at lower pH values not enough HCN is dissociated; and at higher pH values other factors (such as salinity) become more important.As shown in the modelling section, the overall gold solubilizing reaction generates H+.Thanks to the acidic conditions of A. ferrooxidans Fe(II) is stable and Fe(III) is more soluble than at standard pH (7.0)Phase I: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was obtained from the Geomicrobiology Laboratory of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potos\u00ed, which was isolated from a mine in Durango, Mexico.Due to these alarming problematics, our main motivation for the project is to create a novel synbio system to improve the e-waste recycling technology and make it a feasible approach to reduce the pollutants, and generating a business model with the recycling of these valuable metals.E-waste contains valuable metals as well as potential environmental contaminants.C. violaceum has several characteristics that make it ideal for our project:It is more suited for the project compared to other bacteria that could also be used for cyanide bioleaching.From module I, ions of Fe+2 are produced due to the metabolism of A. ferrooxidans.The composite part BBa_K2055025 uses the T7 system in order to express the enzyme sulfur reductase, which catalyzes the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of elemental sulfur in the presence of oxygen, with sulfite and hydrogen sulfide as products.Figure 3.From Table 1, it can be observed that copper, silver and gold be reduced to a neutral charge spontaneously when coupled with the H2S half-cell.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 100(20), 11660-11665. doi:10.1073/pnas.1832124100 Rin\u00e1gelov\u00e1, A., Kaplan, O., Vesel\u00e1, A.The protocol for the bioleaching experiments consisted in adding 1 g of slag per liter of medium in a flask containing A. ferrooxidans in a set exponential phase.CueR is a transcription factor that stimulates the transcription at the pgolS promoter when bound to copper or gold, as was described by iGEM York 2013.Both mediums were adjusted to a pH of 4.0 and autoclaved at 121 Celsius for 15 min.A first experiment was carried to evaluate the growth of the bacteria in liquid medium with elemental sulfur and sodium thiosulfate.We retrieved this sequence from ferrooxidans\u0092 genome and ran a nucleotide blast to find similitudes with other promoters just as done by the Ribeiro\u0092s article.Inverted operon with a Ferric Uptake Regulator & a LacI coding sequences.It follows that this construct increases its own expression through positive feedback in the presence of gold or copper

coli.The electrical potential difference between the two electrodes can be used as power source to feed a small device or be stored in a battery for its later use.Figure 1.It is commonly used by mining companies for the industrial recovery of metals such as Zn, Ni and Cu from residual dirt and waste materials from their processes.As the pgolS promoter has a basal transcription level, some CueR would be constantly expressed.Group 1 had 10 g/L of elemental sulfur, group 2 had 10 g/L of sodium thiosulfate and group 3 had 5 g/L of elemental sulfur + 5 g/L of sodium thiosulfate.The groups of the experiment consisted in: (1) Control medium without bacteria, (2) Control medium with bacteria without genetic modifications, (3) Bacteria with tetH overexpression.The flasks were incubated for 15 days, taking aliquotes the days 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 to analyze the metal content with ICP-OES, then the data would be compared to the original ewaste and the metals solubilized were calculated.After being washed three times with distilled water, the solid residues of the bioleach treatment or the acid medium treatment were transferred to the Chromobacterium violaceum alkaline bioleaching phase of our MetalEca process.A.When iron is in a sufficient concentration, it makes a complex with the FUR protein which then binds to the FURBOX inhibiting LacI transcription, activating the pLac promoter and the transcription TeTH sequence for protein synthesis.The characterization of the part would be done using an RFP coding sequence, instead of the production of TetH.As a result, most of the electronic waste is dumped in landfills where it is burned with other wastes generating dioxins, hydrogen chloride and other compounds that directly affect the environment.It was expected that the curve of the group 3 had the biggest slope value.Unfortunately three weeks after our first inoculum we lost our strain due to a failure in the pH measurements, when we tried to inoculate them again to fresh media cells would not grow.The solubilised metals are going to be then used in the galvanic cell, but they will have to reduced or oxidised first.Figure 2.Sulfur reductase is used to catalyze the reduction of elemental sulfur in the presence of oxygen, with sulfite and hydrogen sulfide as products.Metals recovered with Chromobacterium violaceum.The solubilised metals are going to be then used in the reduction half-cell.TetH is involved in the electron transfer for A. ferrooxidans.[4] Monterrey is the leading city with a high concentration of PM10 particles among Latin American countries.It is estimated that industrial activities and \u0093primitive\u0094 e-waste recycling techniques are among the main factors for the release of these type of particles into the atmosphere [3].Expression of the cyanide hydratase enzyme from Fusarium lateritium in Escherichia coli and identification of an essential cysteine residue.The reaction increases the acidity of the media and releases sulfates, which chelate metals.For the bioleaching process, e-waste was washed three times with distilled water to diminish the natural basic pH of the metals.In a galvanic cell, the element with the higher (or more positive) reduction potential gets reduced and the one with the lower (or more negative) reduction potential gets oxidized.To solve this problem, we will use two control mechanism to inhibit gene expression when not needed: a temperature induced promoter (HSP) and an iron induced inverted operon (FUR/FURBOX).Heat Shock Promoter is a ?32-dependent promoter for for the Afe_1437 gene in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Ribeiro, D. A.,2011).BLAST analysis revealed that the translated golS protein included in the part submitted by York 2013 has a 100% homology with CueR from Salmonella typhimurium.The metropolitan area is considered as the most polluted in Latin America in terms of air quality [2].First, without the presence of iron, the lactose inhibits the pLac promoter.One of the main reasons is the high concentration of PM10 in the atmosphere, particles so small that they are able to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause a wide variety of pulmonary and heart diseases, leading to a premature death.For further information on these control mechanisms and the rest of our parts, please go to the Parts section of our wiki.Although iron is the most abundant transition metal on Earth, its solubility is very low at neutral pH in aerobic environments.In the case of nickel and zinc, they can\u0092t be reduced by sulfur oxidation, they needs to be recovered by using an electric current or in another cell arrangement.In the left side, the oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur occurs.However, the recovery of these last two metals is vital in making the process economically viable, due to their high market value and relative scarcity.[2]The main benefit of using recycled metals over their virgin materials is the significant energy saved, almost 95%!This promoter is induced by gold, through the binding of transcriptional activator GolS with gold, which later binds to the recognition site of the promoter allowing for higher expression of genes in the presence of gold.Using the reduction potentials of the metallic ions in the solutions, we established a spontaneous reaction by coupling them with the oxidation of S2- from H2S into S0.Thus, our construct is constituted by the pgolS promoter and the coding sequence of CueR.In the right side, the reductions occur and the recovery of metals occur.\u00c7olak, D., et al.Since free CN- ions are responsible for the reaction that solubilizes gold, we must take into account the dissociation of HCN.Also the expression of the desired gene will tend to decrease over time.The reaction that takes place is illustrated in the following figure:Figure 1.The agar medium was made with the same concentrations, only 12.5 g/L was added.Journal of General Microbiology,90(2), 271-285. doi:10.1099/00221287-90-2-271Tay, S. B., Natarajan, G., Rahim, M. N., Tan, H. T., Chung, M. C., Ting, Y. P., & Yew, W. S. (2013).Its mechanism underlies on the transformation of solid metal compounds into soluble products that can be easily extracted and recovered, due to the catabolism of microorganisms.An effective way to solubilize them is by bioleaching with a cyanide-producing organism such as C. violaceum.Monterrey is one of the leading industrialized cities in Mexico, but this growth has led to many environmental and health issues.The enzyme tetrathionate hydrolase (TetH), which is produced inside the bacteria and then taken out to the external matrix, constantly converts tetrathionate to two molecules: thiosulfate and elemental sulfur.We added bromocresol green (0.5% V/V) on the petri dishes in order to identify the colonies and calculate the colony-forming unit of each experimental group.Tetrathionate is a key intermediate during RISC oxidation, hydrolyzed by tetrathionate hydrolase (TetH), and used as sole energy source.http://www.cleanairinstitute.org/calidaddelaireamericalatina/cai-report-english.pdfGangwar, C., Singh, A., Kumar, A., Chaudhry, A. K., & Tripathi, A.Ferrooxidans is an acidophilic bacteria that turns its own culture media into a more acidic environment to satisfy its growing conditions.Iron oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, giving it a big enough reduction potential for its reduction to happen spontaneously.", "design": "", "human_practice": "Later CVR agreed to provide us with the shredded e-waste for our project.After this, we involved our community in different events aimed to create consciousness about e-waste pollution and the dreadful consequences of incorrect e-waste disposal.Meeting with CVR, one of the few certified e-waste recycling companies in Mexico.This aspect is reflected in our numerous events, evidence we saw on the enormous pile of e-waste we collected during four days, weighing almost a ton!We knew that informing our community about the issues we face every day and how synthetic biology is a powerful tool able to fix them wouldn\u0092t be enough.We also wanted to inform as much people as we could about the different ways in which they could participate and come up with solutions to help us improve our current situation.We sent this huge amount of e-waste to CVR, a certified recycling company, where it could be treated correctly.Throughout this process, our experience allowed us to evaluate and reshape our project according to society\u0092s needs.", "modeling": "This time, however, there is no basal expression and the degradation constant is the same, so we only expand upon equation eqref{eq:ECell} adding the production rate modeled by the Hill equation with Hill coefficient (n = 1): frac{dE_{Cell}}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}} + frac{gamma AuCN_{in}}{K_{E} + AuCN_{in}} - delta_{E}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} + k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} It should be noted that the overexpression of HCN synthase is activated after the regular expression regulated by quorum sensing as it depends on the detection of dicyanoaurate(I) ion.We will use the following parameters in the development of the model:Diffusion parameter for the autoinducer outside the cellConcentration of CviR-AHL complex (2 AHL and 2 CviR molecules)Rate constant for AHL production due to CviI concentrationRate constant for the formation of CviR-AHL complexRate constant for the dissociation of the CviR-AHL complexRate of AHL diffusion across the membrane for each

production parameter due to bound (\text{Au}pars{\text{CN}}_2^{-}) to the promoter(\text{Au}pars{\text{CN}}_2^{-}) concentration occupying half of the binding sites We start by proposing a model for the population growth.So we re-write equation eqref{eq:EMemb} and write the kinetic equations for (G), (C_1), (C_2), (Ac), (HCN) and (AcH_2): frac{dE_{Memb}}{dt} = -k_{EC}E_{Memb}G + k_{CP}C_{2}+k_{CE}C_{1} + k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell}-k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} These equations describe the HCN production by following the intermediate steps where the enzyme binds to glycine and the acceptors.Initially, the solution will contain (Fe^{+2}) that will be diffused through the cell membrane according to Fick s first law of diffusion: This iron will combine with the protein Fur to form a complex which we will call (C_{1}) according to the reaction: F_{in} + Fur overset{k_{FC}}{underset{k_{CF}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{1} frac{dF_{in}}{dt} = k_{FC}FurF_{in} + k_{CF}C_{1} The complex (C_{1}) will act as an inhibitor to the expression of the proteins Fur and LacI, so their expression rates will be: frac{dFur}{dt} = alpha_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{C_{1}}{K_{1}}} - delta_{Fur}Fur frac{dLacI}{dt} = alpha_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{C_{1}}{K_{1}}} - delta_{LacI}LacI LacI also acts as an inhibitor to the expression of the enzyme Tetrathionate hydrolase.Taking into account the basal production in the absence of CviR-AHL and the degradation of (E), we get: frac{dE}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}}-delta_{E}E The enzyme then proceeds to insert itself into the membrane where it is active and can produce HCN.So, the expression of TetH is given by: frac{dTetH}{dt} = \beta_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{LacI}{K_{2}}} - delta_{TetH}TetH Figure 1: As Fur-Fe(^{2+}) complex appears, it inhibits LacI production and the existing LacI degradates.It is known that the reaction for TetH is given by: TetH + S overset{k_{TC}}{underset{k_{CT}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{2} overset{k_{CS}}{\rightarrow} SO_{4}^{-2} + S_{2}O_{3}^{-2} + 2:H^{+} + TetH dfrac{dTetH}{dt} = -k_{TC}(TetH)(S) + k_{CT}C_{2} + k_{CS}C_{2} frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = k_{TC}(TetH)(S) - k_{CT}C_{2} - k_{CS}C_{2} Notice that the pH of the solution will diminish because of the production of (H^{+}) by TetH.The chemical-like reaction of insertion (and withdraw) would be the following: Therefore the equations that describe HCN synthase (before its overexpression) would be: frac{dE_{Memb}}{dt} = k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} frac{dE_{Cell}}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}} - delta_{E}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} + k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} We proceed to analyze the production of HCN using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics.Because the degradation of mRNA molecules occurs much faster than the degradation of proteins, the system quickly falls in a quasi-steady-state where (frac{dm}{dt}=0) and the concentration of m at that time is: Substituting back in the equation for (\rho(t)) we have: where (alpha=frac{k_{1}k_{0}}{delta_{m}}) is the constant expression rate.The equations that describe this transitions are: E_{Memb} + G &overset{k_{EC}}{underset{k_{CE}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{1}\\ C_{1} + 2: Ac &overset{k_{CC_1}}{underset{k_{CC_2}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{2}\\ C_{2} overset{k_{CP}}{\rightarrow} HCN +&: CO_{2} + 2: AcH_2 Figure 5: This graph shows the consumption of glycine and the acceptor taking into account all the equations described in this model (i.e.Writing the chemical kinetics following the law of mass action, we get: frac{dR^{ast}}{dt} = k_{QS_1}A^2pars{R_T-2R^{ast}}^2 - k_{QS_2}R^{ast} To describe the transcription from DNA to a product protein we can use the equations (Ingalls, 2012): frac{dm}{dt}=k_{0} - delta_{m}m(t), qquad frac{d\rho}{dt}=k_{1}m(t) - delta_{\rho}\rho(t), where (m) and (\rho) represent the concentration of mRNA molecules and product protein, (delta_m) and (delta_\rho) represent their degradation constants, (k_0) is the transcription rate from DNA to mRNA and (k_1) is the transcription rate from mRNA to (\rho).Adding the production of (HCN) and its reaction with gold, we get: frac{dHCN}{dt} = 8pars{-k_{fAuCN}HCN^{8}Au^{4} + k_{rAuCN}AuCN_{out}^4}Au^{2/3} + k_{CP}C_2 Figure 7: Following our approximation of gold cyanidation, this graph shows the dissolution of gold pebbles by HCN produced by C. violaceum.It should be noted that C. violaceum produces HCN, whose dissociation equation is: To simplify the process we combine both reactions to obtain: 4: Au + 8: HCN + O_{2} overset{k_{fAuCN}}{underset{k_{rAuCN}}{\rightleftharpoons}} 4: Au(CN)_{2}^{-} + 2: H_{2}O + 4: H^{+} It is important to note that the combination of these equations may create some deviations against the real cyanidation process.Writing the equation for (A) will give us: frac{dA}{dt} = -2k_{QS_1}A^2(R_{T} - 2R^{ast})^2 + 2k_{QS_2}R^{ast} + k_{QS_0}I-r_{QS}(A-A_{ext}) We also include an expression for (A_{ext}) considering diffusion through the cell.We will assume that the more TetH is produced, the more Copper will be dissolved according to the reaction: Cu + Fe_{2}(SO_{4})^{-2}_{3},\rightleftharpoons, Cu^{+2} + 2:Fe^{+2} + 3:SO_{4}^{-2} The amount of dissolved (Fe^{+2}) in the medium will also increase.A glycine molecule binds to a HCN synthase in the membrane, forming a complex (C_1).We then use simple kinetics to model the reaction as if it were homoge- neous but with a simple modification: frac{dAu}{dt}=4pars{-k_{fAuCN}HCN^{8}Au^{4} + k_{rAuCN} AuCN_{out}^4}Au^{2/3} As noted in the equations above, a (Au^{2/3}) term was added.Figure 4: Following the population growth model from Figure (3) and the equations described in this section, we obtained a model for the concentration of CviI, which shows the steep switch-like activation of the quorum sensing mechanism.The reaction that occurs between the unbound CviR and AHL can be expressed as follows: If we consider that the total amount of CviR is fixed, the amount of unbound CviR can be given by (R = R_T \u0096 2 R^{ast}), this is evident from the previous equation because two CviR monomers are needed in order to create a CviR-AHL complex.We will use the following parameters in the development of the model:Average concentration of (Fe^{2+}) inside A. ferroxidansAverage concentration of (Fe^{2+}) outside A. ferroxidansRate of (Fe^{2+}) diffusion across the membrane for each cellAverage concentration of Fur complexed with (Fe^{2+})Rate constant for the dissociation of (C_1) complexBasal expression of the cassette (coding for Fur and LacI)(C_1) concentration occupying half of the binding sitesLacI concentration occupying half of the binding sitesRate constant for the dissociation of (C_2) complexRate constant for the formation of the products of (C_2) We will not consider the reactions going on outside the cell in order to simplify the model.It is also produced linearly by CviI and we need to take into account that the degradation of (R^{ast}) liberates 2 molecules of (A).Following Fick\u0092s Law of diffusion we get: With this description of the diffusion of the ion, we can model the over-expression of HCN synthase as we have previously done so with CviI and HCN synthase in equations eqref{eq:I} and eqref{eq:E0}.The promoter that encodes for this enzyme is regulated by a quorum sensing mechanism: a process through which bacteria sense the population density in their close surroundings with the help of the autoinducer (signaling molecule) N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL).Hydrogen cyanide produced by C. violaceum is generated by the enzyme HCN synthase, whose expression is regulated by quorum sensing.As (A) is going to be diffused through the cell membrane, we apply Fick\u0092s Law of diffusion.The chemical equation describing gold cyanidation is: 4: Au + 8: CN^{-} + O_{2} + 2: H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons 4: Au(CN)_{2}^{-} + 4: OH For the kinetics of the reaction we will consider O(_2) concentration as constant due to the fact that oxygen can be constantly supplied to the reactor tank and small variations have little effect on the reaction speed.A term is added for concentrations that diffuse far away from the cell population and don\u0092t contribute to the reaction: Equations eqref{eq:CviI}, eqref{eq:I}, eqref{eq:A}, eqref{eq:Aext}, along with the population growth equation eqref{eq:P}, describe the process know as quorum sensing.This happens because A. ferrooxidans obtains its energy by oxidizing (Fe^{2+}) to (Fe^{3+}) and producing (SO_{4}^{2-}) during a process of electron exchange in the membrane.In order to increase HCN production with the objective of dissolving gold, a genetic modification to overexpress HCN synthase is proposed.One of the modifications made to C. violaceum is the addition of a cassette that overexpresses HCN synthase.Because CviI is part of an autoregulated gene circuit with positive feedback and (R^{ast}) acting as a promoter, then the transcription of CviI can be expressed as: frac{dI}{dt}=a_0 + frac{aR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}}-delta_{I}I Here (alphaequiv a_0) for the basal production and (alphaequiv a) for the production where (R^{ast}) promotes the transcription.Although the time scale given is accurate for the population, this only shows the expected behavior as the rates of HCN production and gold cyanidation are unknown.Assuming perfect spheres of solid gold with an average diameter, we concluded that the proportion of superficial area to the amount of undissolved gold would be ([Au]^{2/3}).We will work with a constant pH of 9 (pH inside the reactor tank can be measured and controlled by a device that liberates a base into the solution, this came from previous simulations where there were significant pH changes; equation eqref{eq:mergeAuCyan} has protons as a product, this also suggested the team to work with a proton pump).Because the focus of this mathematical model is to describe the bio-bricks and gold cyanidation is a very complex field of study, the latter is beyond our scope and so we will take a simplified approach.We propose a behavior similar to the law of mass action on the basis that the probability of the insertion into the membrane will depend on the amount of (E) in the cell and that it should reach an equilibrium where the membrane gets to a saturated status for that specific amount of (E).It demonstrates a clear dependence on both glycine and the acceptor for HCN production: as long as there is a healthy population, there will be a production of HCN given that there are enough resources.Studies have found that a number of phenotypic characteristics in C. violaceum such as the production of violacein, hydrogen cyanide, antibiotics and exoproteases are regulated by the endogenous N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone through the process of quorum sensing.As this enzyme is encoded in the same cassette where CviI is encoded, it is also regulated by CviR-AHL and so the production rate of can be modeled in the same way.For this we add the population term (p) because each cell is going to be producing the molecule and contributing to the extracellular space.We will also consider the same population model we used for Chromobacterium violaceum in the section below.Figure 8: An increased slope clearly shows the effect of the overexpression of HCN synthase.For this reason, it is important that we take into consideration the diffusion of the ion across the membrane.Because of this, there will be some enzymes inside the cell and others will be in the membrane.Equation eqref{eq:AcH2} describes the concentration of reduced acceptors, however it can be ignored in the simulation as it is a final byproduct.In C. violaceum the quorum sensing mechanism also produces an enzyme called HCN synthase, which we will call (E).We will use the quorum sensing model for Vibrio fischeri due to the similarities with the chemical species present in C. violaceum.In the process of bioleaching A. ferrooxidans can be considered a clean alternative because it does not produce toxic residues.Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a bacterium who usually lives in very acid environments (1.5-2 pH), it can be found mostly in acid mine drainage, and have the amazing property of being able to convert insoluble metals to their soluble state.For the regulation of the mechanism, a promoter inducible by dicyanoaurate(I) ion is used.The derivation of the Michaelis-Menten equation requires that the amount of synthase remains constant but this is not the case.Figure 3: Experimental data and fitted growth model of C. violaceum with growth rate constant (r = 0.0156\text{ min}^{-1}) and carrying capacity (K_P = 1.3344) OD(_{600}).C.To increase the efficiency of the process our team proposed a mechanism in which Tetrathionate Hydrolase (TetH) is produced.However, we expect population to show the following behavior: where (P_0) is the initial concentration: (P(0) = P_0).This way, overexpression will only happen in the presence of gold.Since there shouldn\u0092t be any threats to the population during the project\u0092s processes and the medium will be kept well nourished within the time it involves, it can be assumed that the population will grow until it reaches an equilibrium in the medium because of the limited carrying capacity.The differential equation that describes this behavior is: where (P) is the total C. violaceum concentration at a given moment, (r) is the growth rate and (K_P) is the carrying capacity.Its mechanism is extremely complicated due to the fact that it involves interactions between liquids and solids, it\u0092s an heterogeneous reaction.Figure 6: This graph shows HCN synthase inside C. violaceum and in its membrane (in arbitrary units).However, as we have stated, cyanidation is not our main focus and we have found this to considerably simplify our simulations of the model while maintaining the rest of the processes intact.Figure 2: As LacI concentration goes down, the expression of TetH is allowed.Chromobacterium violaceum is defined as a saprophyte bacteria, which is normally considered to be nonpathogenic for humans, and it is found in soil and water samples of tropical and sub-tropical areas of several continents.The promoter for this cassette is activated by the presence of the dicyanoaurate(I) ion.(2009) The Chemistry of Gold Extraction.The reverse reaction of the dissolution inside the cells can be dismissed because of the lack of nucleation sites.This was derived from the consideration that the reaction speed depends upon the superficial area of solid gold.A limit is reached when there are no resources left for the enzyme to catalyze the production (i.e.Using a regression algorithm we obtained the growth rate constant (r) and the carrying capacity constant (K_P) resulting in a value of (\text{R}^2 = 0.9956).This equation will be solved numerically along with the ones presented in the following sections to facilitate their coupled solution.It was firstly observed during the second half of the XIX century and it was named after its violet coloration, which is given by violacein.We took into account an approximation of OD(_{600}) to number of cells (p=P\times10^8) ((P) being the population density in OD(_{600}) and described by equation eqref{eq:P}).To get a better insight of the behavior of our descriptions, we simulate the processes in Matlab\u00ae.Gold cyanidation is a complex process in which solid particles of gold are transformed into dicyanoaurate(I) ion (Au(CN)^?_2) in the presence of cyanide.", "notebook": "Also, transformations were made of RFP (20F) in E.

the advantages of introducing a new chassis to iGEM that can be transformed using the standard plasmid.Characterization of BBa_R0010 in Chromobacterium violaceumWe characterized the promoter BBa_R0010 in a novel chassis, C. violaceum.We measured the composition of the slag with the technique Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Juan Jos\u00e9 Cort\u00e9s helped us with the procedure and we obtained these results.The weight of the dry slag after the digestion was 0.327 grams, therefore, the total grams of metal per gram of slag must be of 0.673, there are 0.0219 grams of metals left to calculate the composition so we asked Julio Rivera to conduct an ICP-OES to calculate them and we obtained these results.Therefore for our model, we know what is the maximum solubilization of metals.Heat shock transformation of Chromobacterium violaceum with the RFP-generator (BBa_J04450)We successfully transformed a novel chassis, Chromobacterium violaceum.There were no significant difference in the fluorescence of the between the induced and uninduced groups of C. violaceum, whereas in E. coli it showed normal induction and a clear difference of RFP expression when the inductor was added to the bacteria.We also showed that the part BBa_J04450 can be used as a reporter gene in a novel chassis, Chromobacterium violaceum.This part is a proton pump generator that is regulated by a weak constitutive promoter from the Anderson collection.However, in previous experiments we noticed that one of these two constructs actually reduced the viability of the bacteria, thus we determined it was not a reliable control group for our experiment.We adapted standardized E. coli protocols for calcium competency and heat shock transformation, successfully transforming C. violaceum.As seen in the figure, we tried preparing the calcium competent cells at different optical densities and transformed using different durations of heat shock.We transformed BL21 E. coli with three different constructs, one coding for the proton pump, and, as control groups, two constructs that consisted of the same plasmid as our proton pump (pUC-IDT, which has ampicillin resistance), but without the actual coding sequence for the proton pump.CueR is a transcription factor that stimulates the transcription at the pgolS promoter when bound to copper or gold, as was described by the iGEM York 2013.We calculated an average of the three replicates for each transformed strain and graphed the data in order to determine if the proton pump had a significant effect on the survivability of the bacteria.Thus, this construct increases its own expression through positive feedback in the presence of gold or copper through the production of a copper/gold sensitive protein.As the pgolS promoter has a basal transcription level, some CueR would be constantly expressed.Nevertheless, a basal activity for the fluorescence was found in the following graphWe used 2 different concentrations of copper as well as 4 different compositions of the shredded e-waste that CVR provided.Although transformation using an electroporation protocol had been described before, there was no previous report of a heat shock transformation of C. violaceum.The strain transformed with the proton pump had an exponential growth phase, while the others couldn\u0092t resist the alkaline pH and had minimal growth.Additionally, we used the RFP-generator (BBa_J04450) in pSB1C3 in the transformation.This modification to bacterial cell membrane may increase stress resistance under alkaline conditions.Characterization of the golS promoter in Chromobacterium violaceumWe submitted a new part: BBa_K2055369.Our conclusion is that the promoter BBa_R0010 can be used as a constitutive promoter in C. violaceum.BBa_R0010 is lacI regulated, however, we were unable to confirm whether or not C. violaceum produces lacI natively through a literature search, and BLAST analysis of its genome suggested that it does not have this regulating system.This was necessary because, as C. violaceum produces a native purple pigment (violacein), we were curious as to whether RFP would be useful as a reporter gene.In C.Violaceum, this part expressing the RFP, did not presented an inducible activity in the e-waste copper and gold compositions that Tec-Monterrey 2016 worked with.", "safety": "",

(B) Standing for the adsorbed mercury ions.(B) The effective adsorption rate of Hg2+ by engineered E. coli.Additionally, the presence of engineered E. coli did not affect fish growth.To examine the specificity of the biosensor, the fluorescence responses of GFP-MC toward various metal ions, including Cd2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Mo6+, Ni2+, Hg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Ag+, Zn2+, and Cu2+, were studied under the same conditions.After MC binding of Hg2+ on the surface, the fluorescence emission of GFP-MC is quenched.Figure 10: (A) Rarefaction analysis of the different fish.An energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system was used to verify the cells and it verifies that the black spots were the MC accumulated Hg2+ (Figure 8-C).The results showed that the mercury ions were adsorbed on GFP-MC protein-displayed cells by surface display system.With the increase in the concentration of Hg2+ from 0 to 100 ?M, fluorescence of GFP-MC decreased continually.This strategy was adopted for targeting the GFP-MC to the surface of E. coli.(C) EDXA measurement of the box from (D) The control TEM images of E. coli BL21.Mercury content in the Control 1 fish decreased by 62.5% compared to Control 2.As shown in Figure 8 (A) the GFP-MC was on the cell surface and was approximately 500 nm in size.Ice nucleation protein (INP) is an extrinsic membrane protein; since the truncated version of INP only contains the N-terminal domain, which is the anchor membrane and GFP-MC, the fusion protein was displayed on the surface of E. coli, without any adverse effects on cell growth and integrity.Moreover, the coexistence of other metal ions showed no obvious interference in Hg2+ assays (Figure 4-B).The concentration of mercury in the fish of Control group 1 was 0.49 \u00b5g/g, while that in control group 2 was 1.664 \u00b5g/g and in the experimental group, it was 0.623 \u00b5g/g.Figure 4:(A) Selectivity of the IC sensing system.Figure 2: (A) Fluorescence images of engineering E. coli cells.A protein band of 43 kDa, corresponding to the correct size of INP-N-GFP-MC, was detected from cells containing recombinant plasmid (Figure 1, lane 7).The calibration curve of the concentration dependence of Cu2+ showed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9846) in the concentration ranging from 0 to 20 uM (Figure 5 A-B).An outer membrane protein INP-N was fused to the GFP-MC gene, creating an INP-GFP-MC which was designated pET23b/INP-GFP-MC (Figure 1-A).The fluorescence emission spectra of GFP-MC with different Hg2+ is shown in Figure 3 (a).From the Hg2+ concentration-dependent calibration curve, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9803) in the concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 ?M was obtained (Fig.In this display system, the MC can bind mercury to iron through immobilization on the surface of cells.Comparatively, the fluorescence quenching induced by Hg2+ is weaker than Cu2+.Figure 5:(A) Fluorescence spectra of IC (OD600 = 1.3) in the presence of Cu2+ with varying concentrations.This result shows that the MC has been displayed on the cell surface of E. coli, using ice nucleation protein as an anchoring motif.Figure 6:(A) Fluorescence spectra of IC (OD600 = 1.3) in the presence of Cd2+ with varying concentrations.Thus, GFP-MC can be used for the detection of lower concentrations of Cd2+.The LMR11 samples were closely related to the LMR12 samples, whereas the LMR9 and LMR10 samples were distant from the other samples along PCoA2, which represented 24.29% of the total variations (Figure 10-B).Thus, the engineered strain can be used as a feed additive agent to alleviate heavy metal contamination of fish.In the experimental group, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were increased, compared to Control 2, while Fusobacteria and Tenericutes decreased.Fish growth was significantly influenced by the presence of 0.1 mg/l Hg2+.From the Cd2+ concentration-dependent calibration curve, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9977) in concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 ?M was obtained (Fig.In conclusion, it is important that the fodder containing the engineered strain does not affect normal growth when fed to fish.Figure 7: (A) The adsorption of Hg2+ by E. coli harboring the recombinant\u00a0plasmid.The results show that the MC exhibits its mercury binding characteristics when it is displayed on the surface.This indicated that the MC can bind mercury effectively.Compared with MT displayed on the cell surface, the binding efficiency of IC is higher than MT.(C) Fluorescence titration of IC (OD = 1.3) and Cu2+ (50 \u00b5M) following the addition of different concentrations of S2- (0-50 \u00b5M).The addition of Hg2+ (100 ?M) induced a significant decline in fluorescence emission of GFP-MC, which indicated that GFP-MC can be used as a sensor for Hg2+ detection.Furthermore, these engineered E. coli cells selectively adsorbed mercury ions from LB medium containing various heavy metals separately or mixed together.To verify the surface localization of the GFP-MC protein by cell fractionation, INP-N-GFP-MC in the membrane fraction was also demonstrated by western blotting.Thirteen different phyla were identified from the 6 samples.Excitation wavelength: 488 nm (D) Fluorescence titration of IC (OD) and Cu2+ (50 \u00b5M) following the addition of different concentrations of EDTA (0-20 \u00b5M).However, it can be seen that only Cd2+ increased the fluorescence of GFP-MC (Figure 6-A).The final concentration of the ions was 50 ?M.The black bars represent the addition of an excess of the appropriate metal ion (50 \u00b5M) to a bacterial solution.A total of 15,480 reads per sample and 1,306 OTUs were obtained from the 6 samples through Illumina Miseq system for sequencing.Good\u0092s coverage estimations revealed that 94% to 98% of the species were obtained in all of the samples.3-B), and the lowest detection limit was less than 1 \u00b5M.In comparison, engineered E. coli significantly protected fish from mercury toxicity.In comparison, engineered E. coli significantly protected fish from mercury toxicity.The principal coordinate analysis?PcoA?score plot revealed the bacterial communities of the samples.(B) Fluorescence responses of IC to Hg2+ at varying concentrations.Overall, the two PCoA axes explained 88.31% of the variation between the different communities.Although cells carrying pET23bNot were not fluorescent (Figure 2-B), cells carrying pET23b/INP-N-GFP-MC were brightly labeled fluorescent cells; Figure 2-A displays the fluorescence emission spectra of GFP-MC.", "safety": "To reduce the risks

body metabolizes lead and processes it.Unfortunately, this means that the child will continue to have prolonged exposure to lead at a very low level.With all the important information put into the model, we were able to begin simulating lead exposure.To examine the effect of severity of exposure over the same period of time, we ran simulations of a 100 day exposure to different levels of contamination range including 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppb.The results of these simulations are below It s clear that while the blood lead levels spike quickly, the body is able to filter the lead out of its system within 3 or 4 months after the initial exposure.This model provides a quantified approach relating the level and duration of lead exposure with the concentration of lead in the blood.You should note that as the duration of exposure increases, so does the variation in blood lead level, meaning that the severity for the same level of contamination will be more of a range than one distinct value.The Effect of Lead Contamination in Drinking Water on a Young Population  In developing a lead sensor for our project, we were curious about the effects of lead contamination in the water supply on small children.We were pretty appalled by the devastating effects lead can have on the human body and how long it can persist even after the initial exposure.Whether it is in estimating the severity of the events in Flint, Michigan or in detecting the threshold of exposure without noticeable side effects, this model could be the first step in better realizing how our bodies take up, store and slowly get rid of lead.With these literature values, we were able to create a rudimentary mass balance of the human body focusing on the amount of lead ingested and the amount that is excreted.The results of these simulations are shown below  Here we can see that even though the increase in lead in the bones is linear with time, the concentration of lead in the blood appears to begin reaching a saturation point.We began with a thorough examination of the literature, looking for important details on how much lead is absorbed into the body, where the absorbed lead goes, and how long it stays in the body.To account for the different amounts of water a child may drink in a given day, we ran the simulation 50 times and plotted them all on the same graph.Blood-lead levels do reach different levels of saturation but now we see that the rate at which lead is absorbed by the bones increases with contamination severity.Initially, we used a pulse of lead contamination of 50 ppb for 10 days on a 1-year-old child.This gave us a range of possible blood lead level concentrations based off of the level of lead contamination as we will see later.Determining the blood volume was a little tricky.We decided to look at the same level of exposure (50 ppb) but for increasing intervals of time (ranging from the initial 10 days and increasing to 25, 50 and 100 days of exposure.To get a better look at just the blood concentrations, below is a zoomed-in portion of the same graph just focussing on blood-lead levels for the first 200 days.As of yet there is no hard evidence that proves such a long exposure to lead at a low level can do any damage, there is a growing notion that an exposure like this at such a young age can make the individual at higher risk for depression and other neurological conditions.This is not true for the bones because the lead that makes it into the bones stays around much longer.We were able to find the average water consumed by a child based on their age in order to get an idea of their lead intake.This was meant to simulate a brief exposure to a mild amount of lead.We decided to model it using a 500 day window to see the long-term effects of lead exposure.", "notebook": "For a list of our protocols, visit the Protocols page.Test cell-free extract reaction with T7-GFP plasmidContact museums and summer programs for

for the Hairpin versus Duplex experiment above, the duplex and folded hairpin do not activate the toehold switch because the trigger is hybridized to the catalytic strand.Results from sequencing in Week 11 suggest that our completed construct contains CFP instead of amilCP, although the construct contains both the pT7-RBS and terminator.The final concentration of DNAzyme in the reactions is 3.74 nM, and the final concentration of lead is 2 \u00b5M.As shown below with data from Week 5, the plasmid triggers activate the toehold switch with as little as 10 ng of plasmid in a 25-?L reaction.However, a comparison by concentration of DNA instead of mass would be more accurate because the plasmid has much more \"extra\" DNA than the linear form.In Week 6, we ran cell-free reactions over a range of volumes.However, the duplex did not activate the toehold switch.We started working with the lead hairpin DNAzyme in Week 13.In Week 6, we found that the DNA trigger also activated the toehold switch at concentrations as low as 1 pM.In cell-free extract, the lead hairpin DNAzyme produces higher activation of the toehold switch than the duplex DNAzyme in a 1:1000 ratio.Below, the LacZ expression produced by the toehold switch activated by the hairpin DNAzyme cleavage product is compared to the LacZ expression in a system without lead.This could be a result of the excess catalytic strand interfering with the other processes occurring in the reaction.Although the dPAGE assays we performed in Weeks 7 to 10 do not provide clear information, the cell-free reactions suggest that the DNAzyme does cleave its substrate.Since we do not have a LacZ we can use, we have not started construction of this second part of the amplifier.The time course data shown below is more a function of evaporation than reaction progress; the liquid evaporated over the course of the run.We analyzed the efficiency of sequestration in Week 11.As shown in the figure below, there was still a signal with a reaction volume of 5 ?L.In addition, the triggers are switch-specific--the trigger for the D switch does not activate the G switch.However, after leaving them in the incubator overnight, the reactions darkened in color.For more details about our daily activities and experiments, visit our Notebook.In Week 8, we found that linear DNA does not perform better than plasmid DNA in PURExpress.The gel below suggests that all of the substrate strand is sequestered, but the thickness of the catalytic strand s band as the ratio increases could be blocking the signal from the

environment from waste water treatment plants annually [2].As for the effect of AR on human health, some researches has suggested that it could lead to obesity [3], Some antibiotics can lead to toxic damage, allergic reaction, carcinogenic effect, mutagenic effect, etc.So we decided to focus on the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics residues.[4]Zhang, Q.-Q., Ying, G.-G., Pan, C.-G., Liu, Y.-S. & Zhao, J.-L. Comprehensive Evaluation of Antibiotics Emission and Fate in the River Basins of China: Source Analysis, Multimedia Modeling, and Linkage to Bacterial Resistance.[2] Zhang, Q.-Q., Ying, G.-G., Pan, C.-G., Liu, Y.-S. & Zhao, J.-L. Comprehensive Evaluation of Antibiotics Emission and Fate in the River Basins of China: Source Analysis, Multimedia Modeling, and Linkage to Bacterial Resistance.Among all kinds of antibiotics, tetracycline is one of the most produced and used.One of the most serious damage tetracycline antibiotics have exerted on human beings is the tetracycline pigmentation teeth, which is rather prevalent in China.During the course of paper research, we found tetracycline antibiotics is one type of the most abundant antibiotics found in urban rivers, as illustrated in the table below [5].Occurrence and behavior of antibiotics in water and sediments from the Huangpu River, Shanghai, China.Our team is determined to work on the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics in our surroundings.The concentrations of the target antibiotics in (a) water samples and (b) sediment samples from the Huangpu River, Shanghai, China in July 2012 [5].Stunned by the large amount of antibiotic residues in Chinese urban rivers [4], UCAS iGEM team is devoted to degrading antibiotic residues in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) or hospitals.And that is why it is one of the most resistant antibiotics.Nowadays, tetracycline antibiotic residues mostly come from the overuse in animal husbandry and aquaculture industry.Tetracycline antibiotics are protein synthesis and cell growth inhibitors, inhibiting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex.However, the relatively low price of antibiotics has also led to its misuse, especially in developing countries like China.However, the mass production and misuse of antibiotics make them detectable in many places besides hospitals.In order to tackle the resistant bacteria, more antibiotic drugs should be taken so the resistant gene will be even stronger.Our survey indicates that people have misunderstandings on the correct use of antibiotics.Those tetracycline antibiotics not absorbed by animals will end up in soil and water, and eventually taken in by humans.Out-of-date antibiotic drugs are disposed randomly which is adding to the antibiotic residue pollution.[6] Tetracycline antibiotics can inhibit the development of children s teeth and bone growth, and are also easy to cause allergic reactions.High concentration of antibiotic residues in environment also encourages antibiotic resistance, since AR exposure is a form of \u0093underdose\u0094 as Fleming has mentioned.Chemosphere, 95, 604\u0096612 (2014)  [6] Tetracycline antibiotics - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics\"Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant\"\u00a0[1].Some cases of tetracycline pigmentation teeth have been speculated to have correlation with high concentration of tetracycline residues in drinking water.In China, about 147,000 tonnes of antibiotics are produced annually.However, the degrading super hero in the wrong place will be superbugs.Since penicillin was invented in 1928, antibiotics have been massively produced and have saved millions of people.", "design": "In our project, the engineered bacteria carry TetX, a natural antibiotic resistant gene.Mutagenic drift is particularly important for toxic proteins- or essential genes-based \u0091kill switches\u0092, for the selective pressure imposed on bacteria may lead to a dramatic alteration in the gene frequency.In the beginning, we put tetX gene directly under the control of pTet, a tetracycline-inducible promoter, so that the expression level of tetX will rise as the concentration of Tc goes up.Among them, Type II TA modules are the most extensively studied, so we decided to choose some of them to build and test our \u0091kill-switch\u0092.The gene coding T7 RNAP is placed downstream of pTet so that when the concentration of tetracycline increases, the amount of T7 RNAP will also increase to produce more tetX.Actually our goal is to apply our engineered bacteria to the degradation of as many as possible kinds of antibiotics which was theoretically feasible with different degradation enzyme and our system (details are shown below in \u0093Extension\u0094).Currently there are mainly three strategies to design a \u0091kill-switch\u0092: (1) Suicide system, where toxins or essential genes are commonly used to mediate cell death ;(2) Codon reassignment methods change the corresponding amino acid of a certain codon , like stop codon, and sometimes unnatural amino acids are assigned to that \u0091new\u0092 codon ; (3) Auxotroph is also commonly used.For this reason, the E.coli bearing the original circuit is called \u0091Scavenger\u0092, and the E.coli bearing the circuit with T7 RNAP is called \u0091Captain Scavenger\u0092.Genetically modified bacteria mainly pose threats to the environment through two ways: horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and bacteria escape.molecular oxygen (O2) is incorporated into verruculogen without O\u0096O bond scission, which lead to the oxidative transformations of substrate this Mononuclear non-haem iron enzymes catalyse a wide range of reactions Tet X:TetX monooxygenase catalyzes regioselective hydroxylation at carbon 11a of tetracyclines.It ought to be neutralized by its corresponding protein when, like in the waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), it is not expected to suppress the growth of bacteria.Structural basis for a new tetracycline resistance mechanism relying on the TetX monooxygenase.After literature survey, we eventually chose four kinds of oxidase which can be expressed in E.coli and hopefully have opportunities to degrade tetracycline: MnCcP, CPO?FtmOx1, tet X. CPO: catalytic oxidative degradation of sulfamethoxazole by CPO-H2O2 in the presence of chloridion.To further improve the performance of the scavenger, T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) and T7 promoter are introduced to raise the expression level of tetX.Whilst natural existing antibiotic resistant enzymes serve as a pool for finding the right ones, other enzymes with similar mechanisms also have the potential to degrade antibiotics at a high rate.The concentration of Tet remains high in the biochemical pools before water leaves it, so bacteria can grow normally in the pool.Secondly, the toxin must be toxic enough to kill the bacteria with a relatively low dose.To check the state of the scavengers, a fusion protein tetX-GFP (BBa_K2150013) combining tetX (BBa_K2150101) with GFP (BBa_E0040) is constructed to replace the role of tetX.To be more specific, auxotrophic genetically modified microorganisms (GMOs) rely on a kind of substance added into the working environment.These bacteria depend on an artificial molecule added to the working environment to survive.Nonetheless, if the artificial bacteria escape from the work environment, the concentration of Tet in surroundings drops dramatically.In order to transform an ordinary E.coli into a terrific scavenger who can eliminate tetracycline(Tc), tetX gene has to be imported to E.coli, enabling it to degrade Tc.This figure also illustrates our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design, see below.This figure also illustrates our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design, see below.After a series of primary lab experiments such as transformation, protein expression, purification of protein, enzyme assay and so on, we intended to accomplish the screening tests of all kinds of enzymes we have selected, as well as enzyme activity tests and kinetics tests for enzymes with high tetracycline degradation efficiency.Enzyme with the best degradation performance would stand out through our screening and would be applied to the construction of engineered bacteria, whose degradation effect in vivo would be tested in further experiments.As antitoxin degrades faster than toxin in the cell, it soon disassociates from toxin, leading to accumulation of free toxins within bacteria cell, which eventually result in cell death or arrest of growth.No matter what method is taken to build the \u0091kill-switch\u0092, a good one should meet some criteria, namely, to prevent mutagenic drift , environment supplement and HGT.Tigecycline Is Modified by the Flavin-Dependent Monooxygenase TetX.In the presence of T7 RNAP, T7 promoter is recognized and activated, leading to increased transcription of downstream gene.In solutions of pH greater than 1, the product 11a-hydroxytetracycline can decomposes rapidly and non-enzymatically into products that are not easily identifiable oxidative reaction of tetracycline catalyzed by TetX The monooxygenase reaction mechanism relies on the redox properties of FAD.However, this does not mean that the toxin is not controllable.While staying in the biochemical pool at WWTPs, antitoxin is induced by high concentration of Tet.TA modules are composed of a toxin molecule and an antitoxin molecule, and can be categorized into five types .We expected the circuit with T7 RNAP to perform better than the one without.In contrast, the expression of toxin will not be impaired in either condition.This fact is fundamental to our \u0091kill-switch\u0092 design.Due to this high activity of T7 promoter, tetX protein can be produced in large quantity when tetX gene is expressed from T7 promoter.Without sufficient amount of Tet, the transcription of antitoxin is blocked by tetR.For those \u0091kill-switches\u0092 which make use of auxotrophies, environment supplement is a major challenge.CPO is considered to be the most versatile heme-containing enzyme, exhibiting peroxidase, catalase and cytochrome P450-like activities MnCcP : Crude MnP produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was used to degrade tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) in the presence of Mn2+ and H2O2 .MnCcP is a designed CcP with a Mn(II)-binding site by making Gly41Glu, Val45Glu, and His181Asp mutations, which can be expressed in procaryotic organisms.However, the real situation is much more complex than that.Since many of the oxidases require coenzymes or cofactors to function, they may have problems expressing in prokaryotic cells or for in vitro characterization.In this condition, TetX is also expressed and it oxidases Tet in vivo.Biochemistry.44, 11829-11835 (2005) [10] Gesa Volkers, Gottfried J. Palm, Manfred S. Weiss, Gerard D. Wright, Winfried Hinrichs.In our experiment design, we just took tetracycline degradation as an proof-of-concept.We designed a \u0091kill-switch\u0092 based on TA module.After reduction to FADH2 by NADPH, the isoalloxazine binds molecular oxygen to form a hydroperoxide.First of all, toxins and antitoxins should be readily expressed in E. coli, which is a basic requirement for genetic engineering in all circumstances.For example, a number of resistant proteins degrade antibiotics by oxidizing them, so other oxidases with similar or same coenzymes are highly likely to degrade antibiotics in similar ways.In order to build a good \u0091kill-switch\u0092, there are some major aspects we should consider.(2015) 539-543 [9] Ian F. Moore, Donald W. Hughes, and Gerard D. Wright.", "human_practice": "Although it is really difficult for a project in laboratory to meet criteria for commercialization, we were really inspired how synthetic biology can make people live better in the future.(d) Most people think it is OK to use artificial bacteria in WWTPs or hospitals to degrade AR as long as there is certain mechanism is deployed to make the system safe, which is exactly why we designed a double-function safe lock to prevent HGT and leakage at the same time.After the speech, we also talked with some investors from different countries, and learned that how government policy and support can influence their decisions, which is actually what synthetic biology lacks.That is also why we designed a double-function safe lock, preventing horizontal-gene-transfer and bacteria escape at the same time (see our Design part).During the poster session, we introduced to interested attendees the disasters antibiotic abuse may cause and tried to arise their awareness of careful usage of antibiotics (Fig.In our survey, we found that nearly 60% of all participants know the terminology and the mechanism underlies.In the morning on 4th SEP, we gave a presentation on our own project: the Ultra-sensitive Controllable Antibiotics Scavenger (Fig.55% of them believe that antibiotic residues can be found in sediments, and this proportion is the lowest among those chose surface/underground water and farm lands.This figure presents part of the results of our internet-based survey on antibiotic residues (AR).A surprisingly small number of people know the fact that antibiotics are widely found in drinking water, as indicated in the graph.As a new team taking part in iGEM for the first time, we benefited a lot from it.Mr. Schroeder is a Penn Alumni and is the only patent attorney on the industrial advisory board of SynBERC (the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center), a major U.S. research program to make biology easier to engineer.We explained our design and other work in detail, as well as introducing tremendous damages caused by antibiotic residues and our special design to solve this problem with the technique of SynBio.On the first weekend in September, we attended Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC).This indicates that even professionals know little about the scale and harm of antibiotic residues.Particularly, Mr. Schroeder also talked about how the iGEM competition has contributed to the development of synthetic biology and its industrialization.Our team sincerely wish more and more people, especially technical talents, can join the battle against antibiotic abuse with us, creating a safer and healthier future for the human beings.In general, the public underestimate the harm of antibiotic residues in environments and industrial products.China, as the world\u0092s biggest and the most fast-growing economy, is also catching up in scientific research.When questioned whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms(GMOs) in waste water treatment plants(WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory.We also designed several questions on antibiotic residues, which is directly linked to our project.Antibiotic abuse is one of the major causes for antibiotic resistance, and this has gained much awareness from the general public.In CCiC, we tried our best to make everyone realize the importance of dealing with antibiotic residues more or less.We designed a questionnaire and conducted an internet-based survey on antibiotic resistance, antibiotic residues and asked participants\u0092 opinions (especially safety concerns) on our project.At last, we asked people about security problems in our project.After presentation, we received a lot of attention from teachers and some other teams, further answering their questions about our project.From Mr. Schroeder\u0092s speech, we learned how synthetic biology could be applied to produce real products that are closely connected to environment protection, manufacture green material and so on.What is more, we also observed that biological majors did not outperform non-biological majors on antibiotic residues.People tend to believe that antibiotic residues widely exist in nature.(a) Most use antibiotics according doctor\u0092s prescription, but abuse in hospital is also a prominent problem.Most of them (at least 67%) know that antibiotics can be detected in meats (poultries, fish and cattle), but only 30% said they know antibiotics occur in drinking water, with merely 24% chose honey.", "modeling": "Since the quantity of substrate is limited in our experiments and the parameters should have clear physical meaning for further analysis, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model[5] as follows?

L. Shuler, S. Leung, and C. C. Dick, Mathematical Model For The Growth Of A Single Bacterial Cell, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1979, 326(326):35\u009652.The maximums of growth rate is slightly affected by the toxin of aTc, but it will do not change the discussion above.[2] Bruce R. Levin, Frank M. Stewart & Lin Chao, Resource-Limited Growth, Competition, And Predation: A Model And Experimental Studies With Bacteria And Bacteriophage, The American Naturalist.For any given ${gamma _P}$ , equation (23) can be fitted by multiple linear regression.The accurate solution of equation set (5) is not necessary because the expression of toxin only affect the terminal concentration of tetracycline degradation.Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.In addition, the growth rate curve of toxin 136 shows that the performance of antitoxin is not as good as others, thus we only focus on toxin 134,1204 and 6429.Accordingly, we can assume that the growth rate of total number of plasmids is equal to that of cells: Firstly, we discuss the solution of equation set (9) when ? is constant.At a concentration of around $0.8\text{ }!!~!!\text{ }!!mu!!\text{ g}/\text{ml}$ to $1..5\text{ }!!~!!\text{ }!!mu!!\text{ g}/\text{ml}$, a rough boundary can be seen, which confirmed that a switch effect occurs.The fitted values for parameters are shown in the table 1.From table 3, we can conclude that the corresponding antitoxin of toxin 6249 is most efficient.Then we assign ${gamma _P}$ point by point with a step of 0.000001 and find the best ${gamma _P}$ that maximize the linear coefficient.Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied.In the tetracycline uptake process of E.coli, two systems are involved: the rapid concentration-driven system which occurs initially and is insensitive to metabolic inhibitors, and the slow energy-driven system whose rate is only one-tenth of the rapid system[19].In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy, and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods, to show the influence of toxin and toxin-antitoxin coupling.For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.Can there be a model that fulfill the same functions as the traditional models, but with less parameters and with the least experiments?From the analysis mentioned above, we can conclude that toxin 6249 is most toxic and stable, its antitoxin is most efficient in neutralization as well.The example above clearly demonstrates the fact that, ODE model is sensitive to the values of parameters.Bacteria growth and protein expression are the most fundamental issues in synthetic biology.Therefore v(t) can be solved: Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density.Therefore, we employ ingenious tactics to build a practicable model of antibiotics degradation protein expression, bacteria growth under toxin-antitoxin coupling, and the overall circuit by in-depth analysis with least experiments.As is shown in figure 11, B(c) is low but not zeros when the concentration of tetracycline is zeros, this phenomenon indicates that leakage of promoter happens.Though it is still unknown whether the concentration-driven system can be categorized as passive diffusion or facilitated transport, the transportation rate is in proportion to the gradient of tetracycline concentration.The term 1 and term 4 of equation (12) take the vast majority of the sum of absolute values.5 Test result of the hypothesis for each type of bacteria in different concentration of aTc.We respectively measured the bacteria growth under different concentration of anhydrotetracycline(aTc), which induce the expression of toxin.On the contrary, bacteria are not influenced by the toxin inducer when antitoxins are expressed earlier.In mathematical form, the numerical relation is: So, we can assume that the existing toxin molecules are either in binding with target molecules, or in the toxin-antitoxin complex.[21] Goryachev A B, Toh D J, Lee T. Systems analysis of a quorum sensing network: Design constraints imposed by the functional requirements, network topology and kinetic constants[J].From another perspective, we can see that toxin 134 is inactivated before the antitoxin is induced by IPTG, which is because the leakage of antitoxin promoter or the instability of toxin.Dots are experimental values, and red curve is the fitted results.To make things worse, the ordinary differential equations are sensitive to parameters, and the errors will be amplified with time.Part 2 deals with the expression of tetracycline resistance protein, we use piecewise linear method for simplification, eigen decomposition method to extract the dominant sector.During the delay, antitoxin are synthesized and form binding with toxin.As long as the toxin is neutralized by its antitoxin, bacteria return to the normal state and grow as if in free conditions.Models usually relay on searching the parameters from previous works, but the values are measured under different conditions by different methods so the errors cannot be simply ignored.As expected, the shape and maximum are the same within error limits, and a delay can be clearly seen.The antitoxin is produced to neutralize toxin and the excessive part is degraded.Later, B(c) increase rapidly and reach its peak at around 2.5 mg/L, at which concentration the promoter is activated to the most.The form of the model is too complex, but the result shows that the replication period is converged to be synchronized with cell cycle.Our model minimizes the necessary experiments to get all necessary parameters, which is conducive to the industrial appliance and also propagable to modeling of other projects.It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions.Then the differential of tetracycline concentration within the cell caused by diffusion can be calculated directly.5, it can be convinced that the experimental group is the same as the control group under low aTc concentrations at the confidence of 90%, and distinct from control group under high aTc concentrations.Firstly, we add aTc in gradient concentration and excessive IPTG(8mmol/L) at the same initial time and measure their growth, as is shown in Fig.3 shows the growth of bacteria with toxin 1204 plasmid.The green curve is the mean value, and red area is the range mean value added and subtracted by the standard error.The bindings of first two processes are the limiting and rate-defining step.All of these substances can be degraded, therefore each has a degradation rate.It cannot be ignored because the lifetime of protein is rather stable that mRNA and peptide chain.Modeling is the art of description, estimation, prediction and optimization with limited knowledge and experimental data, which is exactly what we have to face.The demonstration above shows how to select an appropriate TA block with the mathematical model.[1] Liu, Y. Overview of some theoretical approaches for derivation of the Monod equation, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology.It can be expected that equilibrium sector and the degradation sector will still be the dominant ones when parameters are time-dependent.$G=Papp\times frac{A_{0}}{V_{0}}=0.67 s^{-1}$.We add a normal-distributed random relative error with a maximum of 5% to each of the 9 parameters in their model, which is far within the significant digit of these parameters.Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.Figure 9 is the calculation result, and the red area is the 70% confidence interval.The result shows that a much longer time is needed for bacteria to overcome the effect of toxin, if antitoxin is induced later than toxin.Since the bacteria in our experiments are of same species and are prepared by a same procedure, we regard the initial value of v as a constant in all these experiments.Therefore, a model with as many as 9 parameters collected from different sources are not only unnecessary but also unreliable.The reason for the delay is that, the way across the cytomembrane is different for aTc and IPTG.We fit the data with methods that mentioned previously, toquantify how parameters in growth function change with toxin.White blocks represent that the hypothesis cannot be rejected at the confidence of 90%, and colored blocks represent rejection at the same confidence.It takes the longest time for bacteria cells to overcome the effect of toxin 6249 after antitoxin is induced, therefore toxin 6249 is most toxic and also stable.In part 3 we integrate the two parts into a complete model, with which we do simulations to reach our conclusions.We study the effects of toxin alone on cell growth in our experiments.Bacteria with genes of aTc induced toxin 134, 136, 1204, 6249 and their corresponding IPTG induced antitoxin are prepared.OD600 (red)

replication, mRNA stability, protein synthesis, cell-wall biosynthesis, and ATP synthesis [9].Thus, we only retain term 1 and term 4 in our equation.The latter is not as important as the former, hence we only consider the concentration-driven factors.8.Growth rate of bacteria with TA system induced by aTc and excessive IPTG at different time.To exemplify how error can be amplified, we would like to

degradation enzyme can only be expressed under high concentration of tetracycline antibiotics.In our questionnaire, we asked people about security problems in our project, for instance, whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory.That is also why we use a biocontainment strategy and prevent bacteria escape at the same time.So these degradation enzymes won\u0092t exert negative impact outside laboratory, and won\u0092t harm any plants, animals or human beings.We choose a non-pathogenic chassis, E.coli, and pay high attention to our project design, lab work, shipment, etc.Most of the culture medium containing antibiotics should be inactivated by high temperature of autoclaved sterilization.Our engineered bacteria will not express degrading enzymes unless antibiotic is presented, and it kills itself after leaking into wrong places.According to the requirements of iGEM policy we never performed any dangerous experiments in daily experiment or faced any unusual safety issues.The team members followed some basic regulations as below: All involved participants needed to understand the experiment and follow the safety regulation in laboratory.All laboratory waste should be classified into three categories, including glass, plastic and paper before throwing into garbage cans.This year\u0092s UCAS iGEM Team is trying to develop a safe, smart and efficient system

part of the Decyclifier system is to degrade the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, into less toxic compounds using the degrading enzymes laccase and dioxygenase.It was uncertain whether the cells had the secretion system enzymes that would enable enzymes with a HlyA tag to be transported through the cell membranes.We chose a sensor that could react to salicylate when present; the production of our degrading enzymes would start in combination with a modified red fluorescent protein, dTomato, that indicates that there are PAHs present.The enzymes to convert naphthalene to salicylic acid is incorporated in a separate construct plasmid (you can read about this part of the project here).When attaching a signal sequence to a gene encoding an enzyme there can not be stop codons in between because the two genes need to be expressed together as one polypeptide chain.Two Nsil restriction sites were put before and after a 6xHis-tag so that the enzyme could be purified with an IMAC and so that the tag could be removed.It\u0092s a 60 amino acid long sequence attached to the C-terminal of our enzymes.This protein functions as a repressor at the other promoter in this construct, the Psal promoter.The end product in the extradiol degradation pathway is an aldehyde which is much more harmful to the cell than a carboxylic acid (Bugg, 1 September 2003).The laccase and dioxygenase gets translated and transported to extracellular space thanks to the HlyA-tag (See secretion system).Because of the copresence of naphthalene and other PAHs in the environment, this is a suitable system design.The end product in the intradiol degradation pathway is a carboxylic acid which is unharmful to the cell and can be used in the bacteria s metabolism.When these compounds are being degraded by the expressed laccase and dioxygenase we want to have an indication that our system is working; one that could easily be detected.The switch is connected to a fluorescent reporter gene which will indicate when PAHs are present and hence when the construct is active.Among the existing approaches for measuring the strength of a promoter, we chose to use fluorometry with the RFP dTomato as a reporter gene.We also want to include an on and off switch to the degradation pathway so that we do not stress the cells when the enzymes are not needed.This sequence is recognized by the Type 1 secretion system (BBa_K1166002) .The enzymes were purified and measured for activity using enzyme kinetics.The methods that we used for this part of the project, we thus chose to describe them on a separate page.When induced the expression of the red fluorescent protein, dTomato, starts and the degradation part of the construct gets expressed.We found one interesting repressor system known as the NahR-Psal-promoter which is a promoter that is induced by compounds similar to salicylic acid.This type of enzyme is used to catalyze cleavage of the aromatic rings in our degradation pathway.One of the main parts of our whole system is the visual response of PAH degradation.The gene is followed by a KpnI restriction site with glycines and serines on each side, which are small amino acids which increase the flexibility of the protein.We faced the need to characterize a promoter system inhibited by the NahR protein, which is induced by salicylate.One of the promoters, the Pr promoter regulates the upstream sequence of the construct, which also contains the coding sequence for the NahR protein.We decided to test the expression of the NahR/Psal promoter system with different salicylate concentrations.To assemble the HlyA-tag with the enzymes without getting a scar, two different methods were tried.This is needed for the export tag HlyA , to make it easier for the resulting signal protein to be folded properly.A second KpnI restriction site is put after the HlyA so that the export tag can be removed easily.This enables extracellular degradation of PAH and therefore protects the cells from the toxic PAHs and its metabolites.The aim was to attach the HlyA-tag to the biobricks encoding the two laccases CotA and CueO as well as to the catechol-1,2-dioxygenase.It has then two stop codons, and a terminator at the end.A previous iGEM team, Peking 2013, inspired us to use the NahR construct (BBa_J61051), a system consisting of two promoters and a protein coding sequence.When salicylate binds to the NahR protein, the conformational change it undergoes makes transcription of the sequence upstream the Psal promoter possible.Contrary to the Pr promoter, the Psal promoter regulates transcription of genes downstream of the construct.The choice fell on fluorescent reporter genes, since measurement and quantification of the expression would be easier and less time-consuming.Inferring from the crystal structure of the enzyme, both its C and N termini do not participate in critical interactions within the enzyme, which makes them suitable sites for export tag fusion.The mutation has been proved to have more efficiency to degrade ABTS than the unmodified one.We choose to work with D439A/M510L due to its efficiency and the supposed impact it would have on our constructs degradation time (Kataoka, K et al.This construct was intended to be compared with a construct without the secretion system to see if any of them had exported proteins.", "design": "As such the Decyclifier reactor will need to be emptied and the remaining sludge deposited as was previously done, however now no longer containing PAHs.For the Decyclifier reactor we purpose a simple batch-mode model, due to the lengthy process of the PAH degradation (approximately 10 weeks for a 100 m3 batch).We suggest that these two types of ash should be sludged with water and supplied to the Decyclifier bioreactor.Judging from our tests in the lab, the Decyclifier is capable of surviving high concentrations of pure napththalene and can thus be assumed to also be able to survive fairly high concentrations of PAHs in the toxic ash.With utilization of our biosurfactant system and the optimized activity of our modified Laccase, one might assume that the Decyclifier reactor should be able to reach at least the higher level of purification, possibly also in shorter amount of time.Through the process, two types of ash contain considerably higher concentrations of PAHs.Based on similar reactors the inoculating concentration of the Decyclifier in the reactor should be about 50 g/kg.Due to the relative toxicity provided through other components of the ash, it is important to remember that the remaining material still needs to be disposed of after the reactor run time has finished.This would of course be a key experiment for the future assessment of the Decyclifier system.A key issue however is the fact that ash contains many other toxic substances in addition to PAHs.Preferably this reactor should be run using similar conditions as the main reactor to make sure that the cells are indeed functioning properly.It is hard to asses the actual building and maintenance cost of the system without proper knowledge of local conditions.As of yet no tests regarding the cells viability in direct contact with the ash has been performed.As such it will be necessary to also include a smaller pilot reactor for growth of the inoculating culture prior to PAH degradation.1: Input 2: Termometer 3: pH electrode 4: O2 electrode 5: Rotor 6: Gas input 7: Gas output 8: Acid/base input 9: Cooling jackets 10: Baffles 11: Fluorometer To implement the Decyclifier where it is most needed, in the waste plants, we designed a bioreactor (see figure 1) that would be part of the waste remediation process at facilities such as Uppsala Vattenfall\u0092s power plant.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "Figure 11 shows that the BaP degrading rate is not significantly affected by laccases and rhamnolipids being introduced in the system at time step 0 or 20.Laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the system at time step 0 or 20.Laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the system at time step 20.Laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the system at time step 20.Laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the system at time step 20.The number of BaPs in the system was studied during 500 time steps under different conditions; size of the interaction area, number of laccases, number of rhamnolipids and introduction method of laccases and rhamnolipids.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 10: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.In figure 12 introduction method A with laccases and rhamnolipids introduced to system at time step 0 is compared to B, continuous supply of laccases and rhamnolipids to the system, 1 laccase and 0, 1 or 2 rhamnolipids added every 5 time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 9: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 12: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 11: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.Figure 8: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.To study whether the introduction method of laccases and rhamnolipids into the system affect degradation of PaHs, different variations of our model were constructed.Laccases and rhamnolipids were either introduced continuously to the system, at the same time as the BaPs or some time steps after BaPs are introduced in the system.BaPs, laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the model with random positioning and for every time step they move randomly.By modelling the effect of the rhamnolipids in our system in Java we aim to create a visual and analytical tool for the extracellular reactions of the system during various time spans and concentrations of PAHs, laccases and rhamnolipids.Settings: 100 Baps displayed as blue molecules, 20 Rhamnolipids displayed as black molecules, 20 Laccases displayed as red dots and the delay between time steps set to 30 ms.The Simbiology model of the whole system proved the rate limiting enzymes in our system to be 2-hydroxybenzalpyruvatealdolase and 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, both parts of the naphthalene degrading pathway.As expected BaP degrading rate is higher in the beginning of the simulation for model A because of higher concentration of laccases and rhamnolipids.Graphs were produced using the mean value of the number of BaPs in the system for every measured time step.The Simbiology model showed us the rate-limiting step of our system, whilst the Java model showed that the system will indeed be improved by the presence of rhamnolipids.Not surprisingly, the degradation rate is higher the more laccases is present in the system.Figure 10 shows that degradation of 100 BaP is faster in a smaller space (650x650 pixels) compared to in a larger space (1000x1000 pixels) when all other settings are the same, BaP/laccase ratio is 5 and rhamnolipid/BaP ratio is 0, 0.2 or 0.5.This in turn causes the induction of our main system which finally results in the degradation of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.Concentration of naphthalene decreases over time at a slightly higher rate than the formation rate of salicylate.The main model has the initial value of 5 moles of naphthalene and 50 moles of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.This model will allow the user to get an overview of the laccase/rhamnolipid/PAH - system and how it works in theory as well as collecting data about the degraded PAHs over time during different conditions.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 20 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids in a 650x650 pixels interaction area.The initial values for the remaining substrate related components of the system was set to zero.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 10, 20 or 50 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids in a 650x650 pixels interaction area.This enabled analysis of the system as a whole with a slight focus on two of the different parts of the system.As such, the model only serves as a theoretic representation of the actual in vivo system but should still follow a similar pattern.These parameters can be analyzed separately for each part, or for the system as a whole.Figure 2 shows how the concentrations/proportions between the different components vary over time in relation to its initial values.Figure 9 shows how the breakdown rate of BaP depends on laccase and rhamnolipid concentration.Rhamnolipids can attach to the BaPs, and BaPs can form aggregates with other BaPs.These values are strictly arbitrary and serve only to create an initial outlook as to how the system behaves.One main model where the Decyclifier\u0092s whole degrading system is represented, one where the naphthalene degrading pathway is represented and one where the salicylate-induced pathway is represented.BaP degradation rate for B is very low at the beginning because of low concentration of laccases and increases as the concentration of laccase increases.BaPs are less likely to form aggregates with other BaPs if rhamnolipids are attached to the BaPs.The model is a simple representation of our system with Rhamnolipids, BaPs and Laccases, where BaPs represent PAHs and Laccases represent both laccases and dioxygenases.Figure 4 shows the relationship between the different components of our naphthalene degrading pathway.The salicylate induced pathway has the initial value of 5 moles of salicylate and 50 moles of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.Moreover, we seek to prove that our concept is valid and gauge the efficiency of the system.In addition, the relationship in amount between the BaPs and the laccases have merely been estimated and the size ratio in our visual representation is completely unrealistic.Doing so saved us from having to deal with the convoluted differential equations that inevitably follow from a system as complex as ours.Another major difference is that in our model, degraded BaPs simply disappear, as opposed to turning into the degradation product.The naphthalene degrading model has the initial value of 5 moles of naphthalene.Due to the complexity of the real system, strictly arbitrary values regarding association, dissociation and breakdown of the respective components had to be decided.Laccases degrade BaPs with higher probability if they are not in aggregates due to the increased probability of the enzyme s active site to reach the BaP.In figures 8 to 12 we see the effect of varying rhamnolipid concentrations in the system.It is clear from figure 9 that the ratio of laccase/BaP causes a greater degradation rate effect of BaP than the ratio of rhamnolipid/BaP.The collected data can give us an insight as to what degree the rhamnolipids improves the action of the laccase, and also what ratios that give the optimal enzyme activity.By modelling our system in Simbiology we aim to obtain a further understanding of the parameters that rule the whole Decyclifier system.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.This is likely due to the increased probability of two molecules encountering each other in a smaller space.The amount of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene decreases as well while the amount of intermediate breakdown product and the dioxygenase product, here annotated as unknown product increases.This is mainly due to the fact that the laccase in reality is so much larger than the BaPs, which would make a visual representation very hard to interpret.Due to the fact that most of these reactions are catalyzed with a single substrate, this serves as a fair approximation.In some cases, the data pertaining to the enzyme with our substrate in Pseudomonas putida was not available, and we had to resort to using related values.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 20 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids.", "notebook": "The products were run on a gel and this showed that the PCR was unsuccessful.A transformation on the ligations with CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2 dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag gene were transformed but with no results.Large overnight on the dioxygenase and the HlyA-tag with the J23110 promoter was made.We started assembling on of the laccase genes, CueO with the NahR and reporter gene system, while also continuing the assembly of the final enzymatic degradation construct by adding the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase after the modified laccase gene.We transformed our rhamnolipid construct in BL21D3 cells due to poor expression of mono-rhamnolipids in DH5?.Performed TLC test on the expressions from the rhamnolipid construct.Primers were designed for PCR extraction of the naphthalene upper pathway of the Nah7 plasmid from Pseudomonas putida, and to remove T7-promoters from CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase biobricks.rhlA and rhlB genes from the DNA distribution kit were transformed into E.coli DH5? and plasmid preparations were made.Transformations were done to insert biobricks with the enzymes CueO, CotA, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and the HlyA-tag genes into DH5?.We did the second PCR in the restriction free cloning with the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag gene.Since we didn\u0092t get any growth with CotA and HlyA-tag we decided to abandon the CotA enzyme.Ligation of the biobricks CueO and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with a standard promoter (BBa_J23110) were preformed.Performed digestion with KpnI restriction enzyme on the modified laccase sequence to remove the export HlyA-tag sequence.The products were loaded on a 2% gel and extracted to be used in the next step.We did a new 3A assembly with the correct HlyA-tag and our enzymes CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase.We also designed primers to do overlap extension PCR to remove the scar that was created when attaching the HlyA-tag with the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase genes.Stock solutions and agar plates with and without antibiotic resistance were made.Primers were designed for site directed mutagenesis to eliminate the restrictions sites for improving the NoKoGen biobricks, and primers were also designed for restriction free cloning to assemble the HlyA-tag with the CueO, CotA and dioxygenase genes, without creating a scar.It indicated presence of rhamnolipids.Analyzed differences in survivability between cells containing the naphthalene degrading pathway and negative control cells containing an RFP-coding gene by adding fixed amounts of naphthalene crystals in the lid of the agar plates.The RFC products with CueO containing the HlyA-tag and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag were sent for sequencing.Assembled dTomato construct at the end of our full rhamnolipid construct by 3A assembly.The CueO, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and the modified laccase genes was assembled with a secretion system.Phusion and Pfu was extracted from bacteria.Removed two PstI restriction sites from the naphthalene pathway through site-directed mutagenesis.The restriction free cloning for CueO and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase genes with the HlyA-tag was successfully executed.The first step in the restriction free cloning was done with the genes for the enzymes CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag.The CueO and the modified laccase genes were transformed into BL21DE3 cells.This as a preparation for building the biosurfactant construct.A first attempt to remove the T7-promoter from the biobricks with CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was done.Big overnights of BL21DE3 cells with catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, CueO and the modified laccase were made.Extraction and purification of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, CueO and the modified laccase.The rhamnolipid constructs was in pSB3K3, so they were transferred to pSB1C3 backbone as a biobrick requirement.The tested cells and its supernatants came from the transformation cultures of DH5? and BL21DE3 with promoters (BBa_J23101) and (BBa_J23110) as well as a DH5? with a simple RFP insert as a negative control.An anion-exchange chromatography was done to extract catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from cell lysate.touchdown protocol, gradients and adding DMSO was tried to remove the T7-promoter from the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase biobricks.Therefore the first PCR of the RFC was redone.The HlyA-tag was attached to the two laccases CueO and CotA that we had successfully removed the T7-promoter from with 3A assembly.The gel showed that the PCR had not worked.Since the NoKoGen biobricks had already been improved, transformation were done with the improved biobricks of rhlA, rhlB, and with RBS and the (BBa_J23101) promoter from the kit into DH5?.It was transformed into DH5? and the cultures were used for plasmid preparation to extract the DNA.Transformed our full construct with (BBa_J23101) promoter, RBS, rhlA and rhlB into DH5? cells.Frozen stock and plasmid preparations were made of these.Transformed the NahR construct, dTomato and super yellow fluorescent protein 2 (SYFP2), as well as plasmid prepared the transformed DNA and evaluated with PCR followed by further evaluation by agarose gel electrophoresis.Designed primers for sequencing of the Nah7 pathway, as well as primers flanking the entire pathway.The modified laccase gene without the export tag was also transformed into BL21DE3.Analysed the growth of our cells with the naphthalene degrading pathway with no naphthalene present, naphthalene present directly in cell culture and gaseous naphthalene presence.These pictures shows liquid culture containing naphthalene degrading pathway or red insert, where there is either no naphthalene present, naphthalene present directly in culture or gaseous naphthalene present.The reporter gene sequences and the modified laccase sequence were also assembled with two different Anderson promoters, (BBa_J23110) and (BBa_J23101).Grew bacteria containing Phusion and Pfu overnight in liquid medium.Made an attempt to extract the Nah7 plasmid using the designed primers, including gel electrophoresis of the PCR product.", "protocol":

was kept in a locked cupboard when not used and always handled in a fume hood.It was always handled in a fume hood with gloves and goggles.Because of all this it was always kept and handled in a fume hood.It was always handled in a fume hood with nitrile gloves and goggles.It was also always handled in a fume hood.Since this bacteria consumed naphthalene as a carbon source it was always handled with gloves and goggles in a fume hood when naphthalene crystals had been added.It\u0092s a solid compound that is highly flammable and was therefore always kept in a locker designed to keep flammable compounds.When handled it was always kept in a fume hood.It was always kept in a separate locker and always handled in a fume hood.It was always kept in a special cupboard for corrosive chemicals and thick gloves and goggles was always used when handling it.Because of all this the compound was always handled in a fume hood.It\u0092s also corrosive and causes damage to the skin so nitrile gloves was used.It can cause irritation to the skin and eyes and is also harmful when inhaled.This organism is safety class 1, but since there have been some cases where this bacteria have infected humans we took extra safety precautions when working with it; it was handled and kept in a fume hood.Since it\u0092s very harmful to aquatic organisms it was disposed of in a separate container and taken care of by the university.Orcinol monohydrate-This is a natural phenolic organic compound.When not used it was always kept in the flameproof locker.Naphthalene is harmful when consumed and is suspected to cause cancer and was always handled with gloves and caution.It\u0092s harmful when ingested and can cause irritation to the airways, skin and eyes.CTAB-Cetyl-trimethylammoniumbromide.Ammonium persulfate-This inorganic compound is used as a source of free radicals in the SDS-page procedure.When a new chemical or the like was introduced the safety measures on how to handle it was addressed as well.In our lab we were only allowed to work with bacterium with safety class 1.Although the harmful effects to humans is limited with this particular strain of E.coli you still run a risk of spreading antibiotic-resistance from the plasmids used in iGEM to other bacterium if you don\u0092t take these safety precautions.It\u0092s harmful when ingested and due to its corrosiveness it causes irritation to the skin and eyes.The one working with the substance was also always extra cautious when handling this chemical due to it\u0092s dangerous properties.It is also very harmful to the environment and can cause long term damage to aquatic organisms.When handled one always used gloves and safety goggles.It can be harmful when ingested, irritating upon skin contact, causes serious irritation to the eyes and causes irritation to the airways.Because of these all of the medium that contained metal salts were disposed of in a separate waste container and handled properly.It was therefore always stored in a locker designed to hold flammable compounds.This strain, the BL21-DE3, is also safety class 1 and the same precautions were taken as for the DH5?.All of these salts used were considered harmful when ingested and could have a negative environmental impact.It is harmful when ingested and can cause irritation when it comes to contact with skin.It also causes irritation to the airways.This compound is used in the SDS-page procedure to stabilize the free radicals.This compound is used in the SDS-PAGE procedure to denature proteins.Since adding water to this acid causes heat generation which causes the water to boil and to avoid injuries from splashing we always used goggles and thick gloves when using this acid.Acrylamide solution-This compound was used in the SDS-PAGE.This compound comes as a liquid and is very flammable.It also causes irritation when inhaled and causes severe irritation of the eyes.Pretty much everything in a lab can be a risk if not handled properly.Any organism we took into the lab had to be cleared by prefect of the faculty.The bacterium we mainly used in this project was the Escherichia coli DH5?.We still took safety precautions when handling the DH5?, such as always wearing a labcoat when in the lab and using gloves and goggles when they were needed.Since it it\u0092s hazardous for aquatic organisms it was disposed of in the correct way.It\u0092s a strong oxidizing agent and can intensify fire.When the plates containing CTAB were to be disposed of, a special waste bucket was used.", "keywords":

"design": "", "human_practice": "Secondly, we knew more supportive policies on the new environmental technology, and to know that the application of the genetic engineering in the disposal of pollution will not contradict the related laws gives us more confidence about our project.Overall, the heavy metal pollution of Chinese offshore cannot be overlook when we use seawater as material.In normal desalination process, even normal resource water has to go through some sedimentation processes.As to the opinion on the treatment of industrial polluted water, most respondents are unsatisfied and concerned about it since lots of problems still exist.In this part, we investigated the knowledge of heavy metal contamination and the knowledge of biological approaches dealing with heavy metals.So there is no need or trend to have the heavy metal pollution in a more detailed or specific legislation.In the second aspect, we questioned the supportive policies on new environmental technologies from the national and local government.Firstly, we obtained more legal knowledge about the pollution of heavy metals and water pollution, and thus we have a much clearer concept of the current legal situation in China.Many factories utilized the microorganisms to extract and purify precious heavy metal from the tailings.During the interview, Dr. Tang also asked us about the state of the metal that we retrieve as well as the adaptability of our bacteria.Also, there is a sum of considerable fund specifically supporting the circular economy from the government which we can take advantage of.In the third aspect, we demonstrated our concerns about the disadvantage of biological methods when dealing with the environmental pollution.Companies are optimistic about new technologies because not only are they beneficial for the company itself, the government encourages the development of new technology as well.In the end, Dr. Tang said that our project was aiming at a practical problem in our society and that we should improve the accuracy of heavy metal adsorption.And it offers an optimistic background to the development of new environmental technologies.In view of the fact that our project\u0092s target is pollution control and recycling, Mr. Wu gave us more advice on how to use policies and funds to support our project.We also propagated our project among the pupils and their parents to know about different opinions.After the activity, we interviewed the organizer of the environmental group and learned a lot about the environmental groups and development of sewage disposal in China.This also means that the factories can\u0092t avoid to deal with different pollutions in costal seawater, including heavy metal pollution.No doubt that it could be a promotion both for our project and the application of synthetic biology on environmental issues.On 4th August, we visited the BRUMP recycling technology corporation in Hunan Province.He explained that the heavy metal pollution is a cross-field pollution, so it can be cataloged into atmosphere, water or soil pollution so as to have a hierarchical supervision.Respondents reflect that the information is extremely limited and wish to learn more about heavy metal pollution.In a word, from the statistics above, both the resource and the number of respondents ensure that our survey is of convincing credit.There is a lack of useful and convincing information about the treatment of pollution.Therefore the first problem that we meet with is related to the living conditions of our chassis.In this concept, seawater desalination combing heavy-metal recycling will be the key to build the heavy metal\u0092s balance.The origin of heavy metal comes from the river, therefore, it is hard to control from the origin.Last but not least, we are inspired by the idea to expand our project to the disposal of soil pollution.During the visit, we interviewed with Dr. Tang, the adviser of the company about our project as well as the development of the sewage disposal enterprises.The advantage of our idea is that we only need to make sure that our engineered B. subtilis can survive in sea water while the low efficiency problem is also inevitable.Thirdly, we got information about the policies\u0092 support to industrialize our project.Furthermore, we will be dedicated to spread the scientific and objective attitude towards the transgenic technology to the people around in the future, since the more rebuttal there is, the clearer the truth becomes.2.NGO ( Non-governmental organization ): Leader of an environmental group in NanjingThere are many environmental groups which are devoted to environmental protection in Nanjing.Because of the serious pollution caused by heavy metals in these years, it is hard to make more detailed and revised laws in a short time, but the judicial interpretation has been able to greatly strengthen the enforcement of the standard.On the second problem about the further legislation, the attitude of Mr. Wu is negative.Nanjing-China team will explain the details which needs to be discussed to make this working for real.First, we start with the features of seawater and the end purpose of the combination project.Therefore, on July 3rd, 2015, we interviewed with the expert Mr. Cigang Yu, the research assistant from the research center for nature conservation and biodiversity, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People\u0092s Republic of China (NIES).Furthermore, he inspired us to use the biological methods to cope with soil pollution.At the end of the interview, Mr. Wu highly complimented our project and our in-depth thought on the law and policy issues of the project.In fact, one of the safety concern of general seawater desalination is what do we do with those sediments.Secondly, companies also pay a lot attention to whether the technology can cause pollution to the environment.He mentioned that these two problems are pivotal for the further development of our project.We have also shown to him our iGEM project as well as the iGEM competition.Also, the offshore is relatively big water body which makes the pollution hard to increase as well as decrease.The presenters in our team also got more familiar with the presentation.Therefore, it will benefit a large community if we help them participate in the iGEM competition.We also expressed our sincere appreciation for his patient answers and explanations.In conclusion, we did learn a lot from the interview.During the past two month, we have collected 498 samples.In addition, although the biological methods have the relatively low efficiency, it has more advantages such as the moderate condition and low-frequency of the second pollution.Unfortunately, the microorganisms used in our project were both chosen.The precious experience not only enlightened us about the design of our experiment, but also provided us with new ideas about synthetic biology.In his opinion, the genetic engineering project is only excluded by the agriculture, not the disposal of pollution.Therefore, we made contact with them and participated in the activity named \u0093Journey of Love\u0094 on July 26th, 2015.He wished that we could get a satisfying result in the final.One problem is that the regulations on the heavy metal pollution are vague with weak enforcement; another problem is about the necessity for the further legislation and regulation of the heavy metal pollution.As to the first problem, Mr. Wu told us that the current standard is actually a relatively early one, and the latest one is only a judicial interpretation.He also suggested that biological methods aren\u0092t the most prevalent yet except microbial methods.The interview clarified the attitude of Chinese government towards the transgenic technology, and helped us to have more in-depth understanding for the safety of GMOs, and to build up expectations for the future development of the transgenic technology.He also said that he was passionate about biological methods because there are inevitable disadvantages in chemical methods such as the high expenses, secondary pollution, low specificity and so on.We also consulted him about the aspects to which enterprises pay more attention because we wanted to improve the practical value of our project.Nevertheless, the technology also arouses widespread public criticisms in its legitimacy and morality.However, because it is plant, the study and application of mangrove will be relatively slow.Seawater desalination is one of the few seawater alternating technology that pumps in the seawater.On the one hand, the genetic engineering was what our project used, but we were not sure about whether the genetic modified bacterium we created would have some inhabitation from the government and the public.We also helped to show them how to use environmental detection device to test the concentration of pollutants in the river.Secondly, with the growing concern towards the pollution, the amendment and the government\u0092s implement of laws have been launched.Since that is the case, the transgenic technology is its basic methods inevitably.We put forward that the time of the policies\u0092 issuing is early and the incentive is not obvious, so is it necessary to have a further promotion of the policies?The key of transgenic technology is the transgene.The GMOs are now widely used in scientific research and are also applied in agriculture as the source of genetically modified food.Critics for GMOs, especially for the genetically modified food, claim that the risks of the food have not been adequately identified and managed, and they also question the objectivity of regulatory authorities.Firstly, the fund for environment technology comes from various sources such as the provincial research fund and Nanjing local government\u0092s investment.Among them, average lead concentration in the Bohai Sea is over the first seawater class, and some of the monitoring spot detect a number over the second seawater class.Besides, previous captains of Peking-iGEM and Tsinghua-iGEM were also invited to give speeches about the development of synthetic biology in China.The purpose of the interview was about the transgenic technology and GMOs.Also, there are concerns about the contamination of the non-genetically modified food supply from the genetically modified food.IT also brings some safety concern by introducing new species to original ecosystem.For example, the main recovery method focuses on mangrove in China.Thus, we should look at two projects\u0092 combination as environmental restoration and seawater alternation using the same artificial water flow.Back to circular economy, this will increase the force that heavy-metal waste change into resource with a low cost adding.The most important aspect is the manipulation of the technology.The introduction of a transgene has the potential to change the phenotype of an organism.All the 31 teams invited to the summit were invited to give presentations about their project.There are many technicians in the company who barely know about the principle of the technology.Many pupils were impressed by the pollution, exhorting them to no longer throw domestic garbage into the rivers.He believed that the support from the government is important but not indispensable because of two reasons.As to the age, respondents of 18-25 years old, such as university students, account for more than one-third of the total.The core of the concept is to maintain the balance between resource and waste.He told us that methods such as precipitation, resin adsorption, reverse osmosis and electrochemical methods are the most frequently used methods.Besides, they are very familiar with the conditions of the aquatic environment in Nanjing.We have been collaborating with each other since early July and the collaboration is still going on.Prof. Dai showed great interest in it and told us that he intended to organize their students to participate in the competition in 2016.In its report, the concentration of lead, copper, zinc and mercury in seawater which is over the first seawater class at some monitoring spots.The efficiency of absorption largely depends on the mobility of seawater.The summit was a rehearsal of the Jiant Jamboree in September.In China, this is one of the guiding ideology for the economic and society development.It shows that there are plentiful of ways but the Internet is the main information resource.Most of these criticisms are direct to the genetically modified organism (GMO), which refers to any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques.We have designed a questionnaire about the treatment of heavy-metal contaminated sewage both in English and Chinese and distributed it through the Internet.On the other hand, the efficiency of the biological method was relatively low, so we wanted to seek for more help at present.Mr.We come up with an idea of combining the two projects to achieve a win-win goal, which is to desalinate sea water with a high concentration of heavy metal.(For details about the institute, see \u0093Brief introduction of NIES\u0094 He is researching on the biosafety of GMOs.So we decided to do some tests to confirm whether they can survive simultaneously in sea water with heavy metal.Therefore, we believe more information should be spread widely in this part.In the meanwhile, most respondents don not know about biological approaches dealing with heavy metals.Sea water with high concentration of heavy metal go through our purification device first so that heavy metal contaminants can be adsorbed.We volunteered to take approximately 50 pupils to the polluted river called the Hong Hua River.That is to say, this survey covers mainly university students and intellectuals who have enough social experiences and are easily influenced by new-born stuffs.When surveying about public awareness of sewage treatment, most respondents (98%) pay attention to such sort of news in daily life, which illustrates high attention paid to water pollution.The idea of cooperating two project is to merge Nanjing-China team\u0092s project to achieve a new seawater recovery and utilizing system.The word \u0093circular economy\u0094 should be familiar to most people.The prospect of our project will be better as long as we keep polishing the details of it.On 14th-15th August, our team was invited by Peking University to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee).", "modeling": "Using matlab, we can solve technical computing problems much faster.Matlab has a wide range of applications, including signal and image processing, communications, control design, test and measurement, financial modeling and analysis, and computational biology.In our modeling, we use matlab to find out the influences imposed on protein expression by certain parameters, such as pH, ion concentration, etc.Our project uses Bacillus subtilis as the bioreactor to deal with heavy metals: Au, Pb and U.In the first part, we worked out growth curves of B. subtilis\u0091s vegetative state and spore state, using Logistic model.In the third part, we used GolB-Au as an example to shed light on the optimal concentration of metal ions and the time for binding proteins\u0092 saturation.Through modeling, we know B. subtilis better and find optimal experimental conditions.Therefore, optimal PH for growth is 7.0.Combining the experimental data with modelling, we found that sucrose is the best carbon resource for the high growth rate and maximum cell number.Combining the experimental data with modelling, we found that using corn flour as the nitrogen resource contributes to a high growth rate of bacillus subtilis, while yeast cream yields to the maximum in cell number.In the modeling part, we have built three models: Growth, Transcription-Translation and Bioabsorption.Besides, we can also find out whether our wet lab results conform to the modeling results.Considering the fact that proliferation is unhindered when resources are sufficient and minimal when resources have run out, our model couples growth (N) with resources (R).According to the results of modeling, you may predict what would happen under different conditions.Modeling also takes different forms, and the following is some examples of models:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This model is used widely.Modeling aims to build and use a model which provides a theoretical way to explain a phenomenon in a simpler fashion than the real situation.According to the previous research, PH and the resources play crucial roles on the growth of bacillus subtilis.In the second part, we compared the efficiency of three different promoters we use: Pveg, Ptas and Pcot and try to find which one has the highest efficiency.In spore state, bacillus subtilis is dormant and with strong resistance to the unfavorable conditions.[reference1] Referred to Logistic model, here are our equations.The experiment data shows that the number growth rate increases with PH increase when PH is lower than 7.0, but decreases with PH increase (>7.0).However, modeling plays an increasingly vital role in the research of synthetic biology.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "As we have mentioned above, we need to construct 16 kits, which proved to be successful.(Figure 1)During the experiment, we utilized a constitutive promoter Pveg, a biobrick part coding for eGFP and two terminators.", "safety": "Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created.These have caused a lot of excitement in the pharmaceutical industry as they will be cheaper to produce, allow quicker production, as well enhance the knowledge of virology and immunology.The organisms we are dealing with are B. subtilis 168, B. subtilis NCIB3610 and E. coli K12.High security facilities are necessary when working with Synthetic Biology as there are possibilities of bioterrorism acts or release of harmful chemicals and or organisms into the environment.These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow.B. subtilis is the most studied gram-positive bacterium and a model organism in studying chromosome replication and cell differentiation.Synthetic vaccines are now being produced in the lab.So we plan to design an airtight container and totally enclosed process to control the engineered bacteria to escape into the environment.As for the experiments, the experiments are mainly in the molecular level, so the risks are caused by the reagents we used.With the potential future creation of man-made unicellular organisms, some are beginning to consider the effect that these organisms will have on biomass already present.Scientists estimate that within the next few decades, organism design will be sophisticated enough to accomplish tasks such as creating biofuels and lowering the levels of harmful substances in the atmosphere.For example, FDA stated that enzymes derived from it were in common use in food and that nontoxic and nonpathogenic strains of B. subtilis have been used in a variety of food applications.They also argue that the development of these organisms will simply shift the consumption of petroleum to the utilization of biomass in order to create energy.Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health.These organisms can harm existing life by affecting the prey/predator food chain, reproduction between species, as well as competition against other species (species at risk, or act as an invasive species).E. coli is the most studied and utilized bacteria in synthetic biology.However, the engineered bacteria may be released into the real world.B. subtilis and substances derived from it have been evaluated by different authorities about their safe and beneficial use in food.After collecting and sterilizing, the bio- or chemical wastes will be recycled by professional chemical recycling staffs in our institute respectively.A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.During our research, we carried out experiments within the biosafety guidelines established by WHO.", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite": "BBa_K1701004",

Analysis)Experiments: Transforming the plasmids into DH10B (wild-type E. coli) and measuring for our gene products Proof of concept: Demonstrate the functionality of the plasmids We began by exploring the literature and academic papers on this topic.Unfortunately, ATP synthase was later dropped due to size constraints in cloning.We believed that overexpressing genes that transcribe ATP-producing enzymes would lead to a cell with more intracellular ATP.fldA: Codes for flavodoxin, an electron-transfer protein native to E. colipetF: Codes for ferredoxin, an electron-transfer protein native to SynechocystisE.Our team set out to design an E. coli strain that overproduced ATP and electron donors in order to create a suitable environment for nitrogenase activity, as well as increasing the activity of other cellular functions requiring ATP or reduced electron donors.We wanted to see if ferredoxin could be produced in E. coli and how it would perform relative to the naturally occurring flavodoxin at various levels of expression.We extracted fldA from E. coli MG1655 and petF from Synechocystis 6803.We believed that overexpression of these genes would lead to more reduced electron-transfer proteins available for various cellular uses.In addition to fldA and petF, we also identified pfo as a metabolically relevant.Check out our modeling page to learn why we decided to use this gene and the process of modeling of our Super Cells.Each group of plasmids had a different inducible promoter so we could fine tune the expression of our GOIs to make sure the cell was not overburdened to the point of preventing the desired behavior.3 1791\u00961797.BLASCHKOWSKI, H.

detail:The history of WashU-PSU iGEM teams and the Nitrogen ProjectOur conversation with Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa, who argued that synthetic biology could not end nitrate runoffOur interview of Ray Erhardt, an aquatics engineer, who thought that nitrate runoff must be dealt upstream of wastewater plants and in the fields themselvesWe spoke with members of the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board and the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, who both believed other, natural solutions to excessive fertilizer use could be more effective than synthetic biologyWe interacted with scientists and researchers at Monsanto and Intrexon who suggested new approaches to our project and backed our research and missionOur time spent interacting with future STEM students and high school teachers at Wash U and Missouri S&T and teaching them about synthetic biologyFor the past two years, the WashU-PSU iGEM team has been working to progress the Nitrogen Project.We thought that a cell with the perfect conditions for nitrogenase could also be used with other recombinant proteins \u0096 we\u0092d just have to select the right conditions to improve.While our new project still fit into the scope of the Nitrogen Project and we continued to understand the impact of nitrate runoff in the agricultural regions around St. Louis, we also began to consider other applications of our research.Nitrates leak from the soil regardless of fertilizer use and, instead, we should work to plant cover crops to soak up the excess.This had a very strong impact on our direction for the project.While we were still motivated to work on the Nitrogen Project, our scope was now adjusted.As a subsidiary of the Nitrogen Project, a multi-university initiative to end nitrate pollution, our focus for human practices was largely based on agriculture.While we were still motivated by this original application of our research, we began to seek out new venues for its use.Finally, we sought out advisors who could comment on the use of our supercells beyond an agricultural setting.While a GMO may be useful, they thought it wasn\u0092t the only option, and certainly not the most effective.Next, we reached out to the Missouri Coalition for the Environment.So we tried to carve out a new niche in the Nitrogen Project for ourselves \u0096 and we looked outside Wash U for help.Enter Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa.While our lab was not equipped for the method he suggested, we were inspired to use our spectrometer to get a rudimentary idea of ferredoxin and flavodoxin concentrations.Intrexon, another sponsor of the WashU-PSU iGEM team, allowed us to speak with one of their lead microbiologists.If nitrogen-fixing plants won\u0092t have the world-changing impacts we believe, were there other problems we could tackle with research that fit within the bounds of the nitrogen project?What other applications weren\u0092t we considering?After our conversation with Carlson, we took a closer look at the cellular conditions necessary for nitrogenase function.Initially, we called her to get a better idea of the environmental consequences of nitrate fertilizer runoff in the Midwest.We contacted companies that use synthetic biology for more industrial purposes, and asked them to comment on how our \u0093supercharged\u0094 cells could be practically utilized.To begin our education on nitrate runoff, we began with faculty within WashU in St. Louis.Mr. Erhardt had several contacts in the St. Louis area, and suggested we reach out to other regional authorities.We contacted the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board, the governing body encouraging sustainable farming practices in our area.However, we didn\u0092t want to abandon their work and shirk the resources and knowledge of the professors and graduate students who we would be working alongside all summer.At first, we requested time with Ray Ehrhardt, a professional engineer with a position in the department of Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering.From this experience, we learned that the runoff crisis stretches further than simply a dearth of new agricultural technologies.This summer program allows a group of approximately 30 students to do an experiment in each of the engineering school\u0092s main divisions.We discussed our project with local teachers participating in a BioBuilder workshop.They invited us to one of their monthly board meetings, where they commented on the usefulness of our project.Most farms in the midwest are privately owned and operated they said, and it is entirely possible to get these farmers to adopt practices that they believe can mitigate runoff.As for the runoff that does occur from plants, the popularized notion of \u0093industrial farms\u0094 spraying millions of gallons of fertilizer isn\u0092t necessarily true.We explained that the Nitrogen Project aimed to eliminate fertilizer use altogether.From his advice, we recognized that our strain had varied applications in industry as well as agriculture.Throughout the course of our project, we sought to apply our knowledge of synthetic biology through education wherever possible:We led two synthetic biology workshops for Washington University\u0092s pre-engineering institute.We found that the teachers were enthusiastic about including synthetic biology in their curriculums.We helped run a \u0093Building with Biology\u0094 event at the iGEM heartland regional meetup with our buddies over at UNL and Missouri S&T.One suggestion was that our cells could output ATP in a reactor for other cells\u0092 use.Opposed to GMOs, they advocated for other sustainable methods of providing fertilizers to crops \u0096 most poignantly, the unused resource of livestock manure that is plentiful in the midwest.In a way, our cells could act as a source of fuel for ATP-intensive processes in other cells.In our first group meetings, we had to determine if we, too, wanted to contribute.The crux of excess nitrate runoff isn\u0092t agriculture, they said.In future work, we think a cytochrome assay could prove more indicative of reduced electron donor concentration than a biotin assay.", "modeling": "When the wild type 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA reaction was knocked out and replaced with the ferredoxin equivalent reaction, wild type biomass was retained but there was no ferredoxin production.When the objective reaction is biomass production, FBA can be used to predict growth rate at different conditions.The figure above shows FBA as a pipeline.Thus, the pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction was replaced with the ferredoxin equivalent to achieve ferredoxin production.When running FBA, the biotin synthesis reaction carried flux, indicating that under the specified conditions, reduced ferredoxin was being produced.Unlike electron donor modeling, we did not have time to test these modeling predictions in the lab.Ferredoxin yield can be estimated by the ratio of biotin to ferredoxin flux.In order to determine the best possible source, we identified two reactions, knocked those out, and replaced them with equivalent reactions that used ferredoxin as an electron carrier.Biomass production can be achieved through various reactions (Product A, B, and C) and knocking out a reaction (closing a valve) forces the organism to obtain biomass through a specified reaction.aceE codes for a subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), a key enzyme in the pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction.Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is used to predict possible flux distributions that achieve optimal flux through the objective reaction.Flux was minimized over the subset of metabolic reactions that produced ATP and possible knockouts were identified by identifying the reactions that had minimums significantly higher than wild type.In doing this, there could not be negative fluxes when minimizing the flux values (a negative value means the reaction is in the reverse direction) so reversible reactions were split.These discoveries lead to two key wet lab approaches:The pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction was knocked out by obtaining a knockout strain for aceE.In the lab, we constructed new electron donor plasmids that had pfo overexpressed along with the electron donor genes.ATP could be further maximized by ensuring higher minimum ATP flux levels.Replacing the original pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reactions allowed for ferredoxin production, but there was less biomass production than wild type.By knocking it out, we were able to knock out the reaction.We modeled its overexpression, which predicts that there should be an increase in the production of reduced electron donors.The binary reactions were then added to the model to ensure that all flux ranges were positive.This ?aceE strain was then used in conjunction with our electron donor plasmids to further increase reduced electron donor productionWe were able to replace the PDH reaction by overexpressing pfo.", "notebook": "ATP

the cell extract was measured from 200nm to 700nm.Specificaly, in the graph on the right, there is a small hump near 430nm for the petF cells at the highest inducer level, indicating that ferredoxin was present in these cells.As seen in the graphs below, our electron donor producing cells seem to show the characteristic peaks of their respective electron donor.The red color is likely due to the increased amounts of ferredoxin in the cell, which E. coli does not naturally produce and therefore regulate.This graph also shows that our modeling prediction, that ?aceE cells should have increased electron donors due to the knocking out of a competing pathway, was correct.The amount of intracellular ATP initially produced could be determined by adding luciferase and luciferin (the substrate) to our ATP producing cells and measuring the amount of luminescence produced.Post-induction, the cells that contained the petF or petF-pfo constructs had a distinct red color.\"Ferrodoxin and flavodoxin

"modeling": "Finally, we can get the unstable diffusion differential equation while the enzymes near the cells are secreted along direction r.$$frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} = Dfrac{1}{{{r^2}}}frac{partial }{{partial r}}({r^2}frac{{partial E}}{{partial r}}) + {r_E}$$Integrate the equation above then we can get the distribution equation of the enzyme concentration.If we use the diffusion rate equation, the rate of enzyme diffusion from cells to liquid phase body can be described as:[frac{{d{E_x}}}{{dt}} = {k_c}{a_c}({E_c} - {E_x})]Mass transfer process of enzymes from liquid phase to the surface of PETSimilar to the process of diffusion from cells to liquid body, based on Fick\u0092s first law and mass conservation we can get the differential equation of the diffusion process.$$frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} = D(frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {x^2}}} + frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {y^2}}} + frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {z^2}}}) + {r_E}$$If we integrate the formula above, we can get the distributing equation of the enzyme concentration.Similarly with the diffusion rate equation, the equation of the rate of enzyme diffusion from liquid to PET surface can be obtained:$$frac{{d{E_p}}}{{dt}} = {k_p}{a_p}({E_x} - {E_p})$$The total diffusion equation of the process can be described as:$$frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = Ka({E_c} - {E_p} - Delta E)$$The loss of driving force of mass transfer caused by the enzyme concentration accumulation in the liquid phase.Assuming that the diffusion process in liquid phase is a dynamic balancing process, which means the concentration variation in the liquid phase body is equal to the rate of enzyme production, it can be describe as:$$frac{{d{E_c}}}{{dt}} - {r_E} = frac{{d{E_P}}}{{dt}}$$[frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = frac{{({E_c} - {E_x}) - frac{{{r_E}}}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + ({E_x} - {E_p})}}{{frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + frac{1}{{{k_p}{a_p}}}}}]So the relationship between the parameters in total mass flux equation and those in interphase mass flux equation is:$$frac{1}{{Ka}} = frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + frac{1}{{{k_p}{a_p}}}$$As we can see, the total resistance for enzymes in liquid phase is the resistance from cell surface to liquid phase body plus that from liquid to PET surface.As a result, the most of the resistance for enzyme transfer in liquid phase is that from liquid to PET surface, which can be described as:[frac{1}{{Ka}} = frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}};;;;;K approx frac{{{k_c}{a_c}}}{a}]After secreted by cells, enzymes diffuse to the surface of PET through liquid phase.In the process of mass tranfer, enzyme concentration in liquid phase will be balanced with that on the surface of cells and that on the surface of PET.Thus some enzymes will remain in liquid phase body.And the mass transfer process will lead to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface.This can be expressed by the equation below: [int_t^{t + T} {Ka({E_c} - {E_P} - Delta E)dt = {E_c} - {E_P}} ] The equation above is an integral equation.Corresponding differential equation is:[Ka[frac{{dT}}{{dt}}Delta E(t + T) - Delta E(t)] = frac{{Delta E(t)}}{{dt}}]Intergrate this equation and we get the relation between delay time T and time:The process of PETase adsorbing on PET surface and enzymes catalyzing PET degradationThe biodegradation of polymer by enzymes is a kind of heterogeneous enzymatic reactions.So the rate of degradation of polymer, the absorbed enzyme amount, the inactive combined enzyme mount, the density of ester bond on polymer surface and the superficial area have the following relation:[v = - frac{{d{n_{exp }}}}{{dt}} = A cdot {k_2} cdot {\rho _{EB}}({q_E}A - {n_E})]Connecting with the absorption balance and the substrate restrain balance, we can get the total rate of degradation equation:[v = {k_2}{\rho _{EB}}(frac{{{K_A}[E]{q_{{E_{max }}}}A}}{{1 + {K_A}[E]}} - {K_A}{K_B}{[E]^2}[P] cdot V)][[E] = frac{{[{E_P}]}}{{1 + {K_A} + {K_A}{K_B}[P]}}]The concentration of enzymes on the plastic surfaceBecause the concentration of enzyme is low in the system and the producing rate of MHET is equal to the rate of PET degradation, we can get the following formula:[, - frac{{d{n_{exp }}}}{{dt}} = frac{{Vd[P]}}{{dt}}]Considering that MHET in substrate restrain is easy to diffuse to liquid, which means the balance is small, we can get the final equation for plastic degradation:[v = frac{{d[P]}}{{dt}} = frac{{{k_2}{\rho _{EB}}}}{V}(frac{{{K_A}[EP]{q_{{E_{max }}}}A}}{{1 + {K_A} + {K_A}{K_B}[P]}} - frac{{{K_A}{K_B}{{[{E_P}]}^2}[P]}}{{{{(1 + {K_A})}^2}}})]The above equation is differential whose only variable is the concentrate of MHET.Connecting these two factor with the above total equation and substitute constants we can get:[v = frac{{c[EP](t - T)}}{{d + e[P](t)}} - f{([EP](t - T))^2}[P](t)]The concentration on PET surface is a function of time t-TSolve the above equation, then we get the curves of PET degradation rate in heterogeneous phase.From the figure above , the change of degradation rate can be divided into three stages no matter if there is liquid transmission.The mass transfer of enzymes in the liquid phase will cause some of them to stay in the liquid body and the delay of enzyme concentration changes on the PET surface.Based on the assumptions above and the description of PET degradation process in a heterogeneous system, we first establish the equation of measuring how much percent the PET degrades and how much the degrading rate is.We construct models for each step and finally deduce the rate curve of PET degradation by the enzymes secreted by bacteria in heterogeneous system.From this curve we can see that the degradation can be devided into 3 parts.In the first part, degradation rate is under the control of bacteria growth and enzyme secretion.In the second part, it is controlled by the mass transfer of enzyme in the liquid phase.In the third part, it is controlled by the catalytic ability of enzymes adsorbed on the PET surface .From the trend of the curve we can conclude that, in order to degrade PET with a higher rate or make the rate peak as soon as possible,what we first need to do is to promote the growth of bacteria.This will enhance the enzyme concentration.On the other hand, we can accelerate the diffusion of enzymes in the liquid phase.For example,shake cultivation or stirred culture,can eliminate the influence of time delay and make the degradation rate reach the peak fast.Our system assumes that PET degradation only takes place on the surface of PET.Although it s reasonable,as the degradation proceeds, small gaps will form on the plastics due to degradation.If they become so large that enzymes can diffuse into the interior of PET,degradation process will be accelerated to a huge extent.The next step of building models is to take the process and threshold value of internal diffusion into consideration.This will provide a more accurate model to describe the process of PET degradation in the heterogeneous system.Combining with the fraction of coverage we can get:[\theta = frac{{{q_E}}}{{{q_{{E_{max }}}}}} = frac{{{K_A}[E]}}{{1 + {K_A}[E]}}]Establishment of equation for rate of total degradation of PETAfter absorption to the surface, the combination and escape is a dynastic balancing process because of the competitive substrate.The enzymatic degradation is interfacial reaction before degradation in large scale.The whole process can be described in the following equation:[{r_x} = frac{{d{c_x}}}{{dt}} = {mu _m}{c_x}(1 - frac{{{c_x}}}{{{c_x}_m}})]Specific growth rate , namely the growth rate of a unit thalli concentrationWhen cells are in exponential phase, ? is generally a constant,soUnder the condition when t=0, cx=cx0, we integrate the formula above:[{c_x} = frac{{{c_x}_0{c_x}_m{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_x}_m - {c_x}_0(1 - {e^{{mu _m}t}})}}]Solve this equation and the growth curve can be obtained:The formation dynamics of expression product (PETase)The extreme diversity of metabolites produced by microbial fermentation and the complexity of biosynthesis routes in the cells cause the biosynthetic pathways and metabolic regulation mechanism of those metabolites to show diverse characterisitics.Then we use the general method of describing mass transfer process to establish mass transfer rate equation when enzymes diffuse from the cell surface to liquid phase body then from liquid phase body to the PET surface, and the distribution equation of enzyme concentration, respectively.When ??0 and ??0, the model is partial-growth coupling.Plug the cell growth rate into the equation to simplify:[{r_E} = frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = {c_x} cdot left[ {alpha {mu _m}(1 - frac{{{c_x}}}{{{c_{xm}}}}) + \beta } \right]][E = alpha (frac{{{c_{x0}}{c_m}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_m} - {c_{x0}} + {c_{x0}}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}} - {c_{x0}}) + frac{{\beta {c_{xm}}}}{{{mu _{xm}}}}ln frac{{{c_{xm}} - {c_{x0}} + {c_{x0}}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_{xm}}}}]Solve this equation and the production curve of PETase can be obtained:Compared with the growth curve of bacteria, we can see intuitively that at the beginning, the correlation between the enzymes production and the concentration of bacteria is high.Based on the stationary approximate theory, we can get the total dynamics equation.[\theta = frac{A}{{{A_0}}} = frac{{{q_E}}}{{{q_{{E_{max }}}}}}]The fraction of coverage by enzyme on the polymer surfaceThe content of absorption for enzyme per area on polymerBecause enzymatic catalytic step is a rete controlling step, the absorption on polymer surface is a dynamic balancing process.Rate of absorption:[{r_1} = d[ES]/dt = {k_1}[E](1 - \theta );]Rate of desorption:[{r_2} = d[E]/dt = {k_{ - 1}}\theta ]From r1=r-1, we can get: k1[E] (1-?) = k-1?.Thus we choose the ester bond number as an index to evaluate this degradation process.The calculation formula for calculating the number of moles of ester bonds (namely the number of moles when polymers are completely degraded):$${n_{EB}} = {n_{EB/{M_{rep}}}} cdot m/{M_{rep}} $$ The mole number of the broken ester bonds in theory(?mol)The molar mass of the repeat units in the polymer(?g/?mol)The percentage of degradation of ester bonds can be obtained through that ratio.Similarly, the degrading rate can also be described by a series of formulas shown below:The Equation for The Growth Rate of Enzyme ProteinsAccording to the characterisitics of microbial cell growth, Monod Equation is the most commonly used one.In our experiment we use engineered bacteria as machines to secrete PETase to degrade PET.At first the bacteria secrete PETase ,and then enzymes diffuse into liquid phase body from the cell surface ,from liquid to the surface of PET successively.PETase adsorbs on PET during which process the substrate binding sites of PETase contact with the surface.Finally PETase finds catalytic sites on plastics and combine them with its active center.Ester bonds are broken and chains in PET are ruptured,resulting in the degradation of PET.1.Marge constants:[v = frac{{c[{E_P}]}}{{d + e[P]}} - f{[{E_P}]^2}[P]]From the above figure, the rate of degradation without competitive restrain is pretty lower than it with competitive restrain.But the rate get down gradually with substrate restrain.Solution of PET Degradation Rate Considering The Whole SystemSolution of PET degradation rate considering the process of cells secrete proteinWe have got the rate of enzyme production by connecting with the growth process of cells before.Solve the above differential equation, we can get the curves of the rate of PET degradation as following:From the above figure, enzymes get to the absorption balance and get the biggest rate of degradation.We analyze and then make a conclusion that the mass transfer diffusion mainly leads to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface .Finally, taking that MHET, the product of PET degradation, will show competitive inhibition effect into consideration, based on the adsorption equilibrium of PETase on the PET surface, we use the steady state approximation theory and deduce the total kinetic equation of PETase degrading PET.Finally, PET degradation rate settle out because of both the two factor, mostly because the absorption gets its saturation.Rate of the whole process for cells to secrete and degrade in heterogeneous phaseWe just calculated the enzymatic degradation rate while ignored the transmission in the liquid.The universal model can be expressed by Leudeking-Piret Equation:[{r_E} = frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = alpha frac{{d{c_x}}}{{dt}} + \beta {c_x}]A product synthesis constant associated with bacteria growth(g\u0095g-1)A product synthesis constant irrelevant with bacteria growth(g\u0095g-1\u0095h-1)When ??0 and ?=0, the model is growth coupling.From those equations we can get the total mass transfer rate equation of the enzymes in a heterogeneous system.So there are two transfer processes before the enzymes adsorp on the PET surface.The mass transfer process of enzymes in the liquid phase bodyCells secrete enzymes to the outside.The rate of mass imported from the inner surface:$${r_{imp}}{\rm{ = }}{j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2}$$The rate of mass output from the outside surface is:$${r_{exp }}{\rm{ = }}{j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2}{\rm{ + }}frac{{partial ({j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2})}}{{partial r}}dr$$$${r_{acc}}{\rm{ = }}frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} cdot 4pi {r^2}dr$$Rate of exported mass \u0096 rate of imported mass + rate of accumulation \u0096 producing rate = 0$$frac{{partial ({j_{er}}{r^2})}}{{partial r}} + frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}}{r^2} - {R_E} = 0$$$${j_{er}} = - Dfrac{{partial E}}{{partial r}}$$Substitute and sort this equation.Finally PET will desorb enzymes.Establishment of dynamics equation for PET enzymatic degradationAssuming that there is a bonding site and an active center in the enzyme, it combines with the substrate through its bonding site and then degrades the polymer with its active site.And with the time passing by the correlation becomes lower and finally disappears.The Transfer Process of Enzymes in The Liquid PhaseThe secretion of enzymes from cells will inevitably lead to the increase of enzyme concentration nearby.The resistance of enzymes\u0092 spread from liquid body to the surface of PET is much larger than that of from the cells\u0092 surroundings to liquid body.5.On the other hand, the enzymes in the liquid phase will reach the surface of PET along with the free diffusion of molecules.Enzymes will act with polymers through their bonding sites and combine with the substrate after their secretion and diffusion to the PET surface from cells.It takes several steps for the enzymes to complete the degradation of PET.The degradation of PET takes place on the surface of PET.7.Since the classical dynamics equation for enzymatic reaction, Michaelis-Menten equation, is based on homogeneous enzyme- substrate system, it\u0092s not suitable to describe the process of the degradation of polymers.Solve this differential equation we obtain the degradation rate curve of PET under heterogeneous system.The Formulas for Calculating Biodegradation Percentage and The Degradation RateSince our project aims to degrade PET, we need to propose a stable index to measure the degree of degradation of the plastics and another one to measure the degradation rate.When there is competitive restrain, the change of degradation rate can be divided into three stages.Thus we utilize the Logistic Equation to describe the rhythm of the growth rate.Logisic model is a typical S-shaped curve that can reflect the inhibition effect caused by the increase of bacteria concentration in the fermentation process.In this system, the adsorption of enzymes on the PET surface will lead to the accumulation of the enzymes.That can be reasonable because absorption is just related to the concentration of enzyme on the PET surface.And when enzyme concentrations surrounding the cells are larger than that in the liquid phase body, a driving force will emerge, causing the diffusion of enzymes into liquid phase body.In this system the product molecules still contain ester bonds, as a result, MHET may act with the enzymes before its diffusion into the solution and restrain the combination between PET and PETase.We assume that the enzymes are firstly combined with the polymer substrate through their own substrate binding sites, and then the active centers catalyzed the degradation of the polymers.6.And the liquid transmission effect the second stage most, at which cells grow up and secret more.Here we choose to describe degradation rate and percentage.The role of PETase plays in the degradation is to catalyze the cleavage of ester bonds between TPA and EG.Then the enzymes catalyze to break the ester bonds, and the small molecules such as MHET will be released and diffuse into the liquid phase.Here a cell can be regarded as a sphere and there\u0092s a spherical shell composed by the enzymes in the outer surface of the sphere.The transmission will lead to loss of the effective enzyme and latency of arrival for enzyme to PET surface.Through the above description of the process, the enzyme need to find an active segment to combine with.Second, the secretion controlling stage at which the secretion rate gets to saturation because of the saturation of cell growth.This competitive restraint will lead to a declination in the catalysis rate.Although this equation is considered to be simple and effective when used to describe the growth of bacteria, it is only suitable under the condition that there is no other restrictive substances in the environment.So the concentration gradient drops in the concentration field near the PET surface.There exists feedback inhibition regulation in the growing process of a single bacteria.Enzymes are in

our professor Yingjin Yuan gave us a safety instruction in which he informed us about how to work in the lab and what was considered as good practice.The toxic reagents are carefully used fume hood and we have separate waste bottles for all of the byproducts with each reagent, so that the waste could be treated and properly disposed of.And our project, aiming at degrading PET in a biological way, will not only help to solve plastic pollution problem, but also by using the enzymes will reduce the environment re-pollution introduced by conventional chemical decomposition and landfill, which is rather environmentally friendly.The Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtillis DB104, E.coli DE3, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Rhodococcus sp.PCC6803 used are not thought to pose any risk to the safety and health of the public as they are all in Risk Group1 and not pathogenic, and they would not be able to compete outside the lab.Besides, all of our team members are required and suspected to obey our lab regulations and regular safety precautions, including wearing gloves, goggles and lab coats whenever working in lab, strictly no food or drinks in lab, no chemical and biological substances taken out of lab without permission and appropriate methods, regularly cleaning equipments and benched using ethyl alcohol as a precaution against spread of modified organisms and always maintaining a clean bench and super clean bench to reduce the fluctuation brought by contaminants.And all of our modified organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae[2], Bacillus subtillis DB104[3], E.coli DE3[4], Pseudomonas putida KT2440[5], Rhodococcus sp.Nevertheless, in a larger scale, biological research is also accounted as a sensitive and controversial subject, which needs to be paid more attention in the potential safety threats it may bring to researchers and public.Student Handbook For Laboratory Safety of Tianjin University Our project is on the basis of two nontoxic proteins, PETase and MHETase, whose basic functions are catalyzing the cleavage of ester bonds and decomposing PET[1].Also we perused the Laboratory Biosafety Manual of our school, which helps us bore the tips in mind.PCC6803[7] are in the Risk Group 1.We then continuously received stint training in service from our team advisor Yuan Ma.Even so, we still take rigid precautions in case any laboratorial

selected to participate in a Synthetic Biology Project of one the most important investigation centres of Mexico \u0097 CINVESTAV.", "background": "", "description": "The detection system for oxides of nitrogen consists of a repressor NsrR, which can be repressed by the inducers NO and NO$_2$, two promoters PyeaR and pNirK, which senses the presence of nitric oxides and expresses GFP and a double terminator.Having identified this gap, we set out to develop a device that can facilitate the implementation, and make measurement of pollutants easier, cheaper, and more accessible.Complete combustion in vehicle engines give off Carbon dioxide and water as products: $$\textrm{Fuel} + \textrm{Air} longrightarrow \textrm{CO}_2 + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{Unaffected Nitrogen}$$ However, most car engines in the developing world are not very efficient and produce carbon monoxide ($\textrm{CO}$) and oxides of nitrogen ($\textrm{NO}_x$) along with other pollutants.Our aim is to produce a portable, quick, and easy\u0096to\u0096use biosensor for environmental law enforcement agencies, and even consumers, that can detect for levels of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in vehicle exhausts and express corresponding chromoproteins as a result.The system is based on two separate gas\u0096sensing mechanisms that work together to give a range of results: The CO\u0096sensing mechanism uses the CooA transcription factor and two CooA\u0096dependent promoters: CooF and CooM.The change in color caused by the chromoproteins indicate the presence of oxides of nitrogenThe second system that works for the detection of CO, consists of an activator CooA, which is normally present in an inactive form in the system and requires the presence of two molecules of CO in order to get activated.It is composed of four parts:The pCooM device produces pCooM, which is a weak promoter, with a GFP expression.The system also comprises of two promoters including pCooF and pCooM that are sensitive to the presence of CO. pCooF is a strong promoter and requires the attachment of two molecules of CO, while pCooM is a weak promoter where the attachment of eight molecules of CO is necessary in order to express the GFP.The activated (CooA)2CO complex will now bind to the promoters, the activated promoter will lead to the production of GFP, that has the tendency to indicate that CO is present in the system.We used two different chromoproteins in our system.Our biosensor, on the other hand, will be cheap, easy\u0096to\u0096use, and highly portable.The project centers around a biosensor with two detection systems: one system for the detection of CO, and the other for detection of oxides of nitrogen, particularly, NO and NO$_2$.The parts are:The pCooF device codes for the strong promoter which senses the presence of CO, and then expresses GFP.The parts includes:The PyeaR device code for PYeaR promoter, which when interacts with oxides of nitrogen produces GFP.Usually a repressor in a cell is attached to two promoters; pYeaR and pNirK , when the cell is surrounded by NOx , molecules of NOx get attached to the repressor, relieving the two promoters which further transcribe a gene responsible for yellow chromoprotein.When both of the gases CO and NOx are present, the cell will transcribe both blue and yellow chromoproteins giving off a color in a shade of green.They have been linked to the deaths of 23500 patients in UK each year.The methods used for measuring gaseous concentration are Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) and Gas Chromatography (GC) for carbon monoxide, and Gas Phase Chemiluminescence for nitrogen oxides.It is composed of four parts:The PNirK device is used for the GFP expression.The total number of motor vehicles in Karachi is a staggering 1.82 million, with 16,000 new ones hitting the road every month.Although laws and regulations regarding vehicle emissions exist, the World Bank s Cleaning Pakistan s Air report points out implementation as a major problem.When CO is present in the system, two molecules of CO will bind to the inactive activator, thus making it active.The devices includes:The CooA device comprises of four parts and is responsible for the production of CooA activator protein.It uses four parts:NsrR device is composed of four parts and is responsible for the production of NsrR repressor protein.When there is CO present outside the cell, the CO device gets activated and gives off blue color.Oxides of nitrogen bind to the NsrR repressor which, depending on the concentration of nitrogen oxides, activates either the YeaR promoter, or both the Year promoter and Nirk promoter.The situation is worse for developing countries where air quality levels of 98% of cities exceed WHO limits.A World Bank report released in 2014 states that the consequences of air pollution suffered by Pakistan are the highest in South Asia; air pollution is responsible for more deaths than other high\u0096profile causes of mortality in this country.The NOx\u0096sensing mechanism uses the NsrR repressed promoters, YeaR and NirK, as well as the NorV promoter.The continuous deterioration of air quality,

all likelihood \u0097 it would turn out to be a bite too big to chew.CSS code to make the iGEM s right-side menus and other annoyances disappearOnce you have made your offline website, you will then paste its HTML code on your team s page, and link the CSS and JavaScript files (which you would also have to upload to iGEM).For example, they place all fonts in a fonts folder, and images in an img folder, and then use relative paths in the code to access these assets in their CSS or HTML code.When designing an iGEM wiki, you must not use local resources.After you are done developing the wiki, all you need to do to make your \"offline\" wiki \"online\" is to just copy and paste your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code on your iGEM Team pages.We then dumped all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at the very last hour on to the iGEM server.But you must take care of a few things if you want to follow this approach:Usually, when web developers develop websites locally \u0097 i.e., offline \u0097 they use all assets locally.You will quickly find it out using the Statcounter s analytics because none of your visitors will be opening this Notebook page, and it won t get registered in the Statcounter logs.Using StatCounter you can get useful statistics on your wiki visitors: You can view their IP addresses, the browser they were using, their screen resolution and operating system, the pages they visited, and how long they remained on any particular page.Instead, you should make separate HTML files for these reusable elements of the website, and then use the .kit language to import them in your pages as needed \u0097 super convenient if you ask me.Instead make your wiki locally first just like a normal website, and then copy and paste the HTML and CSS code on your team s iGEM pages.You can use the girdlover tool to choose the size of your h and p elements that follow the Golden ratio.Once you design you wiki, you would want to know how many visitors are visiting your website, and how much time they are spending on any particular page.By adding StatCounter s tracking code, you can track not only how many visitors are visiting your wiki each day, but you can also get the finer details, such as their country, their browser and operating system, their screen resolution, the referring link, the view time, and duration.A wiki using them will be slower than the one using Neat, which is a minimalistic and light weight framework \u0097 all the more reasons to start using Neat in your next wiki or web design project.iGEM provides a very basic editor to edit your Team s wiki pages, but using it is a real pain.Instead, you should first upload them to iGEM servers, and then use the absolute path of these assets in your CSS or HTML.Use Allow CORS and Cache Killer Chrome extensions during developmentWhen you are working on a local website which is using online assets, the assets will fail to load in your web-browser.Don t expect someone with a biology background and zero programming experience to be able to redesign the wiki.In case you happen to end up in a team in which no one has any programming or web development experience, then it s probably better that you stick with default iGEM wiki template and tinker with its styling to improve it or customize to your taste.For first timers, completely redesigning the wiki could be an overwhelmingly difficult experience, partly due to the scant information available on how to do it exactly.Here, we present some of the lessons we learned while completely redesigning our iGEM wiki for the first time in the hope that some teams in the coming years will find it useful.A responsive wiki adjusts its content to different screen-sizes by tweaking its layout so that the main content is always visible clearly without the user needing to zoom-in or scroll horizontally.A responsive website adjusts its layout according to the size of the device it is being viewed on.Searching responsive menus on CodePen churns out a whole catalog of menus that you could choose from and use in your wiki.Do you want a cool menu in your wiki?Use the Cache Killer Chrome extensionto purge the cache every time you refresh your webpage.Use Live Reload to automatically refresh the webpage you are currently developingEvery time you make changes in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, you will need to save these changes and then refresh your webpage to view the changes take effect.Either use Codekit s Preview feature or use Live Reload software to refresh the webpage automatically whenever you make any changes in your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.The smaller the size, the faster the webpage will load.Moreover, combine all your CSS files into single CSS file, and all your JavaScript files (except MathJax.js) into a single JavaScript file.There are three major grid frameworks you could choose from:If you use Bootstrap or Foundation, you will litter your HTML markup with presentation classes from these frameworks, which is not a good practice; the content should always be separate from its presentation.But you will find that the iGEM right-side menu will be still there, and your layout will be all messed up.We went through this and spent a fair amount of time solving it.Although iGEM provides a basic skeleton for the wiki \u0097 that can be easily filled by anyone who has some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS \u0097 most teams prefer to completely redesign the look and feel of their wiki.Once you ve done that, include the consolidated CSS and JavaScript files in your Wiki pages.For example, _header.kit file contains HTML code for the header section of our wiki pages and we are importing the contents of this file in the code above.For screen widths above 1000px, the iGEM wiki lays out the menu vertically as a sidebar.Don t use relative paths of your assets when developing your iGEM wiki offline.Always used absolute paths of your assets when developing your iGEM wiki offline.Example of use of relative path of assets.You can then use these fonts on your wiki as well.FontFaceNinja could be used to identify fonts on any element of a webpage.Off course, you would have to do a few minors tweaks to link your CSS and JavaScript files, but no major changes would be needed.One of the easiest way to find it out is to use the FontFaceNinja extension in Chrome to identify the fonts used on different elements of a websites.Developing a killer wiki would need skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Sass.You won t need to use any presentation classes in your HTML markup if you use the Neat grid framework.Codekit will compile the files for you so that the separate snippets are included inline in the final HTML output.Just add the following code at the top of your CSS to make all the annoyances disappear.In the above illustration of our responsive wiki, the picture and bio get re-arranged depending on the size of the window.In a responsive web design, the website tweaks its layout for different screen sizes for best user experience.Single CSS and JavaScript files will require single http requests; the smaller the number of http requests, the faster the website is going to load.HTML now contains only the page s content.You must also take care of the font size, line height, and measure of your text so that everything is easily readable and looks nice at the same time.We have combined all our individual CSS files (shown on the right) into a single minified CSS file (main.css) using CodeKit.Live Reload can work on both Windows and Mac whereas, Codekit is a Mac-only software.While developing your website locally, use .kit language to reuse your code snippet across many different pages.Similarly, _all_in_one_footer.kit file contains HTML code for the footer of the website.Your custom\u0096designed wiki can have as many breakpoint as you like, but we think that a single breakpoint, around 1000px, is enough.The default iGEM wiki template for the year 2016 uses a breakpoint of 1000px.You don t have to reinvent the wheel.Typography plays a key role in the look and feel of a website.All this information can provide you with valuable insights that you can then use to improve your current wiki, or the one next year.You will need to enable Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) using Allow CORS Chrome extension.Furthermore, you would also need to empty your cache every time you reload a page because you made some changes in it.<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/main.css\"> <!--End of on-canvas container for all the

product was intended to be in the form of a strip.To counter their concerns, we designed a  killbox  plan that will be used to  sterilize  the strip after usage.The twister in the middle can help breaking the wall in between them, degrading the engineered bacteria.To promote synthetic biology in Pakistan, we wrote a detailed policy paper to the government in which we gave them short term, medium term, and long term recommendations on how to do it exactly.After a thorough response and data analysis, we figured out that the general population was quite receptive to the idea of a bacterial strip test, albeit they were still unsure if the bacteria on the strip could spread into the environment and cause problems.Our new design, incorporates a box having two sections: one section in which the strip having the engineered\u0096bacteria will be placed in the nutrient media, whereas in the other section we will have bacterial\u0096killers.The strip can be used several times until the media gets expired.We also wrote a policy paper for the development of the field of Synthetic Biology in Pakistan.", "modeling": "It can be calculated by the following equation: $$P_{exp} = frac{\textrm{number of situations in which the promoter will be activated}}{\textrm{total number of situations}} = frac{w}{z} label{4} \tag{4}$$ In our modeling of the CO-sensing system, we have assumed that at any moment only one molecule of the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ can bind to the promoter, and that the \ref{R1} reaches equilibrium before the transcription of the system begins.To develop our equations further, we say that the number of situations in which a promoter will be activated is equal to: $$ w=\textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]}=frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p} label{5} \tag{5}$$ Eq.(\ref{5}) demonstrates the relation between the binding of the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$, showing that it is equal to the amount of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ upon the dissociation constant of the binding of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ to the promoter.To simplify this equation, we assume that the number of situations in which the promoter will not be activated by $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ is equal to $1$.Note that this assumption is made because the only situation in which transcription will not take place is when there are no molecules bound to the promoter.Substituting the assumptions in Eq.$$\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]} longleftrightarrow \textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]} label{R2} \tag{R2}$$ Here, $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]}$ represents the activated protein $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ bound to the promoter.To develop a dissociation constant of this equation, we can write as: Now, in order to get an equation which describes the change in the concentration of mRNA with time we develop the following differential equation: where, $k_{on1}$ is represents the formation rate constant of the mRNA, and $gamma_1$ represents the degradation rate constant of mRNA.In Eq.(\ref{3}), $P_{exp}$ represents the probability that the promoter will be activated by the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$.The coefficient 2 represents the number of CO which bind to CooA; this number was taken from the literature.To develop a dissociation constant of this equation, we can write it as: Note that the concentrations of $\textrm{[CO]}$, $\textrm{[CooA]}$, and $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ are at equilibrium before the start of the reaction R1.The second reaction that takes place in our system is the binding of the activated activator protein complex of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ to the promoter Pr.(\ref{4}), we get: $$P_{exp} = frac{w}{z} = frac{frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}}{frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}+1} label{7} \tag{7}$$ As we want our $P_{exp}$ to be expressed in the terms of $\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$ separately instead of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$, we repeat these above equations by taking into consideration \ref{R1} and its dissociation constant $\textrm{KI}$.$$\textrm{[CO]}+\textrm{[CooA]} longleftrightarrow \textrm{[(CooA)2CO]} label{R1} \tag{R1}$$ The equation above represents the first reaction that takes place in our system in which the CO present in the environment is taken up into the cell where it binds to the CooA protein.(\ref{5}), we get: $$ z=w+1=frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}+1 label{6} \tag{6}$$ where, $z$ represents the total number of situations, $w$ represents the number of situations in which the promoter will be activated, and $1$ represents the number of situations in which the promoter will not be activated.Sustituting Eq.The initial condition for this equation was $\textrm{[mRNA(t=0)] = 0 molar}$.The analytical solution of this differential equation is equal to: Now that we have got the equation describing the change in concentration of mRNA, we can use the same method to derive an equation which describes the change in the concentration of the chromoprotein in time as following: $$frac{d\textrm{[CP]}}{dt} = k_{on2}.\textrm{[mRNA]}-gamma_2\textrm{[CP]} label{9} \tag{9}$$ Here, $k_{on2}$ is the formation rate constant of the chromoprotein and $gamma_2$ is the degradation rate constant of the chromoprotein.Figure 1: The central theme considered for mathematical modeling of CO system, where the chromoprotein DNA leads to the production of mRNA of chromoprotein and then subsequently of chromoprotein.(\ref{10}) is the final equation which describes the amount of $\textrm{[CP]}$ along with the amount of $\textrm{[mRNA]}$.1.(\ref{3}) it can be seen that the change in the $\textrm{[mRNA]}$ with time is equal to the difference of the formation rate of mRNA and its degradation rate.The initial conditions for the Eq.$\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$ concentrations inside the cell are constant.Table 1: Parameters, their description, and their values used in MATLAB simulation of CO-sensing system.Dissociation Constant of the binding of $\textrm{(CO2CooA)}$ to the promoter0.006 $\textrm{min}^{-1}$ / 0.0051 $\textrm{min}^{-1}$(\ref{8}) demonstrates, $P_{exp}$ depends only upon the concentration of $\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$.Only one molecule of the complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ can be bound to the promoter at a time.4.(\ref{9}), which is: $$\textrm{[CP]} = k_{on2}.frac{k_{on1}.P_{exp}}{gamma_1.gamma_2}(1-e^{-gamma_2t}) + k_{on2}.frac{k_{on1}.P_{exp}}{gamma_1(gamma_1-gamma_2)}(e^{-gamma_2t}-e^{-gamma_1t}) label{10} \tag{10}$$ Eq.$$P_{exp} = frac{frac{\textrm{[CooA]}.frac{frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}{1+frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}}{K_p}} {1+frac{\textrm{[CooA]}.frac{frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}{1+frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}}{K_p}} label{8} \tag{8}$$ As the Eq.Again, the initial conditions for this equation are assumed to be: which states that at the initial time, the amount of chromoprotein in the cell is equal to $0$.Here on forth, we will repeat the steps from Eq.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "However, even

nanoparticles.It is hard to imagine applying modern industrial methods as a solution for recycling the platinum in the soil of big highways.Here, the platinum catalyses oxidation and reduction reactions that neutralize toxic gases emitted during combustion.Platinum is a rare metal because there are only a few mines in the world where it can be obtained.Platinum concentrations are high in plants cause of the treatment of rainwater which is charged with metals et minerals.Platinum is a dense, malleable, ductile, precious and highly unreactive transition metal.The benefit of using the biosorption is to obtain nanoparticles of platinum, a highly valuable form of the metal.Thanks to its catalytic properties and remarkable resistance to corrosion even in high temperatures, it is a highly desired metal.Platinum is widely used in laboratory equipment, platinum resistance thermometers, electrical contacts and electrodes, medical equipment, chemotherapy, jewelry and etc.But most importantly platinum is used as the main catalyst in catalytic converters.An alternative solution to mining could help in the resolution of this issue.Concentrate the platinum accumulated in plants because of phytoremediation or in sludge in rainwater treatment centers.Secondly, there are no current methods of recycling platinum from accumulations in the environment that have been shown to work.Finally, there are also various socio medical complications associated with platinum mining.A modified FliC protein complex will be cloned into E. coli and enable the flagella of the bacterium so that it can bind platinum atoms.In fact since the 90s a legislation has been passed making platinum containing catalytic converters mandatory for all cars in most parts of the world.During the process of extraction huge amounts of hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used to eliminate impurities.Most importantly, platinum resources are draining.If we could exploit these systems and target platinum specifically enough, we could find a durable, simple, cheap and environmentally friendly solution.The main goal of our project is to concentrate the platinum as much as possible.The first step relies on the affinity of small organic molecules, siderophores, to bind solubilized Platinum atoms and thus favor the further solubilisation of more platinum compounds.As a second level of concentrating the platinum even more, we plan to use the principle of biosorption.", "design": "To counter this potential issue, we regulate transcription using the arabinose inductible promoter, pBAD/araCIt has to be noted that the siderophore here is specific for platinum but the same cloning could be performed with siderophores specific for others metals, thus our process presents a great potential as it can be applied to others metals thanks to synthetic biology and its modularity.Our strategy for the siderophore mobilisation results in two main steps\u00a0: Siderophores binding the platinum ions and others metallic ions1.A simple centrifugation of the flagellin binding the platinum allows to concentrate the metal a second time.? J. de Aberasturi, et al., Minerals Engineering 24, 505 (2011)? P.S Hooda & al.Moreover, any alternative has been found so far to counteract the disparition of this metal compared to its central importance in many industries (electronic, automobile, medical..) .Facing this problem, our goal here is to make a sustainable process, extracting platinum from an other source (road, sludge) than mines ressources, less pollutant, less expensive..Accumulation of the metal on the road side has been frequently shown since the beginning of the 21st century.Importation of the siderophore complexed with the platinum in StreptomycesBiosorption and reduction using flagellin and peptides Adsorption of the platinum on the bacterial surface, Capeness & al.Here, we use the adsorption potentiel of bacterial natural componants (specifically flagellum and biopeptides) to make a process able to extract or concentrate the platinum available on different compartiments like soil, plants, sewege sludge...  Maquette of our process in the futur\u00a0: Process has been imagined in a circular platinum economy based on the sludge treatment.Though, valuable ashes obtained would be treated by both steps we made\u00a0: the first one is a siderophore treatment making a first concentration of the platinum and other metals, the second one is a flagellin treatment allowing to make industrialisable platinum.To obtain a high transcription level of this sequence, we put transcription control under a strong promoter enabling a high flagellin production.Next, the flagellin produced will be added to the first concentrated platinum solution.During the automobile functioning, the precious metal is rejected and deposed on the road under a ionic form [2][3] Platinum leaching leads to an accumulation of this metal on the road side.Induction and production of the desferrioxamine B.Then, the produced siderophore would be purified and transfered in the recuperation solution containing the platinum and other metals.http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-012-0491-3.?

E. coli was used to produce this biobrick.To this end, we analyze the flagella sequences and structural properties of the external part of the flagella.", "human_practice": "This made us realize that many of the problems we had highlighted related to platinum have existed throughout the history of mankind: pollution, ownership of resources, work conditions, availability...We considered the implications for platinum and metals recycling our process could have, asked experts for advice and researched where it could fit in the industrial sector.This work can be found on the Integrated Practices page.The interactions we had here was really more focused in the scientific aspect of our project.As we investigated on the wide range of available techniques able to perform our purpose

process.Thanks to all those people we had very interesting interactions which contributed to the final shape of our project!Moreover our project was very well received by public and our conversations with people coming from different backgrounds was really motivating for us!We also shared our project with people more familiar with biology and biotechnology.Popularizing our project was really interesting and new for us because we had to find new ways to explain synthetic biology and our project.Moreover his recommendations has shape our project as we focused on the platinum recovery from sewage sludge which is a very advantageous process financially speaking.Finally we shared and did popularization on our project by attending to meetings, events and in medias (website, radio, local written press).We presented the synthetic biology toolbox to the general public, and talked about how it could be applied to solve environmental problems such as in those in our project.That why we contacted a expert in process engineering and biotechnology to advise us to determine the feasibility of our project.He showed us to what extend the situation could be critical about metals pollution, that why we found our project relevant.Hence he was really interested in our project we could have had fruitful conversations...The main question that we wondered was how to transpose our process initially designed on a laboratory scale to the industrial scale.We got advise from an expert in process engineering and biotechnology, to construct and define our process and to understand the current industrial possibilities available to biotechnology.We asked the University of Pretoria iGEM team to investigated for us the social issues and conditions of platinum mining, by interviewing experts.We had many fruitful conversations with an ecological engineer who advised us about the current situation and environmental pollution.We wondered if the different social issues around platinum were characteristic to our century and to what extent such issues could have mattered in the past.Thanks to him we have been able to assess and estimate representative values of our project applied on

parameters in equations 1 and 2 are the division rate$sigma (mathbf{z,c})$ and the partitioning function$p(mathbf{z,z ,c}) $.In their development $mathbf{z}$ and$mathbf{c}$ are considered to be

replication rate we propose, again following Shene et k_1 frac{mu (mathbf{z},S)}{K_1 + mu (mathbf{z},S)} ( z_{1_{max}} - z_1 ) & \text{if } z_1 geq 1.0 \\This relation, and equivalent one for plasmid number 2$dot{z}_2 (mathbf{z,S})$ is designed to satisfy the boundaryconditions of no reproduction if there is less than 1 plasmid in thecell, and a maximum copy number of $z_{1_{max}}$.To remainHere we assume that there is a fixed rate of division$sigma $ once cells are big enough to divide ($H[]$ is the Heaviside p(mathbf{z,z ,c}) = p(z_0,z _0) \times p(z_1,z _1) \times p(z_2,z _2) p(z_0,z _0) =

environment by a cell in state $mathbf{z}$ .Thus for a particular problem in hand it is necessary to chose$mathbf{z}$ and $mathbf{c}$ that represent the state of cells and themedia.The inhibition constant reduces plasmid replication rate at$\bar{dot{mathbf{V}}}(mathbf{z,c})$ rather than $\beta $ and$\bar{mathbf{R}}(mathbf{z,c})$.The bacteria beingindependant ensures that the behaviour of each individual depends onlyon its internal state $mathbf{z}$ and the conditions $mathbf{c}$ whichare the same for all individuals.mu &= mu_{0} \times e^{-frac{[Toxin]}{IC_{50}}} \\ mu &= mu_{0} \times min(1.0,e^{-k_a(z_1-k_bz_2)}) \\Incorporating 2 toxin anti toxin pairs, if we assumethat the production rate ratio is the same for both, $k_b$, is mu = mu_{0} \times min(1,e^{-k_a(z_1-k_bz_2)})) \times min(1,e^{-k_a(z_2-k_bz_1)}))where $mu_0$ is given by equation 3.These assumptions are probably the most suspectThis initial version of the model has no contention, that is $z_1$ and$z_2$ do not influence the growth rate $mu $.The aim of the model is to assess the evolution of plasmids throughout the culture, to determine which parameters can matter in the loss of those plasmids, and to precise what are the probabilities for a bacteria to loose its plasmids during cell division.As a plasmids can be a disadvantage for growth (energy spent into replicating processes) or a advantage (protection against a toxin) this question is hard to answer.We can see that with D increasing, corresponding to more bacteria growing, more bacteria tend to lose their plasmids and to have various numbers of plasmid.These results can be interpreted by the fact that if D is increasing, thus $\u00b5$ also increases, then bacteria grow faster, and divide faster.With small values of D, bacteria grow slowly and all plasmids have time to be replicated between each cell division.That is why for these values, most bacteria still have maximum values of plasmids and are all in the same situation hence the focusing of the plot for small values of D.If D is higher time for each bacteria to replicate their plasmids between each division is reduced, and the situation of each individual bacteria becomes different, explaining the scattering on the plot.A possibility is that we the genes produce toxin at a constant rate dependant on the numberof copies $k_1\times z_1$, the anti-toxin genes produce anti-toxin at a rate dependant on the number of copies $k_2\times z_2$, anti-toxin instantly and irreversible kills the toxin in a stochiometric manner.But in this situation, where one type of plasmid can influence on the presence of the other type of plasmid in (and reciprocally) in the same bacteria, the question become too tough to answer and only a mathematical model can resolve such a interrogation!In 1967 Fredrickson et al.The maturity parameter has a minimum value of 1 andFor the rates of change of the internal state vector then we propose forthe bacterial maturity to extend the development presented in Shene etal.Of course other factor have shown impact as replication rate of plasmids and the relative toxicity of each toxin.growth in inhibited in an exponential manner by free toxin with a characteristic $IC_{50}$.This model of toxin anti-toxin interaction takes into account thebacteriostatic nature of most such toxins, and the presence ofmeasurable $IC_{50}$ values.plasmids 1 carry the toxin A gene and the anti-toxin B gene plasmids 2 carry the toxin B gene and the anti-toxin A geneSo during the growth each bacterium can have no plasmids, either one type of plasmids, or both types.That cells divide exactly in half, thatis the maturity parameter is exactly halved when the cells divide($delta$ is a Kronecker delta function).The volume is well mixed so theconditions $mathbf{c}$ which are the same everywhere.This show that one of the main factor influencing the loss of plasmid is the growth of bacteria.", "notebook": "Transformation of DH5? cells

a large amount of Uricase may be needed to solve the problem of birds\u0092 dropping.We couldn\u0092t confirm this enzyme catalyzes uric acid into allantoin.The growth ability of the recombinant E. coli in minimal media containing uric acidGrowth test in minimal media of wild type E. coli and the recombinant E. coli were conducted to confirm Uricase activity which was expressed by the recombinant E. coli.In SDS-PAGE experiment, there is a high possibility that Uricase of B. subtilis was synthesized by the recombinant E. coli.The strongest band of lane 6 (less than 31 kDa) was not thought as uricase because of the difference from correct molecular weight (38.7 kDa).In addition, we tried?the purification by His-tag, only to fail (no purification product was seen) because that uricase from B. subtilis hardly dissolve in PBS buffer we used (shown above Figure)E. coli culuture were grown in the presence of IPTG.The result is shown in Figure.16 Even though the activity is lower than reagent Uricase, the activity of Uricase which expressed by our recombinant E. coli can be detected.In this project, we assayed mainly device BBa_ K2158004.However, in the growth test, the recombinant E. coli didn\u0092t grow well with uric acid.In determination of the recombinant Uricase, the result shows the possibility of expressed functional protein catalyze uric acid to allantoin.Then we put the proportionality constant as Kcat.Here, we estimated the two kinetic parameters Vmax and Km in the equation by fitting these parameters to a measurement result of the concentration change of uric acid in the reaction mixture.We performed growth test in minimal media containing purines of E. coli, B. subtilis, S.cerevisiae to confirm the existence of the target gene.The blue curve means the fitted curve, and the red plots is the data obtained from the experiment.The concentration of uricase as a standard reagent wasNow two kinetic parameters which is independent of concentration of enzyme or substrate (Kcat and Km) were estimated.Second, we conducted His-Link purification of protein and measured the absorbance at 280.0 nm to determine the concentration of uricase in the cell lysate.After that, we degraded urea and assayed the releasing ammonia by the method mentioned above.The growth tests in minimal media containing purines of B. subtilis , S. cerevisiae were performed.We attached the source code of this fitting tool below.In the following data and description, the unit of concentration of any substances is ng/?L and the unit of time is minute.First, we measured the change of concentration of uric acid in the reaction mixture.To acheive this goal, we manufactured E. coli that synthesizes uricase, which catalyzes uric acid to urea.In addition, we measured Uricase activity and concluded that there was a possibility that the synthesized Uricase has activity.However, Candida utilis has the gene coded uricase which has high enzyme activity.)Vmax is the conversion rate of uric acid under the condition that the ratio of the amount of uric acid to that of uricase is sufficiently high.E. coli culture was sonicated and diluted 1 to 100 times with the borate buffer.We could\u0092t understand why this incident happened.Determination of recombinant Uricase in the supernatant and the precipitationIn Figure.12, we considered that expressed Uricase is mainly in the precipitation.Yasuji Koyama, Toshio Ichikawa, Eiichi Nakano (1996) Cloning, Sequence Analysis, and Expression in Escherichia coli of the Gene Encoding the Candida utilis Urate Oxidase (Uricase).So, we cloned genes of uricase, allantoinase and allantoicase into E. coli to assess production and activity of these three enzymes.For this reason, the conversion rate of uric acid is described with the Michaelis-Menten equation.But we found that only Uricase derived from B. subtilis was in the recombinant E. coli .We performed PCR amplification of the genes coding these enzymes and cloned into E. coli.Uricase in this solution was synthesized by E. coli which we engineered.Uric acid in the reaction mixture may be catalyzed into allantoin.We combined Figure.13 and Figure.15.B. subtilis can degrade all of five intermediates of uric degradation described above.According to James and Rudolf(1984), wild type S. pombe is capable of degrading uric acid and allantoin.The result of the measurement is summerized in , Table.1 and Figure.11 .Then, we inputted these data into the parameter fitting tool mentioned above.So, we assayed Uricase in the supernatant and the precipitation of the sonicated cell suspension respectively and tried to verify the activity of the Uricase.Therefore, we are interested in \"How fast can our E. coli process uric acid theoretically?\"So, it is not clear that this protein has the function.We can utilize expressed enzymes without sonication.Schulz AC,Nygaard P,Saxild HH(2001)Functional analysis of 14 genes

were continuously measured.E. coli has a gene of allantoinase, and we can consider the possibility of affecting assay.(Protocols)The result of absorbance change is shown in Fig.15.We think IPTG didn\u0092t control lactose operon efficiently and the amount of the expressed enzyme was not enough to grow in the medium.We could extract genome from three kinds of bacteria, B. subtilis, S.cerevisiae and S. pombe and express three enzymes mentioned above.Meanwhile, this year\u0092s result is not enough to solve the pollution of droppings.In the city, deterioration of the landscape caused by birds\u0092 droppings is also a serious problem.Our goal of this project is to solve problems caused by birds\u0092 droppings with genetically engineered E. coli.Thirdly, each gene is cloned into B. subtilis instead of E. coli .So, we plan to solve these problems by expression of birds\u0092 \"dropping cleanerase\" and degrading uric acid.Purine metabolism is a pathway of synthesizing and degrading purines.If we use the gene coded uricase of Candida utilis by total synthesis, our project will improve more.Ammonia, the final product of purine metabolism, is the most assimilated nitrogen source of most fungi and bacteria.According to the sequence data, deletion of one base happened and it changed the reading frame in this composite part.Output of the parameter fitting was as follows.Besides, this graph shows the result of parameter fitting.As template genes of Uricase, Allantoinase and Allantoicase, we used four microorganisms.These crude extractions were diluted 1 to 100 times with the borate buffer.Ukai is a traditional night fishing method in which an \"usho\"(Cormorant Fishing Master) and \"u\"(cormorant birds) work together to fish by the flames of Kagari-bi (fishing fire lanterns) reflecting on the dark surface of the river, with Mt Kinka and lofty Gifu Castle on its summit providing a dramatic backdrop to the scenery.Furthermore, E. coli has a special anaerobic pathway to decompose allantoin into urea.The final concentration of the enzyme is 0.417 ng/?L.However, BBa_B0015 was not included in the plasmid.As expected, Bacillus subtilis grew well with uric acid, allantoin and ammonium sulfate.Uricase was cloned from B. subtilis and S. pombe.In Gifu prefecture, Cormorant Fishing on the Nagara river (Ukai) is one of the most summer sights in Japan.B. subtilis has eight genes driving uric acid degradation.However, it didn\u0092t grow well with w/o ammonium, uric acid and ammonium sulfate.0.5 mL of distilled water was added and the mixture was preheated at 25?.Cormorant is carnivorous animal, and the amount of uric acid in their droppings are larger than that of uric acid in other birds\u0092 droppings.We prepared 0.001% uric acid solution by dissolving in 50.0 mmol/L borate buffer containing 1.0 mmol/L EDTA and detergent(pH8.5).On the other hand, damage caused by the cormorant droppings at the riverside is serious in Japan.We assayed the degradation of uric acid by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 290 nm.In kegg pathway of purine metabolism in E. coli, it has HIU hydrolase and Allantoinase.We added 0.125 mg of urease in the reaction mixture.Birds\u0092 excrement consists mainly of uric acid which is hardly soluble material.No significant differences were observed in minimal media with 2 mM uric acid and w/o ammonium.Minimal media containing 2 mM urate or allantoin or ammonium sulfate as a sole nitrogen source and minimal media not containing nitrogen sources were also prepared.Firstly, we have to do more accurate assay using the allantoinase-loss-strain of E. coli.Cell suspensions were incubated at the appropriate temperatures for one day and spotted onto LB broth or YPD broth.A tool which estimates and outputs Vmax and Km by entering the measurement results of the concentration change was developed.E. coli culture was sonicated to assay the enzyme.The equation we made is as follows.d [uric acid] / dt = - Vmax * [uric acid] / (Km + [Uric acid])\u0085(A)([X] represents the concentration of a substance X.In woods on the riverside inhabited by cormorant, some leaves are stained with their droppings and interfered with photosynthesis.James R. Kinghorn, Rudolf Fluri (1984) Genetic studies of purine breakdown in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.So, we used B. subtilis and S. pombe in place of that.We couldn\u0092t verify the difference between E. coli with device BBa_K2158003 and wild type E. coli.So, we concluded the expressed Allantoicase didn t have appropriate function to degrade allantoic acid.Enzyme solution was mixed with buffer for allantoinase(50.0 mM Hepes, pH 7.75) containing 45.0 mM allantoin and incubated at 37?.", "design": "", "human_practice": "After the presentation, we conducted a field survey to check the circumstances of birds\u0092 droppings in Echizen city.The purpose of the questionnaires was to investigate how the High School students recognized about genetic recombination technology and synthesize biology.Furthermore, as a result of the after survey, there were many favorable opinions that they accept convenience and universality of the medicine using genetic recombination technology and synthesize biology.As a result of before survey Q1, Q2 and Q3, the recognition of the genetic recombination technology was very high, but the recognition of the synthesize biology was very low.In addition, when we compared the result of the before survey Q5 and the after survey Q4, we understood how students have impression of a product using the genetic recombination technology.In the field survey, we found some birds\u0092 droppings under some utility poles, but we weren\u0092t able to find the terribly polluted place.However, the city officer and local resident told that there were some polluted places and many wild birds in Echizen city few years ago.We were requested a presentation about the activity of iGEM Gifu by Ogakikita senior high school which is specified in the super global high school.At the lecture, many students asked about iGEM and genetic recombination technology.[shown in Project] \u00a0We made presentation at Ogaki Higashi High School and the natural science club of Gifu Kita High School.Survey of the Droppings damage in Echizen city, Fukui prefecture\u00a0In recent years, urbanization in Japan is advanced, so the environment has changed.The purpose was to get the recognition and understanding about genetic recombination technology and synthesize biology in the society.So, it is thought that the future problem in the study on synthesize biology is to prove the unknown risk, and to secure safety based on it.In the before survey, the favorable answer to food was 63%, cosmetics was 18% and medicine was 45%.However, in the after survey, the favorable answer to food was 50%, cosmetics was 18% and medicine was 83%.So, we thought that the season of our survey was not suitable.But, there were many opinions that they worry about safety for the food.We therefore made a presentation in Echizen city because we thought that our study could help to solve the problem.To give some basic background information, there are some places in Echizen city that are polluted due to birds\u0092 droppings.We should conduct the survey, when the wild birds were active.Survey of the damage associated with birds in Gifu cityWe confirmed whether the dropping (uric acid) is decomposed by the constructed E. coli which has a gene coding uricase.So, we found that the impression of genetically modified food was not so good in the society.Therefore, it has been an increase in the Droppings damage in urban areas.And also, high school students presented their study.The following graphs are the results of the questionnaires.And

however we decided to do a miniprep of the CUP1 codon optimized gene in order to do the restriction digest and gel the next experiment day.Copper measurements were taken through the use of a different plate reader.An overnight for the Ret1 transformed cells was done today to repeat the experiment at higher concentrations of copper.First meeting of the project over summer where we ran our PCR products on a 1% agarose gel for practice.Enough volume of the 0.1M Copper Solution was added to the 6 six flasks so each of the control and transformed group will have flasks containing a concentration of [0uM], [15uM] and [25uM].Discussion of the gel results and future plans on how copper measurement will be done.A gel was run on the transformed cells and control cells using Bullseye (left) and EtBr (right) to stain the DNA.We ran an SDS-PAGE gel using the samples collected from the experiment we did on August 19th.After realizing that the copper solution was interfering with our OD data, we decided to resuspend the cells in LB and use LB as our blank to gather the OD data.We ran an inoculation experiment using the cells with the CUP1 codon-optimized gene.Gel results showed no bands Digestion of the metallothionein plasmid with restriction enzymes (EcoRI & PstI).This gel showed a band in the Ret2 samples at a size of around 32 kDa, while our Metallothionein protein was expected to be around 6.5 kDa.The control plate had only a few colonies growing on it, even after a second attempt while the transformed had multiple colonies.We also ran two more gels with the experiment for Ret1 data.Another inoculation experiment was scheduled for today, however the tube of the overnight cells broke so instead a repeat of the overnight was done.After the optical density was read for the solution, the solutions were centrifuged and the supernatant in the eppendorfs were removed to be used for copper measurement.Repeated analysis of the digestion products on the gel.An overnight will be done tomorrow for the experiment on the following day.We noticed that we had to create different blanks due to the different copper concentrations that we did not do for the previous experiments.Since the Laemmli Buffer was nowhere to be found,the solution was spun down to be put in the freezer for the SDS gel in the future.Meeting with our advisor regarding current updates on the project and the availability of the flame atomic absorption spectrometer to be used for the copper measurement.Data was collected in the same manner except with a 30 minute time point after the one hour mark.Six flasks of 25 mL LB broth were prepared, 3 of which will be the control and the other will be for the transformed.We also discussed team structure and the CUP1 gene construct that is needed to be synthesized as a G-block.Based on the lanes with the least amount of noise (colonies 7 and 8), we transformed our competent cells using the DNA corresponding to those colonies.The control was spread on plates with ampicilin resistance and the transformed group was spread on plates with chloramphenicol resistance.To the transformed group 9.375uL of Chloramphenicol was added.The pellet in the eppendorfs were then resuspended with 200uL of master mix of Laemmli Buffer and were placed in the freezer to be used to run an SDS-gel in the future.At every hour for eight hours, starting at the 0th hour, an optical density reading will be taken for each flask.Drawing out 1mL of the solution from each flask into eppendorfs, followed by measuring the optical density.After further investigation, the Bulls-Eye solution was the cause of bands not appearing and we switched to Ethidium Bromide.iGEM team members attended a meeting with a professor and was given an overview to the procedure of 3A Assembly.7 uL of the Sigma Aldrich Wide Range Ladder (6-205 kDA) was added to the first lane while the other 10 lanes each contained 10 uL of samples from the experiment.From the second inoculation experiment, the eppendorfs were thawed on ice in preparation for the 10% SDS-gel.The second method uses a plate reader to measure the florescence of the sample.The second iGEM part, CUP1 codon optimized came in the day prior.The plate reader could not measure the florescence because there were no appropriate filters in the lab to emit higher than 700nm.Repeated digestion to troubleshoot any possible errors that may have occurred during the protocol.Today marks the first day we began production of our first cell line, Retriever 1(Ret1).The CUP1 transformed cells and control cells were plated and an overnight was done.The digestion products were then run on a gel stained with ethidium bromide.From Copper Sulfate, a stock solution of 0.5M Copper Solution was

family and friends for encouraging us when our experiments didn\u0092t work.", "background": "", "description": "Whereas if we do not provide the transporter and we provide the protease, the adhesion will be cleaved and the bacteria will disperse the biofilm.This allows to introduce genes for both the formation and the dispersion of biofilm under the control of an expression system that responds to a desired regulation.However, this will not be enough to ensure a non-dispersal biofilm, and definitely it will not ensure that the biofilm that is formed will be more robust and grow faster or higher than a regular biofilm, which is our main goal in order to obtain a strong and regulated biofilm for bioremediation purposes.In addition, as the system is inducible by an external signal, it will be easy to control the precise moment of the production, so the bacteria are not induced to produce when the biomass is still too low or they are not forming a biofilm.Thanks to the biobrick format, this project is modular, and different genes can be exchanged in order to consume or produce a wide variety of products, taking advantage of the biofilm properties.Finally, the demand of propionate is rising every year, therefore the biotechnological production of it would be an interesting option.However, this is only an example of what our production system could do, as it has a modular concept in which some of the parts can be exchanged.The following figure shows the genes that are necessary in order to produce propionate from the central metabolism:Figure 4.To manipulate this, we will make use of a phosphodiesterase (PDE), that will destroy the c-diGMP, and a diguanilate cyclase (DGC), that will produce it, YhjH and PleD* respectively.These four genes, lapC, lapG, yhjH, and pleD*, allow us to control the formation and dispersion of the biofilm, to enhance it and make it stronger, and to be able to induce it whenever we want to.In this way, we are going to put the biofilm genes under the control of a flip-flop system, in order to induce biofilm when we have enough biomass in the reactor, and disperse it at the end of the production cycle.Thanks to our modular system and the biobrick format, the genes for different metabolic pathways can be inserted in our biofilm-forming, glycerol-eating bacterium, in order to be able to produce any compound of interest.Propionate is the salt of propionic acid, which consists of three carbon atoms with a carboxylic group.Increase in the biodiesel production, which leads to glycerol accumulation.Because of this, we thought that it may be a good idea to feed our bacteria with glycerol.Besides, the dispersal could not be entirely satisfactory, as there exists a protein whose function is to retain LapG and prevent the proteolysis of the union of the adhesin.For these reasons, we decided to combine this control system with another one that regulated the biofilm in a metabolically level.The scpABC genes are obtained from an E. coli K12 operon, while the epimerase gene is obtained from Pseudomonas mosselii.As our final objective is to obtain an industrial strain that had all the abilities given by the different constructs, each of the constructs of this project needs to be expressed in a regulated manner, as it will be necessary to stablish a fine control.These constructions will be introduced in the genome of the bacteria by means of a miniTn7 device, a mini transposon that locates itself always in the same part of the genome, and that does not affect to the living conditions of the bacteria.The propionate genes will be under de control of an expression system inducible by salicylate.This bacterium is not able to form a biofilm, but if we provide a functional lapC gene, the accumulated adhesion LapA will be able to go out and the bacteria will be able to produce the biofilm.GlpK and GlpD are involved in the conversion of glycerol into molecules of the central metabolism.Once our bacterium can eat and use glycerol, the carbon and energy obtained from this source can be used to produce a wide range of compunds, such as plastics, propanediol, citric acid, propionate, or butanol.LapG is a periplasmic protease that participates in the biofilm dispersion process by cleaving adhesion proteins such as LapA.As we can see in the scheme, this molecule can regulate both the formation and dispersion of the biofilm, depending on the quantity of it that is present inside the cell.This flip-flop system is the same used five years ago by the team of our University, in which we have a first part that is induced by IPTG and a second one that is induced by an increase in the temperature.However, this adhesin is a really huge protein that has got several kilobases in the genome, and the genetic manipulation of it would be very difficult to achieve.Once we have that, we can improve the glycerol bioremediation!Glycerol is an alcohol of three carbon atoms, which is part of biomolecules such as phospholipids or triglycerides, and is also an important intermediate compound for the cell metabolism.There are two complementary systems; one depends on the di-c-GMP (DGC, diguanylate cyclase, and PDE, phosphodiesterase), and the other one controls the amount of adhesion proteins (LapC, which controls the LapA secretion, and LapG, which controls the LapA stability).LapA is the adhesin responsible of the adhesion of the bacteria to the surface during the biofilm formation process.This module includes the use of both structural and regulatory genes that participate in the biofilm formation cycles.This system will be implemented in Pseudomonas putida.The first idea that comes to our minds is that we can focus on the adhesin in order to detach the biofilm from the surface whenever we want it to be disperses, or give it to the bacteria from an inducible promoter to control the adhesion.It is widely used as a human and animal food preservative, as an intermediate in the production of plastics, pesticides and textiles, and also in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.It is present in the cells as propionyl-CoA, which is a product of the fatty acids beta-oxidation, and enters the central metabolism by being converted to succinate.This increase in the glycerol generation has led to a fall in prices and its accumulation (Figure 2).A lot of different products can be easily produced and secreted by the microorganisms, as propionate, plastics, butanol, citric acid...Our project is based on biofilms, communities of bacteria that protect themselves from external factors by an exopolysaccharides coat.This system is part of a cascade, that will highly increase the production of the different genes of the operon, allowing a huge production of the product we desire to obtain.In addition, it is also easy to perform deletion mutants in this species, fundamental to one of the branches of the manipulation of the biofilm.In the Figure 1 you can see the regulation system that controls the induction and dispersion of biofilms in Pseudomonas putida:Figure 1.We decided to modify Pseudomonas putida so it will form and disperse the biofilm at our will, and afterwards we have modified them in order to increase and optimise the consumption of glycerol, as well as introduce some genes in it so it can produce propionate.If we could find the way to increase its consumption of glycerol, we will be ending with a huge problem of environmental pollution, as well as feed our production system.For this end, we have produced a P. putida strain that has a knock-in with gene glpF.Pseudomonas putida is a GRAS (Genetically Regarded As Safe) organism, what means that it is completely safe, even for its release to the environment.Regulation of the biofilm formation and dispersion.LapC is an essential protein for the secretion of adhesion proteins (such as LapA) that are involved in the biofilm formation process.This bacterium already has all the genes needed for the assimilation of glycerol, but they are repressed in the absence of this molecule.This gene is an aquaporine that specifically helps to the entrance of glycerol inside the cell, as we can see in the Figure 3.Figure 3.ScpABC and Epimerase are the proteins which we will be using for our artificial pathway.We have designed an artificial way, which can be seen in the next figure.It is therefore urgent to find another way to use this product, so the excess of glycerol is removed from the environment and used in other industries.Some of the current options are its use in animal feeding or as a solvent for chemical and enzymatic reactions.By cloning glpF under the control of another promoter, this problem can be easily solved.This decision was made in order to have appropriate growing conditions.The glycerol genes will be under a constitutive promoter, as the objective is to remove the maximum amount of glycerol we are able to.Besides, its genome has been completely sequence, and there exist many useful tools to manipulate its genetics, as it is the case of the miniTn7 device.Propionate itself is only common in some bacterial groups such as Propionibacterium, which get energy from the propionic fermentation process.For this purpose, we used a molecular ON/OFF switch which is regulated by a simple compound, salicylate.A biofilm is a community of bacteria that have attached to a surface and between them, and that have produced an extracellular matrix made out of polysaccharides.This type of fermentation uses an anaerobic pathway using the inverse reactions of the Krebs cycle, and produces propionate from the central metabolism.Currently, propionate is produced by chemical synthesis.These four genes will be the responsible for the construction of the pathway.Figure 6.Metabolic pathway of the glycerol uptake and incorporation in the central metabolism.", "design": "When GlpF was produced from a salicylate inducible expression system, this strain reached higher growth rates than the wild type when using glycerol as the sole carbon source.On the other hand, we know that P. putida is able to form biofilms.Crude glycerol obtained from the biodiesel industry is constantly added to a continuous bioreactor, where it is converted to an useful molecule by action of biofilms.This way, we convert a waste to a useful molecule in a profitable manner.Other conversions systems have been developed in order to use the crude glycerol from the biodiesel industry.In order to take advantage of this ability of the biofilms to degrade glycerol in higher rates, we have also genetically modified this bacterium to control the formation and dispersal of the biofilm.The ultimate goal of this project is to have a bioreactor in which bacteria form biofilms on the surfaces of the tank when activated, consume glycerol (the input) and disperse at will when the bioreactor needs to be cleaned.For that reason, many researchers have focused on looking for new ways to use that crude glycerol and avoid its accumulation in the environment (for more information, see Integrated Human Practices).To help solving that problem, the UPO Sevilla Team has developed a modified bacterium that is able to assimilate glycerol in a most efficient way.Glycerol is a by-product of the biodiesel industry.However, we have increased the glycerol consumption by two complementary ways: by increasing the entrance of the molecule in the bacteria and by using biofilms.To solve that problem, we have integrated a gene coding for an inner membrane glycerol transporter in the genome of P. putida.That way, I hope to eliminate glycerol from the environment in higher rates compared to other conversion systems.For that reason, we have genetically modified this bacterium in order to increase the assimilation of glycerol.Metabolic pathway modeling performed by our team predicts that the limiting step for glycerol assimilation is its transport across the cell membrane.Using glycerol as a carbon source, bacteria can produce another molecule with added value.The need to search for alternative renewable energy sources and the increase in the biodiesel production has led to the release of large quantities of glycerol.We make use of Pseudomonas putida, a bacterium that is able to degrade glycerol.", "human_practice": "In this event, we did not only get to know the projects, but we also were able to appreciate the great work that the groups were doing.The initiative came from iGEM group of Valencia, who contacted us and the iGEM team from Barcelona.We felt really delighted and integrated when interacting with the different disciplines that make up a team, from biotechnologists and biomedical scientists or computer engineers, to a journalist.Thanks to this meeting of different teams, we all made good friends and we are now a great family where everyone helps each other.Our university conducted a workshop on legumes entitled \"Legumes, much more than a food\" located in Plaza Nueva, next to the City Hall in Seville.We took advantage of the occasion by distributing brochures with information about iGEM, about synthetic biology and about our project in an attempt to bring it closer to people who have no idea about this field.For us, the influence of people and their interest in new scientific projects is a huge breakthrough.During the event presentations from experts they were divided into the following sessions:It was a unique experience that allowed us to discuss our project and the way we conducted experiments with people experienced in the field.The European Researchers  Night is a European science project promoted by the European Commission within the Marie Curie Sktodowska the Horizon 2020 program, which takes place simultaneously in over 250 European cities since 2005.For the fifth consecutive year, it was held in order to enhance the human side of research through direct contact and conversation with experts.As we didn\u0092t know the city, our friends from Valencia were our guides and told us a lot of interesting historical information and some ancient legends of Valencia (such as the bat logo of the city).Another surprise was a picnic that the team from Valencia had prepared for all of us.Each part of the project was explained by a different member.It was very interesting to know the use of biomechanics and biomedicine to create transgenic plants using a novel and much more efficient technique .Our group was the second one to present the project.We talked about our project, and also explained the techniques we make use of to fulfil our goals.The scientific sessions took place in the hotel Silken Al-Andalus Palace.This event organized by the group of Molecular Microbiology of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM), has a totally educational and academic purpose.Apart from students, we were glad to explain our project to tourists, teachers and professors from different fields, parents, children and curious walkers.Although we belong to the Universidad Pablo de Olavide, this time we could have our own space due to the magnitude and recognition of our project.We were chatting for a few weeks until we agreed on a date for the meeting, which was not hard.The other groups gave them some ideas to help them improve their techniques.Once the presentations had finished, all group members met together and talked about what we thought about the other projects and how we could help each other.Sadly, we had to say goodbye at the train station.The 3 groups (UPO-Sevilla, UPF-CRG Barcelona and Valencia UPV) discussed constructively on different projects and applications and contributions to science.We had some very constructive talks for our projects and ourselves.After the presentations, all members of the group went out to have dinner together.They made a really fun show and we had a great time listening to their progress and difficulties on the creation of a probiotic to act as a preventive treatment for cancer.Specifically, the activity brought together more than 1,200 researchers to show their work to the public in the 2016 edition.We set up our stand next to the cathedral in the center of Seville, which is a really beautiful place.They were a little embarrassed to present their project because they thought it was not as good as the others.Until that time it was unknown to them, but now they are interested on our performance in the competition.As part of our meeting the IV Research Award BIOMEDAL a relevant research work in the field of Molecular Microbiology, as well as prizes for the best communications delivered.Several experts from the molecular microbiology sector participate in these meetings, making presentations on their work to help young researchers.This time the XI meeting was this time with Francis J.M.In these meetings, we combine the high scientific level of the Spanish Microbiology Society with an atmosphere of harmony and cordiality.Mojica (University of Alicante), who gave the inaugural lecture entitled \"The growth curve CRISPR\".Molecular Microbiology group is one of eleven specialized groups of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM), founded in 1946.It was a very nice surprise and the food was really tasty.In addition, we informed PhD students and other researchers about the iGEM competition.The purpose of the meeting was to know better the rest of the projects and the members from the other teams.On 30th th September, it was held on 7 Andalusian capitals and Jerez (Cadiz).The last year\u0092s edition had the participation of 250 cities in 32 European countries with the aim of bringing science and researchers to the general public, proving that science and research can be fun and that it also related to everyday life, and promoting science communication among young people.The commitment of researchers is key for the success of the activity, which records an increasing number of scientists and scientists participating in the event each year.Last August (18, 19 and 20), the three Spanish iGEM groups met in the city of Valencia.The Eleventh Meeting of the Molecular Microbiology Group of the SEM (Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Microbiologia) in Sevilla, took place during the days 6th, 7th and 8th of September 2016.We finished the exhibition with a Spot of Human Practices.Finally, it was the turn of UPF-CRG Barcelona.The tradition was started in 1996 and continued with great success at subsequent meetings of the Group.", "modeling": "Right: Visualization of program s output instants after the first cell division.How bacterial consumption of the limiting substrate affects cell and biofilm growthThe velocity in wich, at a given point in time, each cell grows in length is proposed to be:Where v is the length growth rate of the bacteria in question, k is a proportionality constant, p represents the limiting substrate consumption rate by the cell, and L depicts its length.Therefore, the length growth rate of a bacterium is inversely proportional to its length.Note: This is not a real visualization of the program s output but a diagram.As a result of equations 1 and 2 and Fick s diffusion, each bacterium in the biofilm grows at its own time-dependent velocity, to reach the critical length and divide.The bacteria in the program are attracted to each other and to the solid wall, to reflect the action of adhesins (i.e LapA), which are transmembranal proteins that enable adherance to form a biofilm.However, it exists simultaneously a certain repulsion force, to emulate in this way the superficial tension of the cells and wall (Figure 4).At the same time, the position of each cell is also affected by thermal agitation-associated diffusion.Limiting substrate consumption rate equation.Where pmax corresponds to the maximum length growth rate per bacterial length unit, S is the limiting substrate concentration in the area surrounding the bacterium, and M depicts the limiting substrate concentration at which half of the maximum length growth rate is achieved.To model that bigger cells would uptake more limiting substrate than smaller cells, equation 2 shows that p is linearly dependent on the length of the bacterium (L).In this way, they are considered cylindrical tubes of length ranging from \u0093L0\u0094 to \u00932L0 + ?\u0094, with semi-spheres of radius \u0093?/2\u0094 at both ends (Figure 2 left).The software predicts the growth in size of the initial bacteria over time, until the cells reach the critical length (\u00932L0 + 2?\u0094).One of the simulations consists in a microscopic prediction of biofilm growth.As v depends on p and p is dependent on L, it is necessary in turn for v to be inversely proportional to L (equation 1).Initially, the limiting substrate is evenly distributed in the three dimensional space.However, bacterial consumption creates gradients of the limiting substrate.Schematic diagram representing how the bacteria consume the limiting substrate in the sub-area they are located.The intensity of the color is proportional to the limiting substrate concentration.The reason is that, for the purpose of enhancing biological activity in a bioreactor, biofilm induction is a pillar in the project.Specifically, two kinds of simulations regarding biofilm formation have been performed.However, the simulation models that bacterial length growth (v) is indepedent from the actual length of the bacterium.At the same time, the software includes standard Fick s diffusion equations to incorporate how these mass gradients spontaneously tend to disappear.Equations determining bacterial position, where rj and r? j indicate the projections of the positions of particle j along \u0088 uj and along the directions perpendicular to \u0088 uj, respectively; Fj and F? j are the parallel and perpendicular components of the forces, respectively; and R, R? 1 ,R? 2, R? 1 , and R? 2 are independent Gaussian random numbers of variance 1 and zero mean.Visualization of the software s final output.This causes that sub-area to reduce its limiting substrate concentration, and limiting substrate diffusion from neighbouring sub-areas occur.Starting with one bacteria, a biofilm has been generated.The prediction starts modelling a 3D liquid space in which one or more bacteria are attached to a solid wall.That is, how regions (referred to as \"sub-areas\" in figure 3) where less limiting substrate is present incorporate limiting substrate from adjacent regions by difussion.This causes cells to grow at lower velocities in regions where less limiting substrate is present.", "notebook": "Now, we name the construction of pleD* as

also fulfill the two most important requirements in iGEM regarding biosafety: we only work with organisms from Risk Groups 1 or 2, and we completely avoid the release of genetically modified organisms and their products to the wild, by using containment protocols and sterilization of work material.These biofilm-forming bacteria will also be able to consume glycerol by expressing a glycerol transporter (glpF) with the same system, and they are also useful in order to produce many different compounds using that carbon source, such as propionate.Therefore, the main application of our bacteria is the industrial bioremediation and production of compounds.Our chassis bacterium, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, belongs to the Risk group 1 and is harmless and non-pathogenic for humans.The main risk about the use of a biofilm overproducing bacterium would be the transmission of biofilm production genes to other species, which could lead to the generation of highly resistant bacteria.The microorganisms we are using are not dangerous for human being, but there is a risk considering the presence of immunocompromised people.Therefore, the main actions we are taking are the containment of the biological material, the sterilization of the laboratory material, waste and work surfaces, and also to avoid the formation of aerosol particles that could lead to the spread of the bacteria.Our team registered two organisms in the check in, our main chassis organism (Pseudomonas putida KT2442) and Pseudomonas mosselii, from which we have obtained a part (epimerase) using gene synthesis technology.Responsible person for the safety of biology labs at our institution: Isabel Alonso Perez (+34 954977565, CABD).To avoid this, we do not use plasmid constructs, but our genes are stably inserted in the bacterial genome to avoid horizontal gene transfer, using the miniTn7 tool.The miniTn7 tool allows us to avoid many biosafety issues related to plasmid use, such as horizontal gene transfer or antibiotic selection (which can lead to resistance spreading); and it also makes our work much easier and simpler (avoids many problems related to plasmid stability, plasmid copy number and also provides the suitability to multiple bacterial hosts)If our project is completely finished and turns into a real product, the whole process can be developed in a biotechnological factory.Within the industrial applications, our modified strain is useful for the generation of products from bioremediation processes.You must read the safety specifications of the products you are going to use, including labels and safety cards.Keep the containers for chemical products closed and well organized.Avoid the inhalation of chemicals.This center belongs to the Spanish Public Administration and therefore fulfills all the national safety requirements.After we started our work, our team instructors and lab technicians provided us safety training.The use of lab coats and gloves is also mandatory in our lab.The UPO-Sevilla wet lab team uses the facilities of the Centro Andaluz de Biolog\u00eda del Desarrollo (CABD).This avoids biosafety issues such as the uncontrolled activity of exogenous genes and the harmful effect of an accidental release to the environment.Since we are working with genetically modified organisms, one risk is the release of these to the environment.Some of our safety guidelines are:Eating, drinking and smoking in the laboratories is forbidden.Use of security glasses, the use of contact lenses is not recommended.You must know the location and use of safety showers and fire extinguishers.", "keywords": "bacteriocins cementation TeamProtoCat antibiotics Acinetobacter propionate Description fluorescence recombinase

use all the while (potentially) turning a profit.Returning to the example above, linearly extrapolating on findings from a small proof-of-concept study on MDCs, by passing that same volume of water (approximately 1/8th the size of Sydney Harbor) through an MDC one could potentially produce energy on the gigawatt scale, all the while removing 90% of salt content in a single run-through.One of the UN\u0092s top sustainable developmental goals is universal access to clean water and sanitation.But with a rising world population and freshwater accounting for only 3% of the world\u0092s supply, there are many challenges still left to overcome in order to meet that goal.As briefly mentioned on our page for MDCs, clean water supply is one of the UN\u0092s top sustainable development goals.Though MDCs (like MFCs) typically rely on anodophilic and exoelectrogenic bacteria, by expressing shewanella-derived nanowires in our E. coli chassis, we are able to both greatly improve E. coli\u0092s aptitude for desalination and open the door for further study with the model organism.Since the 1970s however, the use of electrochemically active proteins, like seen in the Shewanella and Geobacter genera has removed the need for mediators and led to improved efficiency and net positive energy production.Additionally, whereas other energy sources (sustainable or not) tend to require some degree of complex oversight (consider the litany of redundant protocols involved in nuclear power production) MFCs are largely passive, with even the most \u0093high-maintenance\u0094 models requiring little more than a continuous inflow of fuel (think wastewater piping).We will also use Bielefeld\u0092s results as one of the benchmarks by which we will measure the success of our engineered E. coli.In 2013, Bielefeld\u0092s iGEM team conducted a project on MFCs, also looking at their efficiency and the lack of engineering on the biological side to the technology.Unlike these current methods, the \u0091hands-off\u0092 operation of MDCs with their free energy requirements make them accessible to both developed and developing countries alike.While MFCs used to have a reputation for inefficiency, this came largely in part from the misconception that chemical mediators were absolutely necessary to transfer electrons from bacteria to the anodes of fuel cells.Additionally, they designed (but did not test) one of the cytochrome complexes required for nanowire development.Barring the discovery of large underground aquifers or other improbable events, the most likely way to meet this goal is through water desalination.While there has been significant engineering involved in the electrode design and physical construction of MFCs, preciously little has been done on the biological side.Considering the prevalence of coal and gas fired power plants, it is not hard to see how many of these problems go hand-in-hand.Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) combine the technologies used in microbial fuel cell (MFCs) with those from electrodialysis systems to create low-cost, low-maintenance, and environmentally-friendly alternatives to current industrial desalination procedures.That is to say that even with the introduction of unconventional fuels such as wastewater, discarded foodstuffs, or compost, MFCs are capable of producing energy.The challenges posed by water desalination are in no way new and until recent years have been met with many methods equally \u0091historic\u0092 in nature.", "design": "Also, due to the ease of engineering E. coli, in the future, we can add to our system in order to handle several other aspects often involved in tertiary treatment, such as nitrogen removal, chlorine removal, [16] and antibiotic and pharmaceutical removal [17].Also, the physical design of the system could allow for reduced contact between our E. coli and water in order to achieve this partial removal of phosphorus.Our system would be designed in a way for easy removal of the E. coli from the wastewater in order to harvest the phosphorus for future work.[10] Therefore,our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli could be used to remove phosphorus from the water before the water leaves the outlet pipe.[5]Therefore, our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli could be applied to remove some phosphorus from the effluent after the effluent leaves the digester.This would increase the amount of nitrogen, the limiting nutrient in the effluent, that plants can use, and therefore, less effluent (and less excess phosphorus) would need to be applied.Adding to this design, we could create a compartment housing the bioreactor with modified E. coli for uptaking phosphorus at the contaminated source of water.Our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli would be useful during tertiary treatment of the wastewater treatment process.While the amount of phosphorus that enters the tile drain system varies with soil type and season, the researchers concluded that, based on similar studies, the observed relationship between phosphorus in tile drainage systems and watersheds are likely relevant for many other watersheds in the midwestern United States.[15] Our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli system provides another option for biological phosphorus removal in tertiary treatment.[5] \u0093Managing Phosphorus for Agriculture and the Environment,\u0094 PennState Extension.Excess phosphorus then accumulates on the soil, and surface runoff can carry phosphorus to bodies of water.[13] The Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies are requiring reductions in the amount of phosphorus in wastewater discharge [14].[18] T. Yamashita and R. Yamamoto-Ikemoto, \u0093Nitrogen and phosphorus removal from wastewater treatment plant effluent via bacterial sulfate reduction in an anoxic bioreactor packed with wood and iron,\u0094 International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, vol.This way, the effluent contains both necessary nutrients, but there would be less excess phosphorus.Results indicated that tile drainage accounted for 48% of the monthly dissolved phosphorus and 40% of the monthly total phosphorus exported from the watershed.The chemical removal of phosphorus involves the formation of a precipitate by the addition of metal salts.While a small amount of phosphorus settles to the bottom of the digester, the rest of the phosphorus is in the effluent.Some of the ammonium is released as ammonia gas, and the rest of the ammonia will be incorporated into the soil, where microorganisms convert it to nitrite and then nitrate, the form in which most plants uptake nitrogen.[14] Environmental Protection Agency, \"Advanced Wastewater Treatment to Achieve Low Concentration of Phosphorus\", Office of Water and Watersheds, Seattle, WA, 2007.[8]While tile drainage systems are beneficial due to their ability to increase crop yields and reduce surface runoff, they also are problematic due to their export of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides, such as atrazine, into waterways.[6]) Therefore, ammonia in the effluent will not be released as gas, and microorganisms in the soil can convert the nitrite to nitrate.[9] An eight-year study on six different tile drains and a watershed outlet within the Upper Big Walnut Creek watershed in central Ohio concluded that tile drainage systems\u0092 contribution to phosphorus in surface water is not negligible, as previously thought.Tertiary treatment refers to any additional treatment after secondary treatment, and this often involves removal of impurities and nutrients, such as phosphorus.[2] S. M. Mitchell, N. Kennedy, J. Ma, G. Yorgey, C. Kruger, J. L. Ullman, and C. Frear, \u0093Anaerobic Digestion Effluents And Processes: The Basics,\u0094 Washington State University Extension, FS171E, pp.Another major nutrient for crop, nitrogen, is also present in the effluent, although some of the organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium.[10] K. King, M. Williams and N. Fausey, \"Contributions of Systematic Tile Drainage to Watershed-Scale Phosphorus Transport\", Journal of Environmental Quality, vol.[15] Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, \"Phosphorus Treatment and Removal Technology\", Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, St. Paul, MN, 2006.An effluent containing most of the nutrients in manure passes through the digester and is collected for use in fields.About 25% of farmland in the United States and Canada uses tile drainage because over-saturated soils provide insufficient aeration and thus inhibit crop growth.The annual flow-weighted mean for dissolved reactive phosphorus in tile drainage systems was 0.12 mg/L, and the annual flow-weighted mean for total phosphorus in tile drainage systems was 0.15 mg/L.Our system would be designed to attach to the end of the outlet pipe.This is a problem because when cow manure is used as fertilizer, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient.Also, we would add genes (based on Nanjing-China\u0092s 2013 iGEM project) to our E. coli to absorb and degrade atrazine.[2] The methane gas is then collected for use as bioenergy.By placing trzN downstream of the ribosome switch, we would only produce trzN when necessary.The precipitate, and therefore the phosphorus, can then be removed.[4]Still, most of the nutrient content from the manure stays in the effluent.[11] Also, in the future, we could work on developing a genetic system for nitrogen remediation to incorporate into our E. coli.The phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) then store 5 to 30% of their dry weight as phosphorus.Our system can also be adapted for nitrification, converting ammonia to water soluble nitrite, by adding the genes for ammonia monooxygenase (BBa_K1067003), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase(BBa_K1067004), and cytochromes A and X (BBa_K1067002).", "human_practice": "Coming away from this meeting we began to focus more on design criteria such as how much phosphorus we needed to retrieve, began looking at products that already existed, and broadened our scope of potential application.They gave us feedback and information we would need to provide them in order to pitch our product on an industrial scale.From the outset of our project, we understood that we would receive pushback regarding the use of E. coli in water.Based on advice we received, we made posters to explain our project and set up a booth at the Wabash River Festival in West Lafayette to discuss the phosphorus problem, our solution, and what it means with people at the festival.He also encouraged us look into the phosphorus cycle and see where our Implementation could have the largest impact.Additionally, Andi provided us with information on 2 stage ditches as both an alternative method of phosphorus reclamation and as a potential area for application of our method in conjunction with the ditches.From this discussion, we widened our focus to the entire phosphorus cycle, started looking at mass balance systems for phosphorus, and set up meetings with people involved in various stages of water cleanup like the USDA lab on campus, the Lily Nature Center, and the West Lafayette Waste Water Treatment Facility.He also talked to us about his work with phosphorus, which gave us insight into our design.He encouraged us to focus on the larger context of our potential solution; focus on the mass balance of the system, energy usage, environmental impacts, and the entirety of the water cycle.As we did more research, we found that these beads were ideal for our project as the E. coli would be unlikely to escape and would be viable for up to 4 weeks.Below you can find specific design or direction changes we made based on our meetings.After discussions with scientists and businessman at DAS, we decided to talk to policy experts in the government.As Purdue President Mitch Daniels said, \u0093It\u0092s only innovation when it is useful to someone.\u0094At this meeting with the USDA we narrowed down design criteria for a prototype phosphorus reclaim module.This prompted us to return to the USDA to talk about the specifics of phosphorus application and the sustainability of current farming practices.This started a dialogue with the public and gave us valuable insight on further communication and presentations.Our next stop in our discovery was the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Lab.We resolved to design our system in such a way that the phosphorus was tightly held but also easily removable.We then held a design meeting in whoch we iterated to find a design that the USDA would develop for us.Andi Hodaj discussed tile drains in depth and gave us good information on how we could implement a phosphorus reclamation module within one.This information again broadened our thoughts on potential application and gave us enough information of tile drains to begin brainstorming a potential prototype.We met with the Chief Science Liason of Bindley Biosicence Center, Dr. Thomas Sors, who was very helpful throughout our project.Additionally, they discussed tile drains as a potential area for application of our system and encouraged us to attend Andi Hodaj\u0092s thesis defense.We attended a seminar on phosphorus given by Dr. Kevin King in which he talked about the \u0093stickiness\u0094 of phosphates.We set up a conference call in which we discussed our early ideas for a phosphorus accumulating E. coli that could be used on agricultural fields.Most importantly, he talked to us about system modularity, which led to us designing our system so that many different projects could utilize it.We were lucky in our discovery process to stumble upon the 2016 Midwest Clean Energy Forum that was held on campus.We talked to one of our advisors who recommended we speak to Dr. Jay Garland at the EPA.This helped us meet some of the design criteria that we arrived at with other experts.Our first visit was to Dow AgroSciences (DAS) where we presented our still rough project idea.He explained that this contributes to a buildup of phosphates in the system that doesn\u0092t happen with nitrogen.However, we learned that limestone is ineffective as it leeches phosphorus after sometime.More importantly, we started to look into possible ways to ensure safety in using E. coli to clean up water.", "modeling": "Figure 4: Concentration profiles of intracellular phosphate at equally-spaced time points in the model.Figure 3: Concentration profiles of extracellular phosphate at equally-spaced time points in the model.Two meshes are then defined: one to model phosphate concentration outside of the cells and one to model phosphate concentration within cells at all linear positions within the bioreactor at all time points for the length of the model (total running time is a preset parameter).The concentration is normalized to the instream concentration of phosphate.Additionally, the average intracellular concentration of phosphate across all cells in the bioreactor is calculated and plotted against time (Figure 5).The cells reach their maximum capacity of phosphate sooner as the flow rate slows.The overall bioreactor efficiency was also calculated at various flow rates (Figure 8).Figure 8: Bioreactor efficiency over time at various flow rates (0.5 mL/s, 1 mL/s, 5 mL/s, 10 mL/s, and 50 mL/s).As the concentration nears the maximum, the uptake rates slows and the reactor efficiency drops.To determine the overall efficiency of the reactor, the exiting concentration of phosphate is divided by the original, instream concentration, and plotted against time in Figure 6.The effect of flow rate on the bioreactor was evaluated by simulating various flowrates (Figure 7).Figure 7: Effect of flow rate on phosphate uptake over model simulation time.This assumption is valid because the genes are designed to be under constituitive control, resulting in a steady-state concentration of the membrane transport proteins.Concentration profiles of phosphate at various time points are seen in Figure 3.The profiles indicate a noticeable difference in uptake rates at various points in the reactor over time.Similarly, concentration profiles across the reactor of phosphate within the cells are plotted in Figure 4.To purpose of the model is to inform design regarding the viability of the PAO system, particularly to predict how long a single PAO reactor is useful before needing to induce the phosphate export subsystem.An analytical model using finite difference methodology was developed to predict performance of our phosphate uptake system over time.Where Cout is the extracellular phosphate concentration at position x and time t, Cin is the intracellular phosphate concentration at the same position x and time t, Cmax is the maximum phosphate capacity of the cells, and k is the phosphate uptake constant.The reactor peaks at 83.7% efficiency before decreasing as the cells near their phosphate capacity.This plot embodies the usefulness of the model, as the reactor efficiency is a measure of system performance.The concentration is normalized to the instream phosphate concentration.The concentration is normalized to the instream concentration of phosphate.The plot shows the accumulation of phosphate of the entire bioreactor over time.The maximum phosphate capacity of each differential volume slice is determined with cell density and maximum phosphate capacity per cell using Equation 4.The cellular concentration is assumed to be 108 cfu/mL and the phosphate concentration per cell is assumed to be 4*10-14 mol/cfu.Given that the width of the annuls is 0.7 cm and the flow rates are relatively low, the shear stresses are unlikely to create a large velocity gradient.It is assumed that the uptake coefficient remains constant throughout all position and time points in the model.Third, relevant parameters, namely the instream phosphate concentration, are pulled from the literature.Future iterations of the model would rely on experimental data to get a more realistic value for k, the phosphate uptake coefficient.The model is then run over the preset time parameter.Future iterations could also inform the value of k further and explicitly define it as a function of plasmid copy number, promoter strength, and other factors.pPerCell = 4E-14; % maximum phosphate concentration per

efficiency, a flow rate of 1 mL/s provides the longest lifetime of the reactor.Preliminary modeling of the system has provided a general idea of the system performance and how often filters would have to be changed for effective operation.Performance of the system was predicted using a finite difference model.It is assumed cell growth over the time course of the model is negligible and therefore is not accounted for.It is assumed flow velocity is the same at all radial positions in the reactor (perfect plug flow).The differential volume is calculated based off of the volumetric flow rate (Q) as seen in Equation 3.This enables the creation of a mesh such that an entire differential volume is moved through over the course of the discrete time step.", "notebook": "0.5\u00b5L MgCl2 was not added

transformations from yesterday, and the production of more LB agar plates with ampicillin closed out the week in Bindley Bioscience Center.This garden needed some weeding and re-planting to be in tip-top shape again.THURSDAY, JUNE 16Team members were busy in the lab completing transformations of phosphorus genes, more PCR, autoclaving, and inoculation of transformed InterLab genes.In the afternoon, a few team members also visited the West Lafayette Wastewater Treatment facility, where they learned about the local area\u0092s methods for phosphorus removal featuring their newly-implemented chemical system.THURSDAY, JULY 29Additional trials of media and various water samples were run on both the lachat and ICP as team members were trained in their use.Work continued on both the spring publication and protein profiles for the wiki.WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8 Formal lab meeting #1 was a success with the most highly prioritized goal for the upcoming week to find or generate relevant numbers for the project including necessary flow rates for a microbial fuel cell, an appropriate density of E. coli within it, etc.Further testing of the prototype will include the determination of the proper substrate to contain E. coli, optimum temperature and pH, and best water flow rate.THURSDAY, JULY 14Thursday morning began with celebration as all of the previous day\u0092s transformations worked with multiple colonies appearing on every plate.Young scientists tried their hands at pipetting, mixing colored water in eppendorf tubes.MONDAY, JULY 11After a successful weekend participating in the Wabash River Fest, the team jumped back into lab work, plating a new culture of Shewie, miniprepping a promoter for use with digestion the next day, and preparing glycerol stock cultures of successfully transformed parts.Exeter and UChicago are onboard to help with database entries and protein characterization, and SVCE will distribute a survey about wastewater management practices.Through a meeting with Dr. Ron Semmel, a Monsanto scientist, the team acquired useful contacts and information regarding local phosphorus and nitrogen soil concentrations.MONDAY, MAY 23Day 1 on the job\u0096the morning began with a tour of Bindley Bioscience Center for the new interns (Barrett, Caleigh, Emma, and Paige), during which Susan (the

for the official iGEM project wiki and a project timeline were completed in addition to an establishment of a protocol for completing lab notebooks.The day also brought continued research into the development of a model to both inform experimental decisions and make future predictions.FRIDAY, JULY 22During the week, the team found out that IDT was unable to synthesize another nanowire gene, cancelling the order and decisively tabling the wet lab work for the nanowire side of the project for this competition cycle.Look for explanation no further than the team\u0092s newly-released glossary of synthetic biology and iGEM terms hosted on the Experiment page.With the new bioreactor prototype, several protocols needed to be written including a standard for measuring water flow and a process for system maintenance.PCR products included Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK1 homolog part 1, PPK1 homolog part 2, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.PCR products included Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK1 homolog part 1, PPK1 homolog part 2, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.If lab work continues to go well, this may be something to pursue in the fall.TUESDAY, JULY 12Wet lab work consisted of the digestion and ligation of all three remaining phosphorus genes in preparation for transformations into E. coli.Performed transformations for both the 3:1 and 6:1 (insert:vector) ligations of Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.It involved the creation of a guide for phosphorus on the Experiment page, so if you want to become familiar with the differences between total phosphorus, orthophosphate, and polyphosphate, feel free to check it out.THURSDAY, JULY 21The lab hosted Peter Oladipupo, a Mandela Washington Fellow, answering questions regarding the project as it relates to the generation of energy.With equipment, it is possible to operate without reliance upon the lab space of other Bindley Bioscience Center scientists, lending additional flexibility to the projects iGEMmers are able to complete.Phosphorus genes arrived, and the team got to work on PCR amplification in the afternoon.Wiki design was also discussed to get this critical project element up and running ASAP.TUESDAY, JUNE 14Lab work for Tuesday included the mixing of gels for later electrophoresis, the miniprep of promoters that were PCR\u0092ed previously, and continued InterLab transformations.WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15Meeting day!Project write-ups for the Experiment campaign were completed, as was an application for a grant from SYNENERGENE for advanced human practices.THURSDAY, JUNE 2The Experiment online crowdfunding platform was submitted for approval in the morning, and an order for both competent cells and primers was placed.Bacterial growth was only present on the positive control, and all the transformation results came back negative.Digested Anderson promoter J23106, the ATP-independent PPGk, and PSB1A3 for 3A assembly.Ligated J23106, ATP-independent PPGK, and PSB1A3 together.Inoculated two samples of E. coli with the plasmid PBR322 and one sample of E. coli with the plasmid PACYC4 into LB.Performed minipreps on two cultures of E.

two sequence-verified transformations into PSB1A3 (PPK2 homolog C and PPX2 homolog) into LB-ampicillin.Practice minipreps were next on the agenda, which the interns also completed successfully in addition to some supply inventory.TUESDAY, MAY 31Lists of supplies needed for various assays were assembled, and an assessment of necessary ordering was made, thus finalizing the functional assays to run for both nanowire and phosphorus genes.Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog were all successful.The gel was run at room temperature and at 90 V. Bands representing the expected DNA length were present for PPK1 homolog part 2, PPX2 homolog, and PPK2 homolog C. Performed gel electrophoresis of PCR products on 1% agarose gel.If I can\u0092t kill them, they go to market.\u0094TUESDAY, JULY 5Returning from holiday, the team worked into the week with a couple of collaborative Skype calls.The conclusion of a successful first week!MONDAY, MAY 30Memorial Day was an optional day on the job, but the dedicated iGEM team put in an afternoon of work in Bindley.E. coli were added to the beads to determine whether or not they would be able to survive within the structure.WEDNESDAY, JULY 27Based on results from the lachat and ICP and the discovery that E. coli would not grow in the originally proposed Tris-HCl buffered solution, the measurement of phosphorus uptake protocol was modified after a productive meeting with advising scientists.After digestion and ligation, they did some gel electrophoresis, as well, running several different samples.MONDAY, JUNE 13Most significantly this week, team members hosted Molecular Agriculture Summer Institutes (MASI) high school students in the lab as they worked with Emma on completing InterLab protocols [InterLab is an iGEM-wide study working to establish a consistent unit of measurement for fluorescence; experimentation and measurement is completed using GFP.]The gel was run at room temperature at 90 V. Bands indicating product were present for Pit homolog A, Pit homolog C, and PPK2 homolog C.

the campaign launches June 9!MONDAY, JUNE 6Monday morning got rolling with the attendance of ABE PhD student Dr. Andi Hodaj\u0092s thesis defense regarding two-stage ditches as a tool to reduce nutrient loads.The bacteria will be immobilized within the matrix of silica fibers while phosphorus is still able to pass through, making this solution ideal for easy input and retrieval of E. coli from the bioreactor system.Interns learned how to optimize codons using IDT both automatically and manually, checking for segments such as EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI, and HINDIII that should not be present in coding regions of constructs, as these sequences code for restriction sites.WEDNESDAY, MAY 25 A review of sterile technique and iGEM kit DNA extractions in the lab comprised a majority of the morning.Phosphorus is to be collected in these chambers, and effluent is controlled by the valves at the point where water flows from the filters.It was discovered that the facility is newly permitted for phosphorus removal; however, a chemical method as opposed to a biological one will be implemented August 1 for both political and financial reasons.PCR was completed for 3 phosphorus genes whose gel electrophoresis analyses were unclear when attempted over the weekend.An afternoon Skype call with the University of Exeter in England topped off the day as teams exchanged greetings, project synopses, and ideas for future collaboration.FRIDAY, JUNE 24A Shewanella oneidensis culture, generously donated by Argonne National Laboratory, arrived amidst great celebration on Friday morning.Here\u0092s a quick summary of the goings-ons in short paragraph form:The team visited Imagination Station in downtown Lafayette regarding the possibility of volunteering both this summer and continuing forward.Corresponding with this endeavor, many bottles of Tris-HCl buffer, the media in which phosphorus-eating E. coli will be suspended, were created and autoclaved for future use.TUESDAY, JULY 26The week continued by learning to make methanol-free bioencapsulation beads using the sol-gel method.Thank you to everyone who has aided our cause!MONDAY, JUNE 20The week began with a strong focus on human practices as the team fleshed out 3 ideas.It was great fun for all parties involved as passersby learned about DNA, built (and ate) their own licorice and marshmallow double helix models, and asked questions about synthetic biology and the phosphorus cycle.With all phosphorus genes successfully transformed, the team can now move forward with characterizing proteins.A reporter from local WLFI 18 TV news visited the lab, as well, and the story, related to Florida\u0092s algal blooms, aired on the nightly news.Purdue\u0092s two-stage ditch utilized in Dr. Hodaj\u0092s was established in 2012 and drains 660 acres; it may be a possible implementation point for the project\u0092s biological method.After practice forming the beads, the team switched to a different method that could be more easily controlled and manipulated.This week, culture growth will begin after air tanks to sustain the anaerobic culture arrive.TUESDAY, JULY 19Mid-week discussion centered around using the sol-gel method to suspend E. coli in silica beads with which to fill containers external to the main containment area of the bioreactor.The team has been trying to find the proper ratio of these two ingredients so beads solidify at an appropriate rate\u0096too slowly, and an amorphous silica blob forms in the bottom of the mineral oil into which the beads drop; too quickly, and the mixture hardens inside the tubing through which it is dispensed.Analytical labs, rain-producing machines for the purpose of studying erosion patterns, bioreactors, and anaerobic growth chambers were among the cutting-edge technologies the team observed.Tweet @PurdueBiomakers to let the team know what you think.MONDAY, JULY 18In collaboration with Exeter, the team will be growing up last summer\u0092s killswitch genetic construct under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.In the best interest of keeping a sterile work environment, the team refrained from strewing confetti across the bench, although it would\u0092ve been both fun and festive.Dow AgroSciences generously donated various lab supplies to the iGEM workspace that the team was thrilled to pick up in Indianapolis on Friday morning.The plan for the upcoming week is to characterize individual proteins and begin conducting tests to determine the optimal substrate for E. coli to inhabit in the bioreactor\u0092s external chambers.They are excited about the project and are looking into Chicago-area venues as the Purdue team investigates Indianapolis as a potential host city.The remainder of the day was spent working on gene design via Benchling, researching potential assays, and meeting with Drs.Additionally, the team is excited to announce that their submission for a SYNENERGENE Grant-Funded Collaboration proposal was selected!The gel was run at room temperature and at 90 V. Performed digestion and ligation (both 3:1 and 5:1) on the Anderson promoter J23106, six of our phosphorus-related genes, and PSB1A3.Transformed the six phosphorus-gene constructs ligated yesterday into E. coli, .Nanowires will be revisited during the school year\u0096strong side project potential!MONDAY, JULY 25Preliminary trials of testing for phosphorus using the lachat and the ICP-OES at the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory began.The rest of the afternoon was spent working on action items from the meeting and printing the spring publication, which is FINISHED.THURSDAY, JUNE 9Team members Barrett Davis, Paige Rudin, and Suraj Mohan attended the Regional Clean Energy Innovation Forum held at Ross-Ade Stadium.If this event is pursued, it would be a day-long conference at the end of July.The third idea is in regards to the Great North American Skype Series (G-NASS), a \u0093Skype roulette\u0094 to foster inter-team communication.Cool temperatures slow the reaction, so the team has also tried completing the process in the cold room with mineral oil warmed on a hot plate, but to no avail.Some golden rules of sterile technique: Always wipe down the lab bench with 70% ethanol before beginning; work as close to the flame as possible, as it creates a sterile \u0093bubble\u0094; and get into and out of pipette tip boxes as quickly as possible to keep them sterile.Interns followed an existing protocol to make plain LB agar, LB agar with ampicillin, and LB broth, culminating in the pouring and storing of too many plates to count.Additionally, the team met with representatives of the Purdue Foundry regarding the possibility of developing a business model for the phosphorus removal system.See last week\u0092s previous post for more information; the Experiment page can be found here.The first, iNAC, the iGEM North American Conference, was sparked by the observation that many more European than North American teams medal, and of those that medal, the proportion of golds is substantially higher for Europe.The theme the team took away from the day is best summarized with the words of Purdue President Mitch Daniels during his opening remarks: \u0093It\u0092s only an innovation when it\u0092s useful to someone.\u0094 How can new technology of nanowires and microbial fuel cells be integrated efficiently into established systems?Additionally, the hunt for assays continued for both phosphorus and nanowire constructs.The lachat measures orthophosphate, or soluble reactive phosphorus, while the ICP measures total phosphorus, the entirety of phosphorus contained in a sample.Due to low concentrations below 45 ng/\u00b5L, the colonies containing these plasmids were reinoculated.Performed minipreps on two cultures of E. coli containing the plasmid PBR322 and one sample of PACYC4.A graduate student in the lab worked with team members to describe and demonstrate the protocol.Transformations were done into E. coli.Inoculated transformations of the temperature sensitive promoter K608351 and tsPurple reporter (RBS+coding+terminator) K1357008 into LB-chloramphenicol.Inoculated successful transformations from October 9 into LB- chloramphenicol.", "protocol": "in a hood or near a flame) do NOT use heat to dry the smear because cells might popOnce dry, pass slide through a flame 1-2 times to fix cells to the glass slideEnsure the cells do not come into contact with the flame, only the underside of the slide (slide should be just hot enough that you can hold it in your hands without causing burns)Completely cover the smear with Solution 1 for 30 seconds and rinse for 1 sec with ddH2OCompletely cover the smear with Solution 2 for 1 minute, rinse well with ddH2O and blot dry.Examine under oil immersion using the 100X objective with brightfield illumination (do not use phase contrast)If using EVOS, do not use any fluorescent illumination--natural light will workWritten up by Barrett Davis, Emma Foster, and Paige RudinTo prepare E. coli cultures for phosphorus uptake characterizationGrow up cells in LB Broth with shaking at 37\u00b0C for 12h (25 mL)Pipette 100 uL into a well;

dissociating from the column while washing away contaminants.The final heated solution should be clear and colorless (no agarose powder should be visible).Add 3 ?L SYBR Safe in the 30 mL molten gel with 1:10,000 dilution.1X TAE can be prepared from the 10X TAE concentrate (a common lab resource).Add the 30 mL of 1X TAE into the flask containing the 0.21g of agarose powder.Amp- 100 micrograms/ml, Cm- 35 micrograms /ml, Kan- 50micrograms/ml, Tet- 5 microgram/mlInnoculate with the required amount and incubate the flasks at 37 degrees and 220 rpm.Each morning and evening, take the OD of the culture and add to a fresh flask as before to reach a starting OD of 0.05 again.Residual agarose will solidify quickly in the flask.Let the solution cool and solidify into a gel.If you have multiple bands, you might have to optimize the PCR protocol or gel extract the correct band or both.After you figure out the optimal PCR conditions, you can do more than one 50 uL reaction to keep as stockDon t use all of the original G Block stock.If a sample volume is greater than the column, perform multiple applications and centrifugations until the entire sample has been processed.Note: Use 2.0, 15 or 50mL centrifuge tubes for the 0.2, 1 and 3mL spin columns, respectively.Calculate the amount of overnight culture you need to add to get a starting OD of 0.05 in 50 ml of mediaPut 50 ml of the media (one of LB and one of No salt LB) into 250ml erlenmeyer flasks and add antibiotics for the control you are using to the recommended iGEM concentration.This will keep the culture going.Take a sample from the culture and make a glycerol stock using 0.5ml of sample and 0.5ml of 50% glycerol every day in week 1 and every two days in week 2 (this is what we are doing if it\u0092s too much then however is fine).An electric field can be used to pull DNA through an agarose gel matrix because the phosphate backbone in DNA is negatively charged.Centrifuge the column at 700 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes and collect the flow-through in a centrifuge tube.Wash resin with two resin-bed volumes of Wash Buffer.A molecular weight marker (DNA ladder) containing DNA fragments of known length can be used to determine the size (in base pairs) of the DNA samples run on the gel.If it is orange or purple, add 10 uL 3M sodium acetate until the mixture turns yellow.Then, add one mL of the prepared sulfuric acid solution and 0.4 grams of ammonium persulfate to the solution.Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg gel ~ 100 uL).The migration rate of the DNA fragments will depend on the density of agarose in your gel.Collected solution at the bottom of the tube is the purified DNA.When the flask is cool enough to hold add antibiotic, pour into plates, and let cool.Take 300 \u00b5l of the aqueous phase in a fresh test tube.Elute His-tagged proteins from the resin by adding one resin-bed volume of Elution Buffer.The top of the cell containers should be marked to show use, and each Eppendorf tube should be labeled with the part name of control.Add to the Erlenmeyer flask.Add 1 drop phenolphthalein indicator.The digested sample is then tested for total phosphate as outlined in Section 12.Provide any commentary or advice you or another person has for running this protocolPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Document \u0093Chapter 8: TOTAL PHOSPHORUS\u0094Obtain a 50 mL sample of the phosphate solution and place in the Erlenmeyer flask.Incubate at 50? for 10 min and vortex the tube every 2-3 min to dissolve the gel.Check the color of the mixture.Mix the DNA well and store leftover DNA was in PCR tubes in the -20? freezer.Remove the bottom tab from the HisPur Ni-NTA Spin Column by gently twisting.This is the main part of our project and is quite a lot of work so adapt this as you like to fit it in.LB broth recipe for 1 litre is 10g Tryptone, 5g Yeast extract, 10g NaClNo salt LB is as above but No NACl (we are doing this as we can\u0092t find a reason for having salt in LB and are interested to see the growth characteristics)Transform your killswitch into whichever strain is best for your killswitch and overnight a colony in 5 ml of LB broth.Take the OD in triplicate of the overnight and get an average.For smaller volumes of liquid, the smaller-toothed comb wells can hold about 7 ?L.When the agarose cools such that you can hold the flask easily in the palm of your hand, pour the solution into an electrophoresis tray.Add 30?L elution buffer to center of spin column membrane, let stand for 1min, then centrifuge for 1min (room temp, 13000rpm).Pipette 100 ?l of each sample into each well of the clear plate and then 100 ul of sample into each well of the black plate.Note, the gels run only half as far so there is a hit in resolution.Loosely plug the mouth of the flask with a couple of Kimwipes to prevent excessive water loss during microwaving.Microwave the flask in the lab microwave for 70-80 seconds.Transfer mixture to a QIAquick spin column and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000rpm.Smaller pieces of DNA will move faster through the gel than larger pieces.Centrifuge the column for 1 min again to remove residual wash buffer.This protocol was retrieved from a document by the Iowa Rural Water Association entitled \"Filamentious Bacteria Identification & Process Control: A Simple Approach\" [http://www.iowaruralwater.org/tools_tips/toni_glymp/Filaments.pdf].Next, add 750 \u00b5L Buffer PE, centrifuge for 1 minute, and then discard the flow-through.If you are planning on running samples larger than 15 ?L on the gel (about what one large-toothed comb well will hold), you can carefully tape together multiple teeth on the well comb together to create a larger well.The liquid should be discarded and then liquid cell culture should be added to the Eppendorf tube with the remaining pellet.Bubbles can be removed by sucking them up using a pipet.Immediately rinse out the flask that contained the hot agarose with water.Mix by gentle vortexing and incubate for 15 minutes at 25\u00b0C till the colour of the solution changes from blue to purple.CRITICAL STEP: The change in colour implies that polyphosphate is successfully extracted and is present in the aqueous phase.Set the thermocycler to the following settings: 98\u00b0C for 30 seconds, then 25 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, TM- 5\u00b0C for 30s, 72\u00b0C for 30s, and end with 72\u00b0C for 5 min and then 4\u00b0C forever.Add a drop of phenolphthalein to the sample and, if the sample turns red, add drops sulfuric acid until the red color disappears.Transfer the resulting mixture to a new micro-centrifuge tube and add 25 \u00b5L Buffer EB.Next, plate 200\u00b5L of the cells on antibiotic plates for the experimental

inactivate enzymes (return to 4\u00b0C forever at the end).Add 750?L of Buffer PE to column and centrifuge for 30-60s (room temp, 13000rpm).Samples should be laid out according to the figure below.Place Eppendorf tubes into Styrofoam holders and place into the water bath.If you still see undissolved agarose in the flask, microwave it for an additional 20 seconds.Place the bottle in the already running effluent stream and immediately begin timing for 10 seconds.Centrifuge column at 700 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes to remove buffer.If you have just your desired band, you can clean up the rest of your sample with the Qiagen PCR cleanup kit.Once the gel has solidified, gently remove the well comb from the gel.Transfer the gel tray into an electrophoresis chamber.Centrifuge column at 700 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes to remove storage buffer.Remove the bottle from the stream at 10 seconds, DO NOT close the valve at 10 seconds.Be careful not to generate any bubbles in the molten agarose.As a general rule of thumb, the time affects the migration distance \u0096 shorter times equal shorter migration distances and lower resolutions.The agarose should not dissolve in the TAE at this point.This has two key objectives.With standard 1 cm pathlength spectrophotometers, the reading is still instrument dependent (see above).Swirl the plate to move the glass beads around and evenly coat the media with the liquid suspension of cells.Add this amount of water to a PCR tube.Transfer competent cells to ice from the -80? freezer.The side of the gel with the wells should be facing towards the black side (anode) of the chamber.If a red color develops, add sulfuric acid solution until color just disappears.Add 1 mL of sulfuric acid solution and 0.4 g of ammonium persulfate.Adjust as necessary, but beware that pH will drop with the next step.To measure your standard LUDOX Abs600 you must use the same cuvettes, plates and volumes (suggestion: use 100 ?l for plate reader measurement and 1 mL for spectrophotometer measurement) that you will use in your cell based assays.Scatter the cell suspension in drops on the plate.Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge dry column again for 1min (room temp, 13000rpm) to remove residual wash buffer.the basic output of the instrument and not standardised optical density with 1 cm pathlength) into OD600 measurements, whilst simultaneously accounting for instrument differences.Return the cells to the -80? freezer as quickly as possible.Centrifuge at 700 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes and collect fraction in a centrifuge tube.Let the flask cool briefly on the benchtop.To check this after the incubation period pipetted up and down \u0096 if any particulates are visible in the pipette tip continue to incubate overnight.[Note: it is important that the FITC is properly dissolved.Using this and the other given volumes, calculate amount of nuclease free water to be added (for 1?L of DNA solution this is 32?L of nuclease free water).Repeat this step again then measure final DNA concentrations with a Nanodrop machine, using EB Buffer as a blank.However, the migration rate is not linearly related to the fragment size so different gel densities yield different resolutions.Incubate for 4 min.Note: The buffers listed below are recommended.Using the hot plate, boil the solution gently for 30 to 40 minutes, when the total volume is 10 mL.Ensure the water level in the bioreactor is staying at the constant level around the overflow port before opening any outlet streams.If sequences don t match up when you check your sequencing, it may have been because of an error in PCR because even the high fidelity polymerase isn t always 100% Sam Lee and IDT (https://www.idtdna.com/pages/docs/default-source/user-guides-and-protocols/gblocks-amplification.pdf?sfvrsn=12)For a 50?L reaction, calculate the volume of DNA that will be added (recommend using 1?L of 1ng/?L DNA solution).Place spin column in a clean 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.Conversely, the voltage controls the migration speed.Volume determined by NEB calculator and desired ratio.Add 2 ul T4 DNA ligase buffer.Either use pH test strips or the automated pH meter to verify success.The presence of even small amount of organic phase in the next steps may give ambiguous results.Place spin column in a 2mL collection tube.Add more ddH2O, bringing the final volume to 1 L. Seal the bottle with its cap and autoclave tape and put it in the autoclave for a liquid30 cycle (approx.Let the effluent run into the large beaker while adjusting valves.Then, ligate the two constructs and the linearized plasmid together.Monitor protein elution by measuring the absorbance of the fractions at 280nm or by Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Reagent (Product No.Use the Equilibration Buffer to adjust the total volume to be ? 2 resin-bed volumes.After about a minute, move tubes around in ice because the nearby ice has probably melted.We are not allowed in the lab before nine or after five thirty so these are the times we will be doing it but whatever suits you is fine.Repeat the previous step and centrifuge for 2 minutes to remove residual wash buffer.Add distilled water to bring the total volume back to 50 mL.First, add LyseBlue to Buffer P1 at a ratio of 1:1000.Hit the Run button to start running the gel.Alternative: For more throughput or shorter run times, 2 half gels (2 sets of combs per gel) can be run at a setting of 110V, 30 min.However, with the optics on the imager, the effects of this are negligible.Next, add 4 \u00b5L of DNA were to the experimental Eppendorf tubes.To consistently measure flow rate from the bioreactor systemPrepare bioreactor by ensuring tubing is tightly sealed, filter canisters are sitting upright on the table, and the pump is on and refilling the bioreactor.Leave the current setting on the power unit alone.There should be cell growth on the positive control and no cell growth on the negative

dissolve approximately 0.21 grams of agarose powder in 30 mL of 1X TAE in an Erlenmeyer flask or other microwaveable vessel.", "result": "The suitability of the linear regression is also supported by the root mean square error, which, at 0.02, is relatively close to 0.Figure 6: the results indicate that the samples for E. coli containing PPK2 C (both PSB1C3 and PSB1A3), PPX2 (both PSB1C3 and PSB1A3), and PPGK accumulate less polyphosphate than unmodified E. coli, and samples for E. coli containing Pit homolog A and PPGK ATPI accumulate more polyphosphate than the unmodified E. coli.The results, reflective of 72 hours of E. coli suspension in Tris-HCl buffered minimal media, indicate that PPX2 effectively exported phosphorus from the cell compared to the exportation of phosphorus from unmodified E. coli because PPX2 culture demonstrated a higher extracellular phosphorus concentration.Figure 5A standard curve for amount of phosphate per 300 \u00b5l of solution was generated using sodium phosphate glass type 45.No forward primer was used, as we did not have a forward primer that would work for PSB1A3 at the time of sequencing.Figure 3.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformation of PPK2 homolog C in the plasmid PSB1A3 indicate that PPK2 homolog C plasmid has the correct sequence.The sequencing for plasmids in the PSB1C3 backbone were done with the standard BioBrick primers VR and VF2.PPGK ATPI is not working as expected, as PPGK ATPI, like PPGK, transfers a phosphate group from polyphosphate to glucose.In the future, we should extract polyphosphate granules from a large sample of unmodified E. coli in order to obtain a normal distribution curve to which our modified samples could be compared.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformations of PPX2 homolog in the plasmid PSB1A3 indicate that the PPX2 homolog contains the correct sequence.Analysis of Phosphorus Uptake, Accumulation, and ExportationFigure 4: The amount of extracellular total phosphorus in Tris-HCl buffered minimal media after extended 72-hour phosphorus transportation assay with E. coli.Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to quantify the importation and exportation of phosphorus by modified and unmodified E. coli with results detailed in Figure 4.The sequencing for plasmids in the PSB1A3 backbone were done with a reverse primer that targets the his operon terminator on PSB1A3, and so the reaction should proceed, regardless of whether or not an insert was present in the plasmid.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformations of PPX2 homolog in the plasmid PSB1C3 indicate that the PPX2 homolog contains the correct sequence.Figure 3.c.Unmodified E. coli served as a negative control to which PPX2 in PSB1A3 backbone was compared.Figure 1: Transformation of PPX2 homolog on PSB1A3 plasmid into E. coli grown on an LB agar plate with ampicillin.Figure 2: Transformation of PPK2 homolog C on PSB1A3 plasmid into E. coli grown on an LB agar plate with ampicillin.Figure 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate the growth of modified E. coli on LB agar plates containing ampicillin.The coefficient of determination (R2), at 0.975, is relatively close to 1, which indicates that the linear regression is a suitable equation for estimating the relationship between concentration of polyphosphate and absorbance at 630 nm.Meanwhile, these results also suggest that Pit A is working as expected, as Pit A is predicted to transport phosphate into the cell.This antibiotic was shown to be effective in controlling the growth of bacteria that did not take up the modified plasmid with antibiotic resistance, as no growth was found on the negative control.The success of these transformations, as confirmed through plasmid sequencing, is discussed below.Plasmid DNA was then obtained for colonies resulting from transformations and brought to the Purdue Genomics Core Facility for low throughput Sanger sequencing.While PPK2 homolog C\u0092s preference for polyphosphate hydrolysis or synthesis is unknown, the low concentration of polyphosphate in cells containing PPK2 homolog C suggests that PPK2 C favors polyphosphate hydrolysis to phosphorylate nucleoside diphosphates (or nucleoside monophosphates).", "safety": "In its application, the main goals of Purdue iGEM\u0092s phosphate

genetically mating types, + and \u0096 alleles of a mating type complex.The unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is known as a model organism, the first strains were isolated about 60 years ago (1).The algae diverged from land plants over one billion years ago and comes from a linage of Viridiplantae.", "design": "Instead, the sgRNA was designed to guide Cas9 to the 12-kD FK506-binding protein gene in C. reinhardtii, allowing rapamycin resistance as a selection marker for successful gene knockout.This gene encodes the rapamycin binding protein FKBP12.Even though, this knockout strain is not more productive than other strains from an overall perspective due to its reduced growth rate.We believe the ultimate C. reinhardtii strain for biofuel production would have the growth rate of a wild type and the fatty acid accumulation of the sta6 null strain, and our hypothesis is that this could be accomplished with an inducible knockout system.Since the purpose of this DNA construct was to prove the functionality of CRISPR/Cas9 in C. reinhardtii, the sgRNA does not target a metabolic gene.Park S, Lee Y, Lee J-H, Jin E. Expression of the high light-inducible Dunaliella LIP promoter in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.We yet decided to use it, mainly because of the lack of other alternatives and the great effort of optimizing it ourselves, and because only a very low Cas9 expression should be required to enable target gene knockout.By inducing the expression of Cas9 in C. reinhardtii at the biomass peak, before nitrogen starvation, more TAG-bodies would accumulate without affecting the growth rate of the algae.Our construct is designed to demonstrate the functionality of an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in C. reinhardtii.The construct is thought to convey inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of a specific metabolic target gene, directing the cells flux of carbon sources towards triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis.Knockout of metabolic target genes in C. reinhardtii has been successfully performed many times before.For example, knocking out the sta6 gene in C. reinhardtii, encoding the starch synthesis enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, results in accumulation of 20\u00a0% less biomass during nutrient-replete conditions (2).Lastly, we have a hygromycin resistance gene (aph7), serving as selection marker for successful transformation of C. reinhardtii.The construct is constituted by six DNA fragments, assembled by Gibson assembly and designed accordingly.The function of the last fragment is to enable selection of successfully transformed colonies of C. reinhardtii.Inhibition of target of rapamycin signaling by rapamycin in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Theoretically, the YFP reporter gene could also serve as a selection marker, therefore we continued with the primer design.Despite multiple attempts, the assembly has not been fully successful, yet.Baek K, Lee Y, Nam O, Park S, Sim SJ, Jin E. Introducing Dunaliella LIP promoter containing light-inducible motifs improves transgenic expression in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.There are several variants of inducible promoters that could be used in C. reinhardtii to express a gene such as Cas9 at given stimuli, and many of these promoters include addition and removal of chemicals.Metabolic and photosynthetic consequences of blocking starch biosynthesis in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sta6 mutant.The path to triacylglyceride obesity in the sta6 strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.A protein sensitive to rapamycin, naturally occurring in plants, including the algae of interest, C. reinhardtii (7).It includes of a codon optimized hygromycin resistance gene, Aph7, which can be used as a selection marker (8).Despite that the use of a light-inducible knockout promotor in a photosynthetic organism might seem contradictory, it has its advantages due to its manageability.2015 Apr [cited 2016 Sep 4];99(8):3491\u0096503.2013 Dec [cited 2016 Sep 4];238(6):1147\u009656.Goncalves EC, Wilkie AC, Kirst M, Rathinasabapathi B.

and its inhibition induces cell death.But so far, the outcome of these knockouts has not been algal strains producing enough biomass and lipids to be profitable for biodiesel production (1).Due to the potential complexity of using chemicals for this purpose, we decided to use high-intensity light as promotor stimulus.An insert that appeared to be correct was transformed into C. reinhardtii but

colonies with the proper base length were sequenced and it could be determined that Cas9 and LIP had successfully been inserted into the vector, whilst sgRNA, U6 and Hygromycin cassette (Hyg) were not

were successfully obtained.A big part of LiU iGEM\u0092s project is the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.However, the effectivity of this method was quite low and the approach on the assembly needed to be modified.Since no hygromycin resistant could be utilized everything grew on the plates and there was no selection on the plates.The colonies were screened with fluorescent microscope, but because of the difficulties to detect YFP the conclusion was that the electroporation was not successful.", "safety": "To ensure no mutated bacteria or algae got outside the lab, each laborant sterilized their hands aswell as the lab bench they were working with.For chemicals that had a pungent odor (i.e acetic acid), or was poisonous (i.e hygromycin), or for any other type of hazards, we handled these chemicals under a fume hood with nitrile gloves and saftey glasses with outmost care.iGEM has two major guidelines for laboratory work during a project: No genetically modified organisms should be released outside the lab.The first guideline does not apply since all our parts and organisms are classified as riskgroup 1 at the highest.This rule becomes especially crucial if the organism is classified as a GMO.The question therefore follows; should our projcet be considered as GMO?Yes we do have a genetically modified eukaryotic organism, however despite it being genetically modifed, by defintion it is not to be considered as GMO since we have been using CRISPR/Cas9 system to cut a gene without inserting new DNA.Residues of Hutners trace elements, which contained the heavy metals cobalt(II) and copper(II) were disposed of in a waste container for heavy metals.It is of outmost importance that the products that you ship for sequencing or to the registry are transported in a safe and secure manner.The chassis we are using are a non-pathogenic XL-1 blue E.coli strain and all the parts included are unharmful to humans and other organisms.The main project challenge was to ensure that our genetically modified C.reinhardtii would not pose any threat to other wild type algae.The FDA [1], as well as the swedish agriculture department [2] considers the use of CRISPR/Cas9 not to be GMO if you use the system only to cut a gene.At LiU iGEM our main concern has always been safety.Since we were using risk group 1 organisms we were working on a lab bench and always wearing lab coats, saftey glasses and latex/nitrile gloves.This is especially true since our goal is to eventually modify the chloroplast, which, when modfied will severly weaken C.reinhardtii to grow outside in the wild.To assure that no modified C.reinhardtii would escape into the wild this system will be activated by light, so that ordinary sunlight would be sufficient to shut down the organism.Saftey is paramount when working in the laboratory, and this project is no expection.Even if the algae did not belong to any risk group, they were treated as though they are risk group 1 organisms.But, since our parts were sequenced in Germany the shipment to that destination will be discussed here.When our parts were ready to be sequenced we contacted our secondary PI, which had contacts with a sequence company and asked for help with sending it to the company.Careful considerations must be taken when it comes to shipping of biological parts, it would be rather careless and unfriendly for the environment if a gene or a biological part got damaged or leaked out due to improper care during transport.The results usually came after 1 week, which was the standard time, indicating there were no problems with shipment regarding the sequencing matter.1.Since our parts where shipped after the wiki freeze we can not tell about any specifics about how the shipment went for the parts to iGEM:s headquarters.However, we modify a species, C. reinhardtii, which can be applied to the second guideline.", "keywords": "reinhardtii anthocyanin hypotaurine chloroplast examinations Chlamydomonas

"description": "More details can be found on our Project Design and 3) Produce a more temperature stable form of oxytocin using E.coli and/or yeast: The third, and original goal, of our project was to directly address the short half-life and need for refrigeration of the life-saving drug oxytocin.Our next step was to order several shuttle vectors from AddGene so we could produce more of our part using E.coli, mini-prep it out, and transform it into yeast where it would express the proteins required for our oxytocin receptor to form on the cell s surface, and when oxytocin is detected, trigger the FUS-1 mating pathway and produce measureable green fluorescent protein.2) Create an oxytocin quality sensor using a G-protein coupled receptor in yeast: The second goal of our project was to design and test a diagnostic system for medication quality that leveraged G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in yeast.1) Design and build low-cost open source biotools: Denver, allowed our team to build many of the tools we use in the lab including a fluorimeter, an optical density sensor, a DNA concentration meter, an incubator, a refrigerated centrifuge, and a yeast dryer, which we will be exhibiting at the Jamboree expo as part of our \"Hardware\" track deliverables.We are working to improve upon their part by experimenting with different secretion tags to facilitate easier We are still working on this aspect of the project, researching possible mechanisms for producing the human oxytocin protein using yeast, and exploring possible temperature regulation mechanisms to mitigate the instability of this essential medication.In our work on this aspect of the project we experimented with different reporters, yeast promoters and terminators, yeast strains, and selection techniques.Our goal was to use the same GPCR approach to design yeast that could detect active oxytocin in order to determine if the medication sample was expired or not.The goal of the Lethbridge team was also to create a longer-lasting form of oxytocin by adding precursor molecules to slow the hormone s degradation.We therefore wanted to design a system where engineered yeast could be \"dried\" similar to the process for bakers and brewers yeast, shipped in inexpensive packets at room temperature, and reconstituted on site to preform the intended diagnostic funtion.We also used a four-button Olimex LCD screen, which required re-mapping functions to the four different buttons, and adding DNA concentration calculations to the code base.The fluorimeter and optical density sensor we built was based on a design by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team.We used 3A assembly to remove the composite part which included a yeast promoter, a RBS, our OXTR part, a terminator, and the FUS-1 and EGFP parts from TU-Delft.We relied on the DIY receptor design instructions created by oxytocin GPCR.We also requested a part iGEM HQ submitted by the Lethbridge Canada 2013 iGEM team .Different colored filters can be inserted interchangeably into the cuvette holder to filter different frequencies of light, and thus detect opitcal density or fluoresence or DNA concentration.We have begun work on this aspect of the project in several ways.We began by designing our receptor using SnapGene (one of our generous sponsors) and having it synthesized by IDT (for free as part of their sponsorship of iGEM

diameter of the columnUsing a drywall saw to cut the myco foam for the stand supportColumn sitting in dryer stand with myco foam support To operate our fully assembled yeast dryer, you will need a ladder, two blow dryers, a power strip, liquid yeast culture, and an air compressor to provide the pressure for the airgun.The dried yeast falls to the bottom of the column and is collected, while the excess air is vented out.And finally, we would explore different coatings for the inside of the column that could help prevent the yeast from getting stuck to the insides of the column.The 0.7mm nozzle sprayed too much liquid, and contributed to a lot of the yeast sticking to the sides of the column.To avoid this in future iterations, we would explore using higher velocity and hotter air in the heating manifold and the column.Cut two three-inch slits 10 inches apart in the middle of the 20\" cylinder (see image below) 2.Cut a small hole in the bottom of the liquid media bottle and epoxy a piece of tubing with the airgun attachment on the other end into the hole (let dry).Attach the vacuum hose attachment into the 10-inch slit with tape  3.We also insultated the column with

"The concept of our project was to first delete B. subtilis\u0092s BB, and replace its SBP and ABC transporter by the ones of P. larvae.We finally chose bee excrements where P. larvae is still present, which will not be a big concern regarding public opinion and finally which is not invasive.We based our detection system on the iron uptake system of P. larvae and we chose Bacillus subtilis to detect it since they both have a similar iron regulation system.For instance, during low iron concentrations conditions in the extracellular environment, P. larvae and B. subtilis produce iron chelating agents, known as siderophores, and in our case it is the bacillibactin (BB).BB is a catechol-based siderophore-secreted by members of the genus Bacillus (antracis, subtilis).The amount of intracellular iron in B. subtilis will increase with the use of P. larvae\u0092s BB, which will activates FUR and therefore repress LacI.This chain of events will lead to the expression of our pigment, silent in normal conditions, indicating the presence of P. larvae.In a lab settings, the ideal would be to test our modified bacteria simply with P. larvae\u0092s BB instead of working with the pathogen itself.On one hand, the idea being that by putting our modified B. subtilis in the same environment, B. subtilis will be forced to use the P. larvae siderophore which is possible now with the help of the ABC transporter and SBP specific to P. larvae.For the sake of a proof of concept, we modified our system where we will instead remove all other iron uptake system, and its own BB from B. subtilis.If our bacteria changes color, it would indicate that they were able to take up the BB from the unmodified B. subtilis, and also that our pigment expression system is functional.Other factors than pathogens can indicate beehives health.We went from the basic idea of P. larvae detection system with a promotor repressed by a transcription factor in normal condition.Those factors include the bee pathogen Paenibacillus larvae, heavy metals levels, and sugar levels, which will all be detected in bees  excrements.We chose to use bees\u0092 excrements for testing as it is the less invasive solution we found.The other being that the pigment may not be as visible as we would expect in the living organism plus larvae\u0092s cells are closed at some point and even if they do change color we won\u0092t be able to observe it.On the other hand, we want to put a pigment under a LacI promotor (for example), itself being regulated by FUR.With the presence of the component to detect, that transcription factor will no longer block the expression of the pigment, thus the staining of B. subtilis.It is involved in the chelation of ferric iron (Fe3+) from the surrounding environment and is subsequently transferred into the bacterial cytoplasm via the use of ABC transporters and siderophore binding proteins (SBP).In the presence of Fe, FUR, a negative transcription factor, dimerizes upon iron II binding and inhibits its target genes expression.In this case the color change could be observable in the living bees but we encountered two issues.Once in the intracellular environment, first the Fe3+ is converted into Fe2+ then the FUR (Ferric Iron Regulator) takes over.Our idea is to create a system that could be adapted to study any type of factors we are interested in by simply using the same system but each time modifying promotors to make it specific to the factor of interest.", "human_practice": "Our \"Bee subtilis\" put in a free iron media, would only be able activate the production of blue pigment when the defecation contains P. larvae.Finally as we send survey to beekeepers to ask them about our project (here) and after what Mr. Lecompte told us (here).Futhermore, he explained to us that our system wouldn t give any useful informations as one bee, carying our \"Bee subtilis\", wouldn t be representative of the entire hive health.The project evolved into something more beekeepers friendly and closer to reality, as we decided to use our modified bacteria as an external bio sensor.Inside of the bees guts, our \"Bee subtilis\" would be able to grow only in the presence of P. larvae (as the bees  guts are poor in free Fe2+ iron,\"Bee subtilis\" needs the siderophore of P. larvae to grow).We put the target sequence of FUR next to a LacI sequence that we introduced into our \"Bee subtilis\", the lacI would inhibate the expression of a pigment, which mean that in the presence of P. larvae, \"Bee subtilis\" is going to produce a pigment, easily observable by beekeepers, that would color bees.At this point, everything was pretty set.The idea was to insert the receptors specific to the siderophore of P. larvae into our B. subtilis (after deleting its own siderophore receptors).We decided that the best, to help beekeepers have better knowledge of the health statuts of their hives, would be to mesure several factors (as the CCD is multi-factorials).-sugars (Fructose and Sucrose) as the contamination by virus or Nosema ceranae, conduct to sweet defecations by bees.-P. Larvae as one of the main factors of CCD in the US.-Heavy metals as some of the beekeepers were interested by Heavy metal detections, and that some of bees poisoning might be by unknown source or not well studied.However after our first encounter with Mr. Philippe Lecompte, president of the bees biodiversity network, we decided to oriented our project to the detection of pathogens.we try to resume here all the modification we brought to our project after each critical encounter we madeOriginally our project was about to create a system able to detect pesticides in the guts of Apis mellifera, and protect them from any harms, in E. coli.As bacteria aren t able to produce their own iron, they have to get it from their surrounding environnement) of the bacteria with a modified B. subtilis.We choose B. subtilis as it is a Gramm + bacteria very similar to P. larvae.We decided to focus on one of the worst pathogens currently in action in the US, P. larvae.This one would also help researchers collecting data.In conclusion we tried to create, during the IGEM competition, a beekeepers friendly system, that would allow them to follow severals factors involved in bees  health, outisde the hives, easily usable by beekeepers.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Verification of TE we have is needed!Got rid of water and tried to let it dry but without success so will probably just add directly EtOH in to make more CmNote: agar cooled too much before pouring plate (only got 3 plates) so made more 100 mL melted LB agar + 20 uL cmMade SpII-EGTA solution (solutions made yesterday by SofianeAfter thawing competent BSU9716 at 37C in incubator (water bath had issues), added 500 uL of SpII-EGTA and mixed up and down.Added 50 uL bacteria in 5 eppendorf tubes after spinning CT plasmids, added 1 uL of DNA in the appropriate tube (50pg/ul, 20pg/ul, 10pg/ul, 5pg/ul, 0.5pg/ul).Bacteria+DNA mixture incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking (150 rpm) for an hourSpreaded the bacteria on Cm LB agar plate then put at 37\u00b0C overnightAt this point from the rest of competent bacteria, 100 uL spread on Kan platesShould have spread the transformed bacteria on Cm and Kan platesCompetency test kit contains five vials of purified DNA from BBa_J04450 (RFP construct) in plasmid backbone pSB1C3 (cm resistant).? 2 boites de LBamp \u00e0 100 \u00b5g/mL avec du e.coli DH5 alpha + pBS1C  ? 1 boite de LB sans Amp avec que du e.coli DH5 alpha Transformation from 26/08 worked: Red on transformed and nothing red on negative control Made 2 bottles of 1X TAE (100 mL TAE 10X and 900 mL water osmosee) Set up PCR programs for deleted fragments amplification61.6 degrees middle and +2 gradient 3 on left and 3 on right tube 4 in whole 7Dilution Primers: final concentration 5 uM (2.5 uL primer+47.5 uL nuclease free water) Dilution pEN: 1/10 (2 uL pEN + 18 uL Elution Buffer EB) final concentration 3.32 ug/mL1.2% Gel of Gent amplification PCR product (Djamila) 1.2 g Agarose 100 mL TAE 1X 10 uL (10000 X) Gel redGent resistance gene size: 534 bp Band looks like it\u0092s around the expected sizeNote: Have same amount of DNA in all well and this was supposed to be a gradient PCR.50 ml LB and 10 uL Kan added (so total 150 mL and 15 uL Kan) and cells back in incubatorSpin (4000 rpm 10 min) 50 ml X 2 and used pellet for competencySpinned again same way after pulling both pellet togetherChanged medium (50 mL LB + 5 uL Kan) and put it back at 4 degrees2 mL of SpC BSU in SpII and 90 min incubation 37 degrees with shakingOriginally 1.2% of the dihydrate form so made the calculations in function of that; and Sofiane had to make a second batchContains lawn and colonies ?

"description": "", "design": "", "human_practice": "For example, if we suppose a constant production of the same amount of PLA and PET (a fossil plastic), after 5 years, higher amounts of PET would b expected to be found because a percentage of PLA should be degraded in the first two years[5] .Here you can see the article written on the websites of Mariano de Schoenstatt high school, and La Maisonnette high school.We also particularly want to thank the Chilean National Commission of Cooperation with UNESCO, which provided us its support to realize this activity through a letter (download here) Last year, for the first time, was implemented an optional course of Synthetic Biology in the Engineering Faculty, that everyone from the different Departments could take.But if PLA had a short degradation time, we guess people would replace it more frequently by buying more PA products, so higher amounts of PLA could be thrown away and the accumulation rate would increase.This was useful to wonder, for example:  After analysing and debating this problem, our main discussions and conclusions were:A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis would bring us a lot of quantitative information about our project, because it would make us know the specific impacts of the production process in term of equivalent CO2 (carbon dioxide) generation[1] .The team also elaborated an electronic glossary to make sure that the concepts wouldn\u0092t be forgotten after the activity.As it was the first time that such an activity was implemented, the team asked for students  and teachers  feedback, in order to improve the pedagogical material for the next collaboration with an educational institution.If you are interested in knowing more about how the activity was received, here you can read some comments and see a video recorded at the end of the last activity.We want to thank the two high schools we worked with, for the coordination of the activity and the opportunity they gave us to make the pupils discover this new method: Synthetic Biology.According to the previous reflection, we recommend to use PLA for products which will have a short life-time (<2 years), for example plastic cups or bags.He added that if we could demonstrate our fabrication process is cheaper than the current ones, the project would turn very attractive for many digital fabrication laboratories, for he gave us his support at the end of the visit, sending us another letter of inquiry.We reached the Government through the Ministry of the Environment, which manifested its interest through a letter of inquiry, in which it recognizes the importance of \u0093the fabrication of biodegradable materials which implies fewer possible impacts on the environment\".In order to evaluate those impacts, the positive and negatives ones, we met with Claudia Mac Lean, in charge of the Sustainability Office of the Faculty.That\u0092s why we joined an initiative launched by a professor from the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Fern\u00e1n Federici, aiming to gather people from different Chilean Universities and related to Synthetic Biology into a global organization which could be a Foundation or a NGO.We think one advantage of using macroalgae is that it could close the carbon cycle; it means macroalgae would consume environmental CO2 generated in the PLA production process, allowing global reduction of CO2.On the particular case of medical use, we think PLA should be used like suture, because sutures need to be degraded in a short time.Moreover, the degradation would have no nefast consequences on the organism as PLA is a biocompatible material.We infer PLA can be degraded into lactate, which could enter into the metabolic cycle of anaerobic bacteria, generating CH4 (methane) and/or CO2[2] .Students listening to the explanations of the teacher Alvaro Olivera, about Synthetic Biology.Considering the different projects of OpenBio-UChile, it appeared they would have more impact if they came from a wider organization than a Faculty Organized Group.Nevertheless, we discovered LCA in a late phase of the project, so we didn\u0092t have enough time to do this quantitative analysis because we should have looked for all the inputs and outputs of equivalent CO2 of feedstock and energy, for each stage of our process, which is a complex task.If we implemented our project in the long term we would promote cultivation of macroalgae which could contribute to economic development of Chile.We also talked with Andres Brice\u00f1o, co-founder of the Santiago Fab Lab, to make our project cross the frontier of the University and see if there was a real need or interest for biological PLA.This will be the first organization of that type in Chile which could centralize information about Synthetic Biology and constantly diffuse it through a Web platform in an open data way.She made us present our project to her pupils in the context of a Sustainable Project Workshop and she gave us some pieces of advice, like developping a Life Cycle Assessment analysis or asking us the functionality of our plastic; will it be used for every kind of plastic objects?So the idea of mixing PLA with a more \u0093esthetical\u0094 material such as wood allows a friendly design for many objects, which makes composite PLA a good candidate for new 3D-printed products.However we felt we were giving birth to something that could impact the Faculty, so the motivation to design the course is still intact.The teaching staff, iGEM team members and the students who came to learn more about Synthetic Biology together after the activity.Moreover, composite PLA can have better mechanical properties than PLA according to the material it is mixed with, and can last more than 2 years without losing its biodegradable properties, which allows a wider range of use.This would help forming responsible citizens.As this kind of activity was new for the high schools the team worked with, teachers helped with internal diffusion and they also invited other teachers and authorities of the institution.To make sure all these concepts had been understood, the team organized a game in which the pupils had to find the word corresponding to the projected pictures and some sweets were given to the winners!Environments without oxygen could be found in typical landfills, so in a hypothetical situation where PLA would be established in our society (it means PLA would have totally replaced plastic from fossil origin), huge amounts of PLA could worsen the global warming (due to greenhouse gases emissions)[3] .This initiative was born in March, 2015 and we met every month to define what would be the objective of the organization, its activities and the ways we could diffuse them.We think the trade off between replacing fossil plastics and avoiding an overproduction of PLA should need further analysis to evaluate the real impact of the PLA production process.When we presented our project, Andres Brice\u00f1o agreeded that although prices can vary a lot according to the country of origin, it is expensive to buy PLA.The team made an introduction to Synthetic Biology with an activity very similar to the workshop realized in high schools.Also, macroalgae don\u0092t require any farmland, fertilizer or fresh water and is a renewable resource, so it is a better alternative than corn cultivation (which is one of the main current production modes).On the contrary, for long life-time products such as pipes, chairs or big structures, it would be appropriate to keep using fossil plastics.Activation, inhibition and production were symbolized by green, red and white threads, respectively.Example of a representation of a genetic circuit: UV light enhances the production of lactate, which inhibits the repressor \u0093Inh\u0094 of the module responsible for the production of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).In the case of fossil plastic this wouldn\u0092t occur because current plastics are made of fossil combustible, which positively contributes to increase global CO2 amounts if they are partially degraded or combusted .On the other hand, the big problem of fossil plastic is its accumulation[5] .Moreover, the team organized an activity opened to the entire Faculty, in which the teacher could talk about the course and answer the questions pupils made.Moreover, pupils are the future professionals of the country, so it is necessary to broaden young minds introducing Synthetic Biology, how it works and its collaborative vision.Since the idea of our project had born talking with the Fab Lab of the University of Chile, as mentioned in the attritubution section (conception of the idea), we presented our project to the director of the Fab Lab, who wrote us a letter of inquiry.To do that, we used all the social networks we had and the institution diffusion channels, designing a poster and several short posts that showed the connection that synthetic biology has with Engineering.Twelve people came to the activity realized in the Faculty and 5 registered the course.As it was planned to open again the course this year, two members of the iGEM team decided to be part of the teaching staff, to re-design and improve the first version of the course, taking advantage of the experience gained with iGEM and including the open source philosophy.Also, the organization is composed of members from different universities and disciplines, where each one has diverse skills which can complement each other, allowing a faster share of information and technological development through collaboration.Conclusion: in the presence of UV light, GFP can be produced.The goal was to make the pupils collaboratively find solutions to the exposed problems, which difficulty grade increased as the workshop progressed.At the date, the organization is composed of members from three universities, the majority coming from the University of Chile since many students are part of OpenBio-UChile.", "modeling": "Nilsson, a Olofsson, M.

Mol.As another study, we thought modeling a system without cellular communication between \u0093Lactadora\u0094 bacteria and \u0093PLAdora\u0094 bacteria, and to analyze the situation (see Figure 1).Figure 1: A: Our project, two bacteria growing together, the orange producing lactate, green producing PLA; B: Two bacteria growing together, the orange producing lactate without regulation and the green producing PLA; C Two bacteria growing together, the orange producing lactate and the green producing PLA, without communication between them.To simplify the understanding of the process of modeling, we separated this section in 4 principal areas: -\u0093Lactadora\u0094 bacteria\u0094 which includes all assumptions, kinetics and mass balances related to this bacteria -\u0093PLAdora\u0094 bacteria\u0094 that contains all assumptions, kinetics and mass balances related to this second bacteria -\u0093The whole system\u0094 that shows the assumptions and mass balances involving cellular growing, communication between both bacteria, and the final production of PLA.-We assumed that transport of malate and lactate (as organic acids from glycolysis pathway) are behaved similar between each other, considering that both metabolites are responsible for maintaining cell membrane potential.Taking this on consideration, the equations we used in the modeling, for this first bacteria were:Finally, values of constants per reaction that occurs inside \u0093Lactadora\u0094 bacteria are in Table 1.It contains the modules that are shown in Figure 3, and the reactions involved in the genetics circuits inside \u0093PLAdora\u0094 bacteria are:For modeling, we took some assumptions to make the model easier to construct, and to make the difficult labor of looking for the constants kinetics less hard.On one hand, the aim of our modeling was to evaluate how the regulatory network could respond in a two stage cell system, to get a better understanding of how the relaxation times of the reactions will respond to achieve the proper flux for PLA production.On the other hand, we considered an important learning the process to model our system itself, and it would be a reference for other futures UChile-iGEM teams.To construct the model, we searched for all kinetics involved in the genetics circuits, and then constructed the model utilizing CellDesigner and COPASI.[5] K.

performed in triplicate and data were reported as the mean value \u00b1 standard deviation[7].In conclusion, this bioreactor is a sustainable equipment in terms of energy demand for a biological system and nutrient availability.Before writing the equations, it\u0092s important to understand what is happening inside the bioreactor.Recent Advances in the Production, Recovery and Applications of

7, 2007.[7]M.-The rate of transcription was determined using the quotient between RNA polymerase speed per nucleotide, and the number of nucleotides per each gene.", "notebook": "Then, the project of PLA production in a biological system using synthetic biology tools was formed.After the formation of the PLA project was elected by unanimity, we started to work in the design of the project and in the molecular biology needed to achieve a biological system controlled by a regulatory network that accomplished the principles of synthetic biology.Then the first conception was to enable a biological system that could handle a large production of recombinant proteins derived of a synthetic pathway, and that could be achieved using a controlled system based in the kinetic growth of the microorganism.Thus, a quorum sensing based expression system could handle the metabolic burden involved in a new pathway, and the production of PLA could be sustainable in time.One of the meetings of the recently formed iGEM group, in that time called just \u0093OpenBio\u0094, we met the Fab-LAB, a group that were interested in a new form of producing a raw material used for 3D printing, Polylactic Acid (PLA).PLA is actually produced by chemical synthesis using an old system called O\u0092Ring polymerization, so then a biological system should have comparable yields and low cost of purification process.We formed as an iGEM group in 2014, when we started to have recurrent meetings for creating new ideas of possible projects of synthetic biology, including some projects in the Centre of Bioengineering and Biotechnology.The significant costs associated to this process could be improved implementing a PLA export system that could be similar to a PHA phasins export systems reported.Until that we saw different ways of how to produce polymers of different kind in a biological system, comprehending the metabolic pathways known and searching for new genetic sources.In our first meeting we made several brainstorming considering two main objectives: to generate new ideas of projects and assess the feasibility in terms of experimental design.", "protocol": "", "result": "Colony PCR in transformants with gblocks as insert in pSB1A3.b: A plating of the pellet of the previously transformed colonies is done to find out if it is possible to place more colonies

system for stimulation(some signaling molecules called autoinducers) and response(receptor that will transcript certain genes) that is related to the bacterial concentration in the system.So, the mechanism and construction of CACCI can be divided into theChemotaxis Modification: to increase the bacterial mobility, modification based on E. coli chemotaxis related to the parts cheZ will be introduced into bacteria.Permeability Improvement: Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic circuit is very difficult.Chemotaxis consists of two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrates different behavior when the bacteria are exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial or harmful to their metabolism and reproduction.When absence of chemical, there is no molecules bind to the chemoreceptors, cheW, an intracellular protein, is associated with cheA and cheA will autophosphorylate itself and capture phosphate group from ATP.measure the nano distance, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface, the film we used isDuring our experiment , when elastic deformation--caused by the movement of the bacteria antibiotic concentration determination.Deformation caused by CACCI motility can be recognized with optical interference and the interference pattern recognition program inside NDM will analyze the deformation, thus antibiotic situation in sample canAntibiotics, or microbiotics, in narrow sense, are a various type of artificially constructed or naturally existing chemicals containing the capability of killing bacteria or inhibiting their growth, which are implemented widespread around the world.The overexpression of OprF in E. coli will drastically improve the antibiotic absorption capability, like antibiotic condensation occured in E. coli.Viroporins are similar to porins in which they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occurs between hydrophobic, transmembrane and alpha-helical domains of the proteins.SCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria.We hope one day, iGEM could not only share parts, but also share device, a nanomachine with mature functional system.Chemotaxis is a phenomenon of the movement of an organism, specific cells or bacteria, stimulated by chemical molecules.During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.In order to produce slight deformation on the polymer film, we need to find a proper material to make it.Then, bacteria will still swim but not tumble.Because of lack of natural chemoreceptors for antibiotics, we need to construct a genetic circuit specifically to sense antibiotics, and according to the mechanism of chemotaxis, we need to overexpress cheZ to improve its phosphorylation capability on cheY.The resulting interference pattern that application, the two paths may be of different lengths or include optical materialsCooperating with the optical part, the electric circuit part makes use of a CCD camera to take pictures of interference fringe, and then our software in the Raspberry-Pi analysesThis is our design of hardware part.Figure 3 : The design of our hardware, looing from outsideThe Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.The resulting interference pattern that application, the two paths may be of different lengths or include optical materials orBeam splitter combination, consists of three mirrors, a 50% reflection - 50% transmission beam splitter (50%(R)/50%(T) in brief), a 80% reflection - 20% transmission beam splitter(10%(R)/90%(T) in brief).Thus, we transmembrane protein, or more specifically porin, and inhibition of efflux system Previous research from Sahar Melamed and Shimshon Belkin has already selected dozens of promoters responding to antibiotic concentration specifically through the fluorescence able to sense tetracycline(26.5) and oxytetracycline(26.1) at relative high intense.Cas9, which is CRISPR Associated Protein 9 in brief, is an RNA-guding DNA endonuclease enzyme associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from Streptococcus pyogenes and other bacteria.To get more information on our adhesion assay, please refer to Results-Adhesion assayStrategy II: Covalent Adhesion between bacterial membrane and film with proper modification.To achieve covalently adhesion, we decided to implement the parts from 2014 iGEM TU_Eindhoven, and the whole system including these parts:DBCO-PEG4-NHS Ester (Dibenocyclooctyne-Polyethylene glycol-N-Hydroxysuccinimide), which covalently binding to polymer film.pAzF(p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine), a rare amino acid that would be implemented in bacterial transmembrane protein biosynthesis.In order to introduce pAzF into bacterial transmembrane protein, we need to mutate one of transmembrane protein, which is called COMPX.In order to make bacteria bind tightly, we provide two possible and promising solutions to figure it out, one of which is coating bacteria with polylysine(PLL) and the other is to chemically covalent bind between bacteria and polymer film.Polylysine refers to lysine homopolymers, whose precursor amino acid lysine is composed of two amino groups, one at the ?-carbon and one at the ?-carbon.Optical part is actually Michelson Interferometer, which can transform the shape change of a film into the change of interference fringe.In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene.In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene.Implementation of SCVE in ROSE may potentially improve the permatilibty of small molecules including antibiotics.Efflux system is a kind of mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic substances, microbiotics.According to previous researches, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic resistance, or multidrug resistance(MDR).The Young s Modulus of polypropylene is about 1.5Gpa, so it is selected as our candidate polymer film.Bacteria adhering to polymer film is one of the most important parts in CACCI.Implementation of SCVE in ROSE may potentially improve the permatilibty of small mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic According to previous research, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty.Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able in different situations for different molecules.Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.OprF represents one of the largest pore sizes on bacterial outer membranes, allowing diffusion of polysaccharides in a range of 2000 to 3000 Da.\"Breadboard\" is alsoThen let s see the screen , keyboard and mouse.Figure 7: screen , keyboard and mouse movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value.Theoretically, when elastic deformation--caused by the movement of the bacteria containing cheZ parts--occurred on the film, interference will be observed.Consequently, CACCI is also established with systematic permeability reconstruction to increase its capability on molecules absoprtion.Adhesion: According to our modeling, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface.Using Michelson Interferometer, the optical part, Spring transforms the shape change of CACCI s membrane into the change of interference fringe.As for bacteria, naturally, chemoreceptors were expressed on the bacteria membrane, which enables the bacteria to  sense  the existence of chemical molecule concentration in the surroundings.Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of smallOprF represents one of the largest pore sizes on bacterial outer membranes, allowing diffusion of polysaccharides in a range of 2000 to 3000 Da.The plasmid containing tRNA is as following: Figure 16:Schematic covalent interaction, this picture is extracted from guidebook of 2014 iGEM TU_EindhovenTo see more about constitution of our adhesion system, please refer to Notebook-Protocol-Adhesion PreparationOMPx is a integral outer membrane protein X from Escherichia coli, belonging to a family of highly conserved bacterial protein that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells.According to our modeling, see more in Modeling-Film Candidate, pressure caused by adhesive bacteria is about 10^-4 Pa. Consequently, the wavelength of laser about 650nm is able to detect um-scale deformation.Natually, CRISPR/Cas9 system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRISPR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms.In order to completely inhibit the major efflux system of E. coli in genetic level, CRISPR would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.Clutersted reularly interspacaed short palindromic repeats, abbreviated as CRISPR, are some fragements in prokayotic DNA with short repeats.And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9.And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9.Cas9, which is associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from * Streptococcus pyogenes* and other bacteria.CRISPR/Cas system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRISPR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms.Consequently, ROSE is established with both genetically amplified circuit andIn general, ROSE as a community, containing two kinds of bacteria, among which Bacteria I specifically receives antibiotic concentration information from antibiotic substance expression regulator by quorum sensing, whose information is provided with positive amplification for Bacteria II.Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the center of the beta barrel to interact with the aqueous channel.Porins are beta barrel proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able to diffuse.Nowadays, with proper modification, CRIPSR/Cas9 has become a common gene editing tool, being able to cut the target gene with gRNA design.When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depended on the structure of gRNA.CACCI depends on Spring.Actually, SPRING is a measurement system which is designed to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.In order to would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.The signaling signaling molecule will be produced in the cytoplasm using LuxI synthase enzyme and N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone begins diffusing back into cells or other bacteria, threshold concentration, about 10ug/mL.Consequently, we name our main body of device, SPRING, we hope with the assistance of our SPRING, we are able to share and enjoy those clean river, likeThe Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson.There was a time when antibiotics, alongAntibiotic substances containing several mechanism, rendering them to kill and inhibitOrdered formal course of treatment, these antibiotic would effectively treatgonorrhea,However, treating with microbiotics may be associated with a rang of side effects, from some mild including gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea to severe like hearing loss, kidney concentration utilization of antibiotics alter the host microbiota, especially theThe production of antibiotics in pharmaceutical companies explosively expanded these years.Besides, the discovery of NDM-1(New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase)Though, antimicrobial resistance can be transferred through evolutionary theory, main contribution of increasing antibiotic resistance comes from individuals  inappropriate antibiotics treatment, overuse of antibiotics without prescription from professionalDemonstrably, attribution of antibiotic resistance not only from clinically, but from agriculture and animal husbandry.As planned, OMPx will be mutated at residue 16, from glycine to p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine, zooming in the mutated site in orange:Consequently, the model of adhesion goes like this: modified bacteria containing special p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine transformed tRNA carry OMPx with mutated p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine site.In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (AKA plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term \"breadboard\" is commonly used to refer to these.It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance,which is to inhibit the function of efflux system.3.Package: In order to let everyone use the integrated improvement bacteria, CACCI in a more convenient way, we will provide CACCI in powder.Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic circuit.When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depends on the structure of gRNA.The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains physiologically improved of their cell bodies or genetically enhanced capacity of mutagenesis and geneBecause of such horizontal genetic exchange, nowadays, efficacy loss may attribute to the emergence of many antimicrobrial-resistent strains.The head of the drill can be replaced by many part such as saws or polish-head.Oh, all parts should be fixed with hot-melt adhesive (hot glue), in order to maintain stability.In farms or hospitals, solution containing ecological equilibrium of bactierial colonies and sidelong threaten public health.Because individuals neglecting antibiotic emission, rivers in China now encounter substances for human(48%) and animal(52%) in 2013, which is tenfold usage of USA and antibiotic substances in high concentration can be detected from many river basins that evaluation, antibiotics can be detected in all rivers in China in different degree.As figure-1 shows, the system SPRING includes Optical part, Hardware part and Software part.Finally, target gene such as LuxlCDABE will be engineer Bacteria I to release quorum sensing molecules to Bacteria II for exponentiallyTo achieve antibiotic concentration corresponding to AHL production, AHL produced by Bacteria I will be regulated by antibiotic substance sensing promoters.In general, bacteria tumble in the absence of chemical.When presence of chemicals, cheA is free from cheW interaction, and cheZ will efficiently remove phosphate group from cheY.He helps CACCI in three aspects, which are the optical aspect, the hardware aspect and the software aspect.Besides, these proteins as well play an important role in the resistance against attack by human complement system.As a result,It is notable that this second level amplification module won t directly expand the signal intensity, in another way, it will indirectly enlarge the resolution of different antibiotic concentration gradients.In NDM, there is a system for measurement: CACCI which contains chemotaxis modified bacterial adhered to a polymer membrane.The former one is regulated by Lux complex and produces cI inhibition protein and the latter one will be inhibited by cI protein and EGFP will be expressed when lack of cI protein.Consequently, this genetic amplification circuit, compare with others, will not directly enhance the intensity of GFP expression but toThe design intention on bacterial membrane permeability improvement is directly from part of mechanism of antibiotics resistance.For example, in E. coli, AcrAB efflux system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty.It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance, that is to inhibit the function of efflux system.The model is illustrated as following:Our CACCI construction is systematically not only including chemotaxis modification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.Theoretically, bacteria won t receive antibiotic substance because of mutation of its transmembrane protein and efflux system.Besides, using traditional genetically modified circuits to express report is still time-consuming, comparing with generalConsequently, we originally established CACCI based on chemotaxis and interference to make a larger level of antibiotic molecule detection, even a detection for other chemical molecules.Among these rivers, the Pearl River Basin in South China and Hai River Basin in North substances were discovered in these rivers, one of them, for example, in the Pearl River Basin, amoxicillin was found at 3384 ng/L and fluprofen at 2867 ng/L.Although, antibiotics in the river samples, its feature is also deficiency: that is such strong specificity may hurt extensive measurement.Artificial synthesis of sulfonamides, quinolones and oxazolidinones enrich theAs the matter of fact, microbiotics, the great saver of our life, is now putting us inEmergence of antimicrobial resistance is theoretically predictable by evolutionary potential.When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA.When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA.Plus considering cm squared film, we need the Young s Modulus of the film is less than 1GPa.(Attention: the LB liquid medium should contain glycerol which is used for cryopreservation.At last, the software analyses them and transmits the results to PC.However, facing that large scale contamination, complicated routine and trained personnel cannot be satisfied at all districts, so do it in many developing and undevelopedAlong with ROSE, CACCI embedded in SPRING will be used to detect antibiotic.These maximal induction of each promoter strain is tested in the course of 10h ofThe mechanism of these promoters are different from each other.Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments that is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief).Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments which is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief).This phenomenon is based on the interaction between the positively charged polymer and negatively charged cells or proteins.Since the discovery of penicillin by British biologists Alexander Flaming in 1929, the antibiotic family has been enlarged a lot.In China, the overuse of antibiotics for animal is the same serious as the clinical therapy.Spring s hardware, based on Raspberry\u0096Pi, allows spring to take photos or videos of the fringe.Though lack of standard ranking on antibiotic contamination, according to environmental scientistsNow, many technology including ELISA, Delvotest, HPLC-MS/MS, CE and Quantum Dot are able to detect antibiotic concentration in river sample, however much of their have muchNot portable, many big and automatic equipment are indispensable for concentrationComplicated Routine, which requires trained personnel to conduct experiment.The overexpression of OprF they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occursSCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria.CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transferThe Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson.Our theoretical modeling also illustrate a higherOur ROSE construction is systematically not only include quorum sensing and logic amplification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.This is achieved by \"shifting\" the signals between stages within the device one at a time.Later, phosphate will be transferred to cheY and the phosphorylated cheY associates with the flagella motors making flagellum rotates clockwise.During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to 3.MicF: An Antisense RNA Gene Involved in Response of Escherichia coli to GlobalTherefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with an optical interference path, recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.Based on a Raspberry-Pi, hardware part can take photos or videos of interference fringe, then our software analyses them or transmits to your PC.With treatment of IPTG, LuxR will be constitutively expressed to ensure LuxR-AHL complex willIn addition of signal amplification through quorum sensing, an artificial genetically engineered cascade magnification circuit is also implemented in ROSE construction.In this cascade signal circuit, LuxR-AHL complex trigger the activation of promoter Lux, then express cI derived from ? phage.As for E. coli, a gram-negative bacterium, whose surface is formed by lipopolysaccharides(LPP), which is negatively charged at physiological pH.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We hope kids can possess a memory about the mechanism in biological world and the seed sowed by us can prosper in the future.Finally, a panel session was beginning: This session is for students and adults to know iGEM, establishment and history of our team built in 2007 and the future of synthetic biology and biological technology.This is the beginning of our integrated human practice in April.Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and governance of antibiotics in China: This is a main human practice activity closely related to our project.They all hoped these incredible jobs would make more contribution to our human being, environment and the earth.In April 27th to 28th, a theme activity called Saving earth, saving water was established in University of Science and Technology of China.We saw their perfect work in necklaces, and we also enjoyed their smiles during the activity.After people had saw the tiny bacteria and DNA in a large scale, it was time for them to know about a latest track of biology\u0097synthetic biology, and iGEM, the most important platform for youths to know and develop syhbio.With the explanations by the leader of our team, kids began to know the basic principles of synthetic biology.We iGEM team, cooperating with Encoding Life Association (ELA), Natural Conservancy organized promotion and introduction to the public.At the beginning, our host briefly introduced the situation we human-being encountering in China.We hope our human practice would deliver the public fresh ideas on scientific researches as well as build a communication bridge between public need and the frontier of science.The first two things about biology coming up in people\u0092s minds must be bacteria and DNA.I do not know much about synthetic biology, I think it might undermine the law of natural evolution.USTC: Probably, ethics is a very important issue, let\u0092s take the X-Men for it, I think if there is a group of people with specific abilities in the world, maybe the order will be destroyed.As is often the case that the boss is out of sight, people can only notice the tiny part of the pollution while the primary is obscured\u0097because people can never believe that certain antibiotics, sulfamonomethoxine, for example, used on the animals in their plates can be a hundred times more than that on themselves.The data show that only 1% of people know the concrete condition, and the rest 99% of people are only guessing or even totally unaware of the consumption of antibiotics of China.So we can see that people know a little about the dangerous resistance via media, but their concept about this severe problem is still vague.In regard to the techniques to detect antibiotics in water, people seem to be blind, let alone the difficulties we meet in the specific detection of the types and the concentration of the antibiotics.They are not only curious about make their own genome necklace, but felt cool on the mechanism of DNA introduced by our members.Then, our team members briefly introduced iGEM and our projects to the audience.It is pretty good to share our gains and losses with them and enlighten the kids who are interested in science.Then, the leader held a small class for the kids: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for kids to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures.Nearly half of the people hold an optimistic attitude on the antibiotics residue in food and drinking water.When asked about the source of the pollution, more than 80% believe that the major blame of the antibiotics residual should be hospitals, but in fact, the usage on human is only 16%, while on veterinary, 84%.General biotechnology and previous iGEM projects on water cleaning are included in the lecture, as well as our draft ideas about nanomachines detecting trace antibiotics in water.USTC: That is actually molecular biology did not play a significant role in animal protection?sNC?I certainly believe that molecular biology and ecology are closely connected, but generally speaking, science develops focusing on the needs of society, for example, pharmaceuticals.The activity finally attracted hundreds of people joining us, which made such big contribution to evoke public cognition on water and other environmental issues.Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and administrating of antibioticsAntibiotics are widely used on both human and animal in order to defense the illness caused by bacteria.Saving water, a lecture for iGEM: An introduction of the situation of waste and contamination of water around the world nowadays to the public.Leader of USTC, Juntao Yu introduced the basic molecular biology mechanism and iGEM to high school students who were deeply intrigued in biology.The leader firstly introduced the daily laboratory apparatus to the kids and students such as centrifuge, vibrator, PCR Instrument, high pressure steam sterilization pot, incubator and etc.We still believe few can influence many with their constructive suggestions and going into action so that one day people in China, even all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.CineCom, movie community of University of Science and Technology of China, is interested in communication with our iGEM team.We tried our best to eliminate the gap between the fast developing science and puzzled people even if we finally managed to influence few.We hope our work will make a great contribution to letting more people know iGEM, synthetic biology, and believe the fact that we benefits a lot from genetic engineering technology already!It indicates that a number of people neglect the side effect that the abuse of antibiotics may cause.More than 95% of them know that antibiotics can cause antibiotics resistance.Thus, further publicity is needed.According to the last part of the questionnaire, although few of them have heard of synthetic biology, they are positive about biological techniques in detecting antibiotics.We gathered data about people\u0092s awareness of the issues of antibiotics contamination in China.In our human practice section, we combined general biology, molecular engineering and synthetic biology with public health, policies, art, movies, education, environment and society.In fact, the superheroes are human beings with specific features, perhaps one day, synthetic biology can realize the superhero story.So this is not an individual can decide, but will reach a uniform height in the future.sNC?For eco-propaganda, public misunderstanding about it is just like the one about genetic engineering.These are some applications of the techniques, but not science researches.And in 2013, China even consumed half of the antibiotics in the world.This year iGEM, along with ELA, delivered an integrated human practice (IHP) activities for the public.As for the species under the threats of human destruction, humans should not look for ways to protect them just to cover up their bad damage to them.We are surprised to know that children are aware of the word DNA, while they hardly understand the essence of it.CineCom: I think nowadays science fiction superhero plays the main theme of the majority of these movies because such script does not need too deep excavation, but only gorgeous special effects, which can gain substantial box office.Can we preserve the genomes of the extinct species and use them to culture new ones?We explained the mechanism of some of them and we were glad to see some middle school students caring about the working mechanism of centrifuge.In April 14th, we USTC iGEM along with our supervised Encoding Life Association (ELA) held a lecture on water cleaning technology based on common physical and chemical technology as well as some biological engineered technology.So we continued teaching them more about the physic theories in it.For the endangered species, if they cannot adapt to the natural changes, humans cannot help them, either.The abuse of antibiotics is the ringleader because it causes antibiotic resistance.CineCom: From the perspective of evolution, the evolution of our abilities is to meet the real needs.Maybe next time we could try on our epithelial cells!A lecture on general molecular biology, synthetic biology and iGEM was held in August.USTC: Yes, but haven\u0092t the superheroes started to tiring us?People judge things based on subjective preferences of decision, and therefore does not comply with the laws of nature.Nowadays, the unsupervised discharge of antibiotics arouses a big concern about their negative impacts on ecosystem and human health.For example, at paramecium stage, we can only engulf and divide; until the evolution of adult classes, we have the ability to build and engineer.We iGEM team established a club in our university called Encoding Life Association (ELA), especially for science education for children in China.Synthetic biology, a new method, promising it is, we believe it will have wonderful application in solving antibiotics pollution.This year, we continued developing our online account in Facebook and Weibo.Children wrote down their dreams on our broad, some of whom proudly promised that they would join in iGEM, were they admitted to university one day!In order to make our audience better enjoy these galleries, activities, we designed dozens of questions.This activity firstly sent fundamental knowledge and mechanism of DNA extraction for the attenders.sNC: With the reduction of wetlands, and the destruction of the habitats of the migratory birds, the birds are facing unprecedented pressure to survive, not only birds, many other species\u0092 extinction rate is higher than last century.USTC: Certainly.Since recently the public in China is concerned about GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) severely, we want to directly and briefly introduce to them the genetic engineering technology and let them judge whether the GMO is safe for our daily requires with our guidance.Now, we invited their leader Mr. ChungKim Whang.sNC: The main activities of natural conservancy of USTC are bird observing and cradling.Consequently, there is great necessity to make the crowd acknowledge of the proper usage of antibiotics.Isn t it fun and cool?Attempting to attract more contemporary and children on synthetic biology, we built an activity called Come and extract the genome of strawberries with our kitchen materials.Then they started extracting DNA from strawberries according to the protocol we had prepared.sNC?Molecular biological researches on genes provide us with a better reference of classification and explanations of the reasons for extinction from the microscopic point of view.Cross Talk: Now we are expanding our connection from the public to the professionals.Putting it into tiny bottles as the pendants of the necklaces.One of a sci-freak major in organic chemistry in USTC laughed in those following words,That was incredibly amazing!This survey is really important in the promotion of antibiotic pollution and antibiotic resistance.How fast do the birds extinct around the world?However, the improvement in medical conditions extend humans life span and promote humans well-being.So there are lots of collaborations in the progress of filming and screening.For example, the black hole in Interstellar and the theory of clone in Orphan Black?I think this is precisely the potential threat of the \"super heroes\".According to our project, we held a water saving activity and launch a questionnaire survey.But only very few of them care and get to know about whether the pollution of antibiotics approaches to our environment and our daily life.We do not pay enough attention to the treatment of animals suffering from the disease, because generally it seems to follow the laws of nature, sick and old animals should be eaten by predators, so that evolution goes forward.Many people said, taking part in this activity made them better and deeper understand the magnificent work that synthetic biology could achieve.During this lecture, our team member introduced some intriguing methods that provided by previous iGEM teams, including genetically modified phytoremediation of TU-Munich 2013 iGEM team and biological replacement of heavy metal ion contamination in water.A brief introduction of iGEM: A general introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology lecture for high school students.We usually start from the child, giving lectures in primary schools.And we found those children quite imaginative on synbio, neural science and molecular biology.Our simple interpretation on our chemotaxis and interference approach is so fascinating that many adults strongly changed their perspective on genetically engineered bacteria and molecular biology.So, we provided the opportunities for people, especially kids, to get access to megascopic bacteria and DNA, which are usually invisible, just as they are called as microorganism and molecules.", "modeling": "Consider in a current area S, the density of bacteria on surface is ?, and during a interval dt, the change of bacteria density is d?(Sdsigma =K_{a}\times (1-frac{sigma }{sigma _{0}})\times dN-K_{d}\times Ssigma dt)Where Ka is the adhesive rate of each hit, Kd is the drop rate of the adhered bacteria.Then, after solving this Ordinary Differentiate Equation, ODE, we got the equation shown below,(sigma (t)=frac{K_{a}CV_{z}sigma _{0}}{KCV_{z}+K_{a}sigma _{0}}\times (1-e^{-frac{K_{a}CV_{z}+K_{d}sigma _{0}}{sigma _{0}}\times t}))According to this result, the density of bacteria at time t is related to adhesive rate of bacteria Ka, concentration of bacteria c and velocity of bacteria Vz.And we can let (frac{K_{a}CV_{z}}{K_{d}sigma _{0}+K_{a}CV_{z}}) equals an integrative constant, K. In addition, we cannot start recording the image data the moment we put the bacteria on the cover glass in reality, so there should be a time delay in our modeling.Also give some irreplaceable constructive opinions and key indicators on the operation of detecting the concentration of antibiotics.Vz: Average swiming speed component in the z axis, which is perpendicular to S.(m/s)and irrespective of contacting with each other when swimming, we are able to conclude bacterial movement is free.(V_{z}=int_{0}^{frac{pi }{2}}V\times cos\theta \times frac{dS}{S}=int_{0}^{frac{pi }{2}}frac{V}{2}cos\theta sin\theta d\theta =frac{V}{4})Consider during the interval dt, in area dS, there are dN bacteria in tiny volume (dS \times V_{z}dt) hitting the wall whose area is S. Schematic image illustrates the process mentioned above,Because the number of bacteria in solution is much more larger than it on the glass surface whose area is S. So the concentration of bacteria (C) can be regarded as steady during the measurement period.Assuming the number of hitting wall bacteria is stable, the surface can only adhere one layer of bacteria, that is the place which has already adhered bacteria can not stick any more bacteria.Results are delivered below:It is interesting that we could know the \"Initiation moment\" through our data analysis, which is very cool.Another intriguing and important property we got through our data analysis is the adhesion ability(Bacteria to Cover Glass)(AA-B-CS in brief).According to the fitting results and modeling equation, the derivative of the fitting function at the beginning(t0) is the bacteria number growth rate in its maximum.Assuming the rate of stick (P) is constant, the movement percentage of bacteria will present in an exponential form changing through time.According to the fitting results shown above and equations, we could get some useful information when operating NDM, such as,Because we can not start recording the image data the moment we put the bacteria solution on the cover glass, so there is a starting time delay in the equation.After solving these equations above, we ultimately get the Young modulus of material required G <1GPa in order to get ~um order deformation.Therefore, we selected several materials as possible films: low pressure polyethylene, rubbers, and glass as our material of the film.Just think about it, if every bacteria pull together, we can detect the deformation even the film is made of steel and even bigger than steel.This part introduces the data of adhesion experiment, makes exploration and interpretation on bacteria adhesion dynamics.According to the simulation result, when  m  reach 95% of its maximum or minimum value(frac{K}{K+k}), t~100s.Consequently, we recommend user to get the results in NDM, you should wait approximately 100s after putting film into optical path.This part explains the fundamental principle of our detecting method - interference.This explains why we emphasize both bacteria and film material when we defined this parameter.Note: The bacteria solution in  HCB1-PLL(+)-0  sample was not the same with other samples, so the AA-B-CS value is much different with other s.Surprisingly, we found that the concentration of antibiotics doesn t effect the AA-B-CS in our assay, which suggests that we are able to use the same type of bacteria treated with antibiotic in different concentrations, which is another important theoretical base of our NDM.Through the pre-test and data in paper, we use 20ug/ml poly-L-lysine coating the film over 4 hours or overnight at the temperature 4? eventualy.Because the motility of bacteria will decrease when we do not administrate antibiotics.We got the best interaction time is the moment when the number of movement bacteria reach the maximum value.Thus we highly recommend the Bacteria-film intraction time(Ti) is approximately 100s after treating with bacteria solution, which means since you inoculate the bacteria about 100s, you should put the film into your sample solution and determine its antibiotics concentration.In test \"PAO1-PLL-0\", the bacteria solution was culture overnight in 37?(which means the bacteria was in platform stage).One thing need to know is that the different clip we implement in our pre-experiment will get different fringes.In the pre-experiment1 (you can read protocol of our pre-experiment in annex showed below).In the pre-experiment2 (you can read protocol of our pre-experiment in annex showed below).As the deformation range(h) is much more smaller than the radius(r) of the film (h<<r),Because the area of CCD camera is relatively small, whose size is ~cm x cm, the interference pattern is approximately paraxial spherical as well.Ideally, light path sketch should be as follows.Thus we got the accurate equation depicting the density of bacteria time t as,(sigma (t)=Ksigma _{0}\times (1-e^{-frac{K_{a}CV_{z}}{Ksigma _{0}}\times (t-t_{0})}))In order to fit the data conveniently, we change the equation form into a more general one,This program is used to calculate the amount of bacteria and get the percentage of moving bacteria, which is essential for our further research.As the deformation range(h) is much more smaller than the radius(r) of the film(h<where f is the resultant force of the bacteria, F is the tensile force in the film, h is the deformation distance, r is the radius of the film,?r is the variation of the radius, which is r, d is the thickness of the film, G is the Young Modulus.The thickness(d) of film is 0.16mm.Then, we are able to get Young Modulus, a critical physical parameters to depicting the characteristic of film candidates.Assume that 1% of bacteria are push ahead statistically, then the additional pressure given by bacteria is (Delta P=0.01 \times sigma F_{0}).Assume the radius of film is r, deformation range equals h.The film is subject to several forces acting, including force f given by bacteria and tensile force F through the film.Let s get some approximation on this model.Assume the driving force of the movement of single bacteria is (F_{0}) in horizontal plain.Where f1 means the resistant force bacteria containing in water solution, k is a constant called drag coefficient at this conditions.Besides, in the gravitational field, if we consider bacteria dragged by gravity in solution, then the static equation is revised as below, Where rho represents the density of solution, V indicates the extra volume of liquid immersed with bacteria, g means the acceleration of gravity.Then, in accordance with the data in previous research, the speed of bacterial movement(((V_{1}))) is approximately ~10(mu m)/s, while the speed of bacterial sedimentation(((V_{2}))) ~(mu m)/s.And considering the size of single bacterium, assume bacteria as cylinder, whose diameter equals 0.5um and length is 1~3(mu m).This part starts with the bacteria movement ability, analyze the interaction between bacteria and the special film, and obtain the requests of the material properties eventually.The interaction between bacteria and film is essential for our work.(Light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film).However, in reality, because the virtual image of holophote and the film can not be set strict parallel in actual situation, the light path sketch becomes like below, where light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film.We could use the method of coordinate transformation to simplify them as follows, where light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film.where r is the radius of the film, h is the deformation length of the film, a is the length of each side of the CCD camera, ? is the slip angle between the film and the holophote which we estimate.Using these parameters, we simulated the interference fringes image as following,How amazing our model is !More details on our coding using Matlab please refer to 2015 USTC in Github.Calculate a self-adapting or special threshold value in the image binay progress.Now we got the theoretical bacteria density variation formula and an efficient program to demonstrate the real number of bacteria on film.Simulational result just hit the row image we got before!Consider the reflect surface was not strictly parallel with the CCD, and the angle between the surface and x/y axis is ?/?.So we can know the optical path differences and light intensity distribution on CCD areUse matlab to simulate the interference pattern, and the result showed as following, When bacteria pushing the film and making film deform, the angle between film and axis will change.diluted bacteria solution 50 times.If we want to observe the deformation of the film, the bacterial additional pressure on film should reach a stable stage.Solving these equations, we are able to get Young Modulus, a critical physical parameters to depicting the characteristic of film candidates.The film is shown in black edge and the clip that used to fix the film presents in green edge.Through the modeling of bacteria adhesion, we can get some characteristics important but difficult to directly measure on bacteria adhesion and reaction to antibiotics.Calculating with all data, consequently, we concluded that driving force of bacteria is (10^{-13} N) by solving the equations.Firstly, let s check the geometric size of our special film I.So we defined this derivative value as the adhesion ability of the bacteria solution to cover glass, or call it AA-B-CS for short.This equation told us AA-B-CS relates to Ka, the adhesion rate of bacteria on every hit, C, the concentration of bacteria solution, Vz, the average swim speed of the bacteria.Because of the same interaction between solution and bacteria, in gravitational field, bacteria share the same k with the horizontal movement constant.Assume the motor ability of each bacteria does not change.The thickness(d) of film is 0.1mm.Assume the numerical density(?) of bacteria is ~(1000 /mm^{2}), which means a single bacteria occupying the area of approximately ~100 (sim 100 mu m^2).The wavelength of laser we used is 650nm.The film I is a circle with the radius(r) of 2cm.Give a method to process the interference image and calculate the deformation of the film in a high precision.Our experiment is initiated from interference fringes pattern formed naturally.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "The more fluorescence intensity we got, the more permeable theHere s our results, the first

relatively low optical density as its OD600 after 9 h is 2.3 compared to the wildtype.Besides, owing to the existence of ?-galactosidase in bacteria, a more intense optical density we detected, that means there are more ONPG uptaked by bacteria.Consequently, using this feature, we are able to characterize bacteria permeability by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the bacteria solution.Based on these, we know that the concentrationsFrom this figure, we can see a rising trend in all bacterial solutions.We can infer that the absorbtion of modified bacteria is higher than the wildThere is a

check whether we meet relevant local and national safety standards and offer biosafety training to every member in the wet-lab.Meanwhile, to keep us safe from hazardous chemicals and organisms, personal protective equipment, such as gloves, respirators and lab coats, were required during the experiment.Before the experiments started, we fully prepared for the biosafety in lab.When conducting experiments and assemble NDM, level A should be satisfied always.Class B: In level B, personnel should not only wear lab coat, but wear nitrile gloves or latex gloves, which are necessary when touching bacteria solution.Even all the parts have been proved no harm to the public usage, we still take genetic safety into consideration.Microorganism auxiliary to the device (CACCI) is genetically engineered E.coli, carrying micF, SoxS, Cas9, CheZ and OprF.This procedure is the first step for detection.Class C: Level C is the standard protocol for personnels when drilling.Even leaked to the environment, they are not competitive enough to survive and threaten the environment and public health.This protection guide is especially for people who are interested in making NDM their own or who will use NDM for material detection.Microorganism will be conglutinated to the film and then encapsulated.And please do remember ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES to prevent possible hurts and DO NOT WEAR GLOVES because it is not convenient when drilling.Class D: This is the most complicated protective measure for spraing painting procedure.This year, none of the new parts will raise safety issues for further applications in the current knowledge.During all the experimental period, the regulations were obeyed.P. aeruginosa is classified to BL2 so special attentions were paid to the relevant experiments.Please pay attention to personal safety when doing experiment:Class A: Fundamental protective measure when producing NDM and conducting experiment.One should wear lab coats, along with goggles, masks and gloves to toally protect oneself considering extreme pungent odor volatilizing when painting.To prevent possible hurt, those safety methods are defined by ourselves.When you are

of cell number thrown off by changes in cell shape, bad statistics (not measureing enough cells).First we find that the T7 promoter we used has no leakage and no detectable GFP is synthesised.Comparing the different fluorescence levels qualitatively the results are essentially consistent with those obtained using RFP though the quality (accuracy and precision) of the measurements is better for the TECAN microplate reader and the fluorimeter.To quantitatively compare the measurements with GFP expression and those previously obtained with RFP we have plotted one against the other for our 2 best protocols.The results from this protocol are shown below and show that there is a less good correlation than with the RFP measurements and those from the microplate reader and the fluorimeter.The instrument and its use are described in the methods and protocols section.The standard curve with the Dye shows there is a reasonable linear relationship between the measured fluorescence and the dye concentration (R\u00b2=0.96) though this is much less good than we obtained with the fluorimeter or the microplate reader suggesting the measurements are less accurate and reproducible.This curve shows, that under our measurement conditions the fluorimeter is about 100 times more sensitive than the microplate reader, as measured by the slope ; and 5 times more sensitive if we consider the concentration necessary to obtain twice the background measurement (0.5 vs 2.2 ng/ml).Below we show the results obtained for the different promoters measuring fluorescence from diluted cell suspensions.The instrument is also less sensitive than the other machines with a measurement of twice the background at 12.4 ng/ml.The measurements of cell suspensions shown here are less obviously consistent with the RFP measurements than obtained the machines used above.In view of the lower dispersion of the standard curve, and the greater sensitivity of the instrument we expect these results to be slightly better than those obtained using the microplate reader.The microplate reader and fluorimeter are commercial instruments designed to measure fluorescence in solution.These results are completely in agreement with those obtained using the microplate reader, and from the measurements of RFP.While the graph shows an approximately linear relationship it is imperfect, first the scatter suggests a small effect of the coding gene on the strength of the promoter, second the levelling of in the TECAN microplate measurements suggests an instrumentation problem (saturation of some sort) associated with our experimental conditions.We obtained fluorescence measurements with 4 different machines.We could then measure the strength of the promoter we used under standard conditions in a well characterized assay.Each promoter was integrated into a construction expressing GFP Bba_I13504 with a strong/weak RBS (BBa_B0034).We choose to use 4 different methods to study the strength of the different promoters:Each machine (if possible) was calibrated using a standard solution of the dye Atto488.However the results obtained with this simple and cheap device could probably be improved with a little more optimization.A microscope allows us to observe individual cells, this can give further information on the bacteria containing the different expression systems.Our T7 shows very low basal expression barely different from the negative control (477+/-4 vs 224+/-316 for the control) this means that in the absence of induction in the correct strain there is probably no leakage and the promoter does not work at all.The fluorimeter we used is much more sensitive than the microplate reader.We observe a small but significant difference in the slope of the standard curve depending on the buffer showing a slight reduction of fluorescence in LB buffer.The results obtained for the different promoters are shown here.First, as observed with the standard curve, a certain dispersion in the measurements probably arising from an imperfectly optimized protocol.As in the microplate reader, and can be seen in the figure, the standard curve with Atto488 is linear, with very little dispersion of the points.The microplate reader and fluorimeter appear to give the best and easiest to interpret results with the possibility of using a calibration curve to obtain absolute concentrations of GFP.This would need a standard GFP solution for the calibration measurements rather than Atto488.The Magicbox measurements were less accurate and precise.For the cell measurements samples were also 10 times more dilute.This allow us to compare the measurements on the different instruments.The Team AMU decided to study 5 different promoters from the collection in table 1 (J23117, J23106, J23118, J23101 and J23100) and compare also the T7 promoter Bba_K525998 that we used for some of our constructions (J23117, J23106, J23118, J23101 and J23100).In agreement with the previous measurements for RFP the J23100 promoter is the strongest and the J23117 the weakest of those in the promoter collection.Is the physiology of the bacteria seriously modified resulting in bacteria with a strange appearance.In the figure here we show some bacteria expressing GFP from the construction with the strong (1791AU in the table) J23101 promoter.So the samples used, both for the standard curve went only to 0.0175 ug/ml as opposed to 0.7 ug/ml for the microplate reader.", "safety": "", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track":

cadmium is globally existed?Smelting, spraying, welding and casting bearing surface of cadmium?Stope?Rods in nuclear reactors?Neutron absorber?Electroplating factory, and so on.In June 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission confirmed that the glasses sold by McDonald were found to contain cadmium elements in the paintcoat, which could exude from the surface of the glasses.When our E.coli is in a certain condition of low cadmium ion concentration, only the green chromoprotein cjBlue will be expressed, leading to a color of dark green in culture.We employ E.coli superficial fiber curli protein\u0097CsgA and synthetic phytochelatins (ECs) to form CsgA-ECs, which can effectively remove cadmium ion in wastewater.Up to now, in 2014, a village in Guangxi, China also has the occurrence of Itai-Itai disease.Figure 2: A child was moaning because the great pain caused by Itai-Itai disease.Cadmium\u0092s entering human body can make it a huge loss of calcium in bones and trigger a series of damage, like osteoporosis, bone atrophy, joint pain and so on.", "description": "", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "Another great pity is that crippled by our poor measuring apparatus, we merely did some preliminary data measurement and treatment.Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the color change and the capacity of cadmium adsorption of the whole system in different initial concentration of extracellular cadmium ion.Based on the strength of these two promotors, we built a mathematical model to predict the capacity of processing the cadmium ion.The core of Bio-effector is csgA-EC compound.We also built a model about that based on their chelating equilibrium constant and use it to do the same thing as last model we have talked about.However, not everything went well, because of the lack of time, we failed to knock out the gene of csgA of wild type on time, we could only gain our referential parameters from multitudinous literatures and establish a similar model.This kind of method leads a result that when the concentration of cadmium ion is below the low limit of detection, the system is blue, otherwise it\u0092s red instead.We believe, by doing so, we may conform better to the meaning of synthetic biology.As was discussed before, there are two devices of our system, one was named bio-sensor and the other, of course, was named bio-effector.And here we will just briefly talk about them.The former also has two main parts: PcadA, which is the cadmium ion induced promotor; and Ptet, which is simply Tetracycline induced promoter.The whole system was the divided into two devices.In order to simulate how it worked and made it simple for us to evaluate the result, we strive vigorously to establish a precise mathematical model of the procedure.CsgA-EC, whose function is decreasing the concentration of cadmium ion by using chelation, is the unit of our E.coli\u0092s curli.", "notebook": "Having finished this part ,we had time to give assistance to our partner , cooperation makes our team more united ,and we gained a lot of joy at the same time.Without the Cd2+ existence , Ptet didn\u0092t resist the expression of cjblue ,and we can see blue fluorescence in bacterial colony.In this way we can distinguish the expression difference of E.coli under the condition of Cd2+ existence or not.Contents: Obtained Ptet and cjblue through PCR techniques,we digested Ptet and cjblue,they were assembled in plasmid pSB1c3.Notes: We found some problems at the beginning,we can\u0092t get the Ptet due to the false we made in primer designing,we re-designed the primer and got the right gene successfully.Besides, during the recovery of PCR product,No plastic recycling caused empty PSB1C3,later then we change the way of recycling,this trouble was dealt smoothly.Conclusion: Moloecular construction of this part was relatively simple as last part.Although we met some problems ,we corrected them in time to make our plan developed,which was worth for us to feel happy,and it made us believe in ourselves that we could finish the project perfectly at the same time.Introduction: We built the pathway for Cd2+ ion to enter into the E.coli ,we had constructed parts as follow: Contents: PCR techniques, transformation of plasmid,constructed PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 on PSB1C3.2.Assembled PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 to the pSB1C3 with pSB1C3 on it.Note:we had some trouble on the way to get PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 through PCR techniques, we can not obtain target gene from plasmid by PCR directly because these promoter were too short, so we adopted overlap PCR to get them.Later then,we successfully constructed :Conclusion: we managed this part of moloecular construction smoothly without too much problems,which made our experiment in an orderly manner.With the PcadA designed on the primer,we successfully constructed PcadA on CsgA-EC?0?1?2?3?5? The PcadA-CsgA-EC(0?1?2?3?5?were digested by restriction enzyme ,then they were loaded on the pSB1c3 which contain the gene of tetR-RFP-ter.During this part we met many kinds of problems so that we had spent many time but we can not improve the efficiency,which meant we had to reflect ourselves.During the month,we were trying to find out the reason why CsgA can\u0092t fit PcadA successfully.We checked the correctness of gene,even we restarted from the first step,we gained nothing.As shown in figure, the protein MerR can repress PcadA with Cd2+ absence, which makes downstream gene TetRcan\u0092t express so that it can\u0092t repress Ptet.We started to do the PCR in order to get our targeted gene PcadA and CsgA-EC?we got the CsgA?EC0?from company?so EC would be link with CsgA during the PCR procession?EC?2?3?5?had to adopt two-round PCR due to their length.We got the Top10 strain to prepared for our experiment and we used restriction enzyme to digest single gene (tetR?RFP)on pSB1c3,and made a ligation with terminator.This year our project aims to dealing with heavy metal ion--Cd2+,considering about the amount of work, we divided our project into two parts: intracellular Cd2+concentration sensing signal circuit structure and extracellular surface adsorption.We obtained PcadA and CsgA ,we tried to link them,however,we found no colony on culture medium.At the same time, cjblue stop expressing with tetR\u0092s expression so thatE.coli becomes red gradually.Up to now,all moloecular construction had been finished.We successfully constructed  Having finished moloecular construction we sped up composing our wiki,On the other hand we started to prepare posters and the presentation at the same time and detected parameters by modeling group to perfect our project.We repeated the transformation but found that the colony we transformed last week turned blue,which meant false positive colony grows faster than target colony.After we finished transformation and inoculated ,we sent our plasmids for sequencing,however ,nothing was found on pSB1c3.", "protocol": "Until the front of the dye into the separating gel, boost the voltage to 150V,

environment?Because the Cd2+ solution can only be absorbed rather than be broken down, if the genetic microorganism which have absorbed Cd2+ are not recycled,it will release Cd2+ to natural environment sooner or later.First of all, we tend to add a adhesion molecule mechanism which is controlled by PCadA to make it easier to get down in the bottom of the water as the microorganism begin to absorb Cd2+.So the Secondly, we add auxotrophic genes in the relevant auxotrophic bacteria which are controlled by PCadA so that the genetic microorganisms can live in our polluted water rather

PCR amplification of another leading to a new, chimeric 16S gene that is not indicative of any bacterial or archaeal species.These reads must be removed to make sure that our data are accurate.Third: we aim to construct a metagenomic library of the microbial DNA found in the porcupine microbiome as a way to isolate and characterize genes for useful cellulose degrading enzymes that can be expressed in E. coli.DNA provides better taxonomic identification than traditional bacteriological assays like Gram stains.It is conserved only in prokaryotes, thus excluding eukaryotes from our identification proceduresIt is a short sequence, which makes it ideal for cheap Sanger DNA equencing and for high-throughput technologies like those used in the Microbiome Survey sectionThe 16S rRNA gene contains nine variable regions, some of which are flanked with constant regions that can be used to amplify smaller fragments that contain the variable regions.This part of our project is designed to determine if a metagenomic library constructed from the DNA extracted from gut microbiomes is indeed useful for biological engineering: in our investigation, we are specifically seeking genes that encode enzymes capable of degrading softwood lumber waste and turning it into useful compounds like bio-plastics and bio-fuels.PICRUSt can then output a predicted metagenome for each 16S sequence picked in the closed OTU picking step and provide inferred gene content for the entire microbiome.The fecal samples contained ton s of bacteria, and we wanted a quick and easy way to ensure there were some cellulose degrading bacteria.We are left with clean, pure genomic DNA from all the cells in the fecal sample.To prepare our genomic DNA sample for illumina sequencing, we first had to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to create many copies of a specific region of the genomes.The taxonomic assignment occurs in 7 steps, which are all wrapped by the pick_denovo_otus script provided by QIIME:Pick OTUs based on sequence similarity within the reads (de-novo picking)Each step here gets us to the OTU table, which can be used for downstream analysis including chart creation and PICRUSt analysis.Lastly we remove low confidence OTUs that are represented by less than 0.1% of the sequencing reads.We must use the QIIME tools to clean up the raw data and retain what is useful.The first step is to align forward and reverse DNA sequence reads, which come out of the sequencer as single-strand reads, and compile them into double-stranded reads.We invite you to check out our entire process and walk with us as we explore the vast possibilities of cellulose degraders, microbiomes and biofuel production.The function of this microbiome survey is to get a handle on what kinds of organisms are present in mammal microbiomes to see if the use of microbiomes as a \"mine\" for biological engineering purposes is feasible.For 16S sequencing using high-throughput assays, it generally requires a smaller piece of DNA, so these constant regions can be useful when the input size is smaller than the entire gene.When we first begun our project we had every intention of constructing a metagenomic library using the porcupine fecal sample as our environmental isolate.This gene is used widely as a molecular phylogeny taxonomic identifier: analysis of the obtained data will provide us with a good idea of what bacteria are present in each sample.The microbiome helper tool, developed by Dr. Morgan Langille, contains the entire Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, pronounced \u0093chime\u0094) set of tools which, collectively, are an open-source pipeline that wraps many other tools necessary for the analysis of illumina sequenced 16S rRNA gene data.The incorporation of the vector into a model organism provides that organism with selectable growth advantage, which can help to identify organisms containing the vector.Introduction of vector (and foreign environmental DNA) into a model organism.The DNA extraction step allows us to identify these bacteria through the bacterial DNA found in each fecal sample.Through the use of 16S taxonomy data and through PICRUSt analysis we intend to show that these microbiomes are a gold mine for biological engineering.The wildlife park has been an invaluable resource.Using PCR we amplified all of the 16S regions found in our fecal sample DNA extractions When the PCR-amplified DNA is placed into the flow cell, the adapter region added by PCR binds to complementary oligonucleotides attached to the surface of the flow cell.The resulting sequences were used to identify the bacterial colonies to the Genus level.The 16S rRNA gene, as mentioned in the Microbiome Survey section and here in Isolation, is a perfect gene for taxonomy identification in bacteria.This number is chosen because it is the predicted sample bleed-through on the illumina MiSeq machine, making it a cutoff for removal of low confidence OTUs.Using QIIME we can then create alpha- and beta-diversity charts for the samples, and pie/bar charts for taxonomy for each phylogenetic group (class, family, genus, etc).A chimeric read is a piece of DNA amplified during the PCR step that is a combination of two separate molecules that became joined as a byproduct of PCR.For illumina sequencing, the oligonucleotide primers also contain an adapter region that is added onto the terminus of the amplified 16S rRNA gene DNA, allowing the DNA to be compatible with DNA linked to the illumina sequencer flowcell.To be used in further downstream processes, the large environmental DNA pieces were cut by restriction enzymes which act at specific sites called restriction sitesIncorporation into a vector.This pipeline makes it possible to analyze 16S data efficiently and with accuracy to determine the taxonomy of the microbial community represented by the 16S sequences.contain not only sequences that are important to us, but also chimeric sequences, bad quality sequences, very short sequences and lots of other \u0093junk data\u0094 that could interfere with our taxonomic assessment down the pipeline.For this task we use QIIME analysis tools with the help of the Integrated Microbiome Resource here at Dalhousie University and Dr. Morgan Langille\u0092s Microbiome Helper tool.To fully understand the data that the illumina sequencer gives us, we must use a data analysis pipeline.This was done as a quick and dirty identification of some of the cellulose degrading bacteria as a starting place for our project.These oligonucleotides anneal to a template and provide a free 5\u0092-OH group, essentially priming the DNA synthesis reaction; the heat-stable polymerase then amplifies DNA from that template strand.The chemical analysis part of our project allowed us to ensure that using E. coli in the softwood lumber industry would be feasible.A pipeline is simply a set of tools used in the workflow of data analysis to provide us with a clear picture of the data we have collected.This is what we are aiming to do with this year s project.Our project will characterize the microbiomes from the North American Porcupines found in Nova Scotia forests and attempt to \"mine\" the microbiome for useful enzymes.The adapter addition is important because it introduces specificity in that only DNA containing the adapter will be sequenced.The environmental DNA extraction provides us with DNA from the organisms in the microbiomes of each of the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park mammals.Thus, the gut microbiome of the North American porcupine seems like a logical starting point for our search of a microbiome to mine.Our project is designed in three stages.Analysis of the genomic DNA mixture provides us with biological information such as the identities of the organisms present and the major functions of the microbiomes.In the case of PICRUSt, the OTU picking is done against the GreenGene database, and that database is then used to predict gene familes from the metagenomes associated with that database.The PICRUSt algorithm works in two steps.The sequence information can then be used to determine what bacteria are found in the sample.Illumina sequencing provides a massive amount of data that must then be sifted through with the aid of computer programs.Examples of these can be seen below, and these charts from our fecal sample analysis can be found here After taxonomic assignment, a tool called Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was used to determine functionality of OTU\u0092s within the microbiome of each animal.Because this is a particularly daunting task for even a strong computer, this step is only done once and the output is provided for the next step.This metagenome inference is done by comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequence to known sequences and makes conclusions on the identity of each sequence\u0092s evolutionary relative.The terpenes often found in pine tree resin are known to exhibit anti-microbial properties -- this could be an issue if we try to utilize bacteria to break down softwood lumber, for example.The terpenes in pine tree resin have high boiling points (150C - 200C), and simply distilling them would cause decomposition of the terpenes into other compounds.After many cycles, we have exponential amplification of the segment of DNA that is flanked by the oligonucleotide primers.After collecting the distillate from this procedure (which is actually a mixture of clear water with a thin film of terpenic extract floating on top), the organic layer is extracted out and used for analysis!Abubucker, S., Segata, N., Goll J., Schubert, A. M., Izard, J., Cantarel, B. L., et al.Alkaline lysis works through a detergent, which disrupts the membranes of the bacterial cells.A discrete portion of the 16S rRNA gene from each of the three microbes was amplified using pcr.Although we didn\u0092t get too far with the library, we did make some changes to the protocol to make the construction procedure more efficient.We were originally interested in developing the metagenomic library as it would provide the ability to assess and exploit the whole microbial genomic composition found in our environmental sample.If half of the sequence matches a region from one genome, while the second half of the sequence matches a region from the genome of a different organism, the program knows that the sequence is chimeric and not a biologically distinct sequence.Next, the non-chimeric, paired and filtered reads are matched against a database.QIIME uses PEAR (Paired-End reAd mergeR) to do this.The next step is to use a statistics tool called fastQC, which provides us with information of the read quality and length from the paired reads created in the PEAR step.*; Caporaso, J. G.; McDonald, D.; Knights, D.; a Reyes, J.; Clemente, J. C.; Burkepile, D. E.; Vega Thurber, R. L.; Knight, R.; Beiko, R. G.; and Huttenhower, C. Predictive functional profiling of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences.PICRUSt infers the gene content of the organisms present in the OTU picking output by comparing them to their sequenced evolutionary relatives.Each colony that grows can be used to study a specific fragment of DNA from the environmental sample.Examination of the DNA in the metagenomic library.The DNA inserted into the model organism will contain genes which will code for enzymes.These fecal samples contain millions of each animal\u0092s gut microbes, which make up the microbiomes of their gut.First: we hope to isolate and characterize the microbiomes of many animals found at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park.We used chloroform extraction to isolate large pieces of DNA from the porcupine fecal sample.Manipulation of the DNA.Because the 16S region of the bacterial and archaeal genomes are conserved, they often contain some level of sequence similarity.Terpenes are insoluble in water, and a mixture of the two (with far more water than terpenes) will boil at a temperature slightly lower than 100C.Through de-novo OTU picking, the program does not throw out 16S data.This is problematic because we d be left with the following question: are we testing the inhibition of pine tree resin terpenes, or the products of terpene decomposition?Although we DID use conventional distillation and obtained a terpenic extract, we also applied a \"softer\" distillation method to avoid potential decomposition.The specific region we require for microbial identification is the 16S rRNA gene.A microbiome is the collection of microbes found in and on larger organisms.Because they eat a supplemented diet, and diet does affect microbiome content, there is potential error associated with the use of samples obtained from the Park.We did not get to the metagenomic library this year, but a quick description of it is given here.Cellulose-degrading bacteria were isolated on cellulose medium (see protocol page for medium recipe) which contained ground Whatman paper acting as the cellulose source.That being said, we did begin the construction of the library with the help from the Waterloo iGEM team who provided the pJC8 cosmid, to be used as the vector for our library construction.Metagenomics can provide insight into enzymatic pathways, evolutionary profiles, and microbial function.Metagenomics provides the chance to search through the incredible biodiversity found in the environment without having to conform the sample to fit within standard laboratory techniques.The Park was also the safest way for us to obtain fecal samples, so associated error was acknowledged as part of this process.We obtained fecal samples from 21 mammals at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park.Shubenacadie Wildlife Park Microbiome Survey | Metagenomic Library and Isolation | Chemical AnalysisCellulolytic enzymes have become a very interesting field of research for the potential production of microbial biofuels.This step is extended to organisms that are part of the living relatives group, but are still unknown because they have not been studied.The bound PCR products are sequenced through the addition of fluorescently labelled deoxy-ribonucleotides that glow when they are incorporated into the DNA molecule.It is more inclusive because any 16S sequence not matched to a reference database in open and closed OTU picking are thrown out.Our chemical analysis section allowed us to look into this and ensure we won t have any more problems down the road.Bacteria have already established their role in industry, and their applicability in the industrial sector has been growing rapidly.After receiving fecal samples from Shubenacadie Wildlife Park, the team plated the samples on the cellulose medium.The annealing step allows the oligonucleotide primers to bind to the single-stranded molecules at their complementary sequence.The database matching step picks operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are represented by distinct 16S gene sequences, and compares them to a database to be taxonomically identified.Otherwise, matches will not correspond to the precomputed reference database and PICRUSt will be unable to complete the second step.The second step is metagenome inference.This allows for the insertion of DNA into the cell followed by its maintenance and the stable production of plasmid-encoded proteins.These colonies were then streak purified on LB medium.We managed to isolate bacteria capable of growing on the cellulose medium.The transformed cells are then grown on selective medium and only cells that contain the vector will survive and form colonies (because of the antibiotic resistance segment in the vector).However, we considered this error to be minimized as the mammals eat many of the same things they would in nature.For the initial round of porcupine fecal samples, we made duplicates of every plate so that we could incubate in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.This happens hundreds of thousands of times in a massively parallel process to sequence all of the amplified DNA from our PCR amplification step.De-novo OTU picking matches 16S sequences together into OTUs without the use of any reference database; Open OTU picking matches 16S sequences to an open-sourced database like BLAST; and Closed OTU picking matches 16S sequences to a closed database like GreenGenes.fastQC also has scripts for this process.Following filtering of the reads, chimeric reads must be removed.Producing biofuel from things like leftover vegetables, lumber industry by-products and waste, seaweed and other easily obtainable sources could provide an answer to the ever-growing problem of energy production.The Softwood Lumber industry is particularly pertinent for Nova Scotia.The softwood lumber industry in Nova Scotia also harvested roughly 29,000 hectares of forest for the creation of softwood products.The vector is often introduced into the model organism, Escherichia coli, through a process called transformation.It is important that the sample collected represents the entirety of the environment being examined.It can then use the host cell macromolecular synthesis machinery to produce proteins encoded by the foreign genetic material.Interestingly, the North American Porcupine eats mostly bark and wood from trees found in Nova Scotia.This is why OTU picking from QIIME taxonomy assignments must be done to a closed reference database.Metagenomics, in comparison to phytogenic surveys, does more than look at the diversity of one gene (ex.Arctic Ocean Microbial Community Structure before and after the 2007 Record Sea Ice Minimum.HUMAnN: The HMP unified metabolic analysis network.Imagine taking these useless by-products and turning them into a sustainable form of energy like an ethanol biofuel through a simple biological reactor using E. coli and enzymes harvested from cellulose-degrading bacteria.The research in this area is new, but we are learning more and more of the importance of a healthy gut microbiome.The animals are fed a supplemented diet, which consists mainly of natural diets with added food like fruits/veggies for the herbivores and protein supplements for the carnivores.Mechanical lysis works through small ceramic beads shaken in the tube at high speeds to mechanically break up bacterial membranes and release the bacterial cell contents.The metagenomic library is our future goal for this project, which will enable us to screen for useful enzymes in biofuel production from our fecal sample bacteria.PCR works by using small oligonucleotides that are called primers, and a heat-stable DNA polymerase.The method we used is de-novo OTU picking, which does not use a reference database for OTU picking, and then compares the OTU\u0092s to a database for identification.However, as other areas of the research began to erupt in exciting results, the library got put on the back burner.The broken bacterial cell debris is discarded and a supernate is passed through a column, where DNA binds but all other cell material flows through.To get access to this sequence information we used Illumina MiSeq.The illumina sequencer works on a principle called sequence-by-synthesis.A vector is a DNA molecule that can carry foreign genetic material into another cell.Our work is definitely inspired with this in mind, but if we want to generate a strain that operates anywhere near pine tree resin, there is a caveat which must first be investigated.Pine tree resin contains (amongst many other things) a mixture of terpenes.The PICRUSt algorithm therefore precomputes the gene content of all known organisms in a reference database.The medium was used by a research group in India who were conducting very similar experiments, and they had had great success in isolating cellulose-degrading bacteria.This is done by estimating the unknown living relatives  gene content through their 16S sequence similarity to studied and sequenced organisms.PICRUSt works by predicting the gene families contained inside a bacterial or archaeal metagenome identified using 16S bacteria or archaeal sequencing.The illumina sequencer records each of these flashes of coloured light and is able to interpret this information to provide a DNA sequence.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We also built a Microbiome Map of Shubenacadie Wildlife Park, which took sequencing results from our project and incorporated them into an interactive tool to learn a bit more about microbiomes.This year we tried to have a few different focuses for our Human Practices, including an integrated project.We also reached out to the Advanced Education Minister of Nova Scotia in an effort to make iGEM a more sustainable effort for Atlantic Canadian University.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Bacterial Isolation, Metagenomic Library, and Terpene Experiments", "protocol": "", "result": "Next year we intend to move forward with the metagenomic library and isolate more enzymes that would be useful for converting soft-wood lumber waste to a source of efficient fuel (ethanol) or be useful for bioremediation.Using the cellulose media, we plated porcupine fecal samples to inspect which species could be cultivated and would degrade cellulose.It can be seen in figure 3 that the transketolase enzyme and the starch phosphorylase enzyme are found with higher proportion in the arctic wolf and coyote samples than in the beaver and porcupine samples.This information provides some evidence that our future metagenomic library will be a fruitful endeavour.It can be noticed that the beaver and porcupine microbiomes have significantly higher proportions of these cellulose degrading enzymes than the arctic wolf or coyote microbiomes.We also did a second analysis looking at enzymes found at a higher proportion in the arctic wolf and coyote.For bioremediation, however, a different species of bacteria should be used to screen the metagenomic library (because E. coli can survive terpenes).All of the above results, for both E. coli and S. cerevisiae are summarized in Figure 4 below.This year we had a bit of time to perfect the metagenomic library protocol.We were able to grow many colonies on the cellulose media plates, showing us that there are many cellulose bacteria in the porcupine gut.The colony PCR that was done with the cellulose-degrading colonies can be seen on the gel to the left.They came from the porcupine fecal sample, on two separate cellulose plates grown aerobically at 37 degrees celcius.Other colony PCR experiments were done on three different colony morphologies found on the porcupine fecal sample cellulose plate: white colonies, yellow colonies and red bulls-eye colonies.Making a beaver microbiome metagenomic library should yield plenty of useful cellulose-degrading enzymes.We found that the commercial stuff contained mostly D-Limonene, as well as a variety of other terpenes (with alpha-pinene being present in very trace amounts).We also created a couple of new biobricks containing enzymes that we identified bioinformatically from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, a cellulose degrader identified in the porcupine microbiome.A series of culturing tubes were innoculated with E. coli and varying amounts of the terpenic extract were added; we started at a concentration of 4.3 mg/mL and worked our way down, and then measured turbidity -- and found no inhibition.We should be able to screen this library for cellulose degrading enzymes as well as terpene degrading enzymes that could prove useful in our search for new biofuel feedstocks and production solutionsWe have been able to provide evidence that a metagenomic library from DNA extracted from porcupine fecal samples would provide us with a new source of cellulose degrading enzymes.We therefore conclude that E. coli is very resistant to the anti-microbial properties of pine tree resin, and that the terpenes would not interfere with our goals for cellulose degradation.In comparison, the terpenic extract contained mostly alpha-pinene and beta-pinene in a 3:1 ratio.We tested for bacterial inhibition first by simply culturing E. coli on solid media with a dab of pine tree resin in the center.We showed that growth of an E. coli strain used to degrade soft-wood lumber waste would not be inhibited by the anti-microbial properties of terpenes found in trees milled for softwood lumber.We expected we would find a zone of inhibition, but did not observe such a thing.After isolating the terpenic extract from the resin, we repeated similar experiments by soaking into Whatman filter paper and placing it in the culturing plate.This can be seen in B of figure 1 below.We did a PICRUSt analysis on this 16S data from 4 animals in the park whose microbiomes we re-sequenced.The next step would be to actually attempt the metagenomic library and search for the enzymes we have been able to identify bioinformatically.With the brown streak pattern and the lactose fermenting we labelled this bacterium as likely a Sphingomonas sp.The high-throughput sequencing part of our project was done mostly to provide evidence for the feasibility of creating a metagenomic library from microbiome DNA.With this new protocol we believe that we will be able to build the metagenomic library using DNA Extracted from porcupine fecal sample and transforming that library into E. coli.We also did an extensive proof of concept for our plan to use microbiomes as a \"mine\" for enzymes and gathered evidence that it would, likely, enable us to identify genes that encode cellulose degrading enzymes.After 16S sequencing the yellow colony was identified as Escherichia coli and the red bulls-eye colony was identified as Stenotrophomonas rhizophila.These resequenced samples included the beaver, the porcupine, the arctic wolf and the coyote.The results are documented in detail on our Proof of Concept page.We were able to sequence the microbiomes of 21 mammals from the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park with the help of the Integrated Microbiome Resource at Dalhousie University.We found that the microbiomes of animals that are of similar families, or are closely related evolutionarily, correlate with the similarity of their microbiomes.The sequencing of the white colony morphology proved challenging.", "safety": "Because of this, we had many resources for maintaining our health and safety such as Dalhousie\u0092s

the handbook turned to focus on pathogenesis, transmission, and prevention measures of mosquito-borne diseases; besides, we adapted the procedures of treatment to affected parts into cartoon, so that the public can read and understand it easily.Through the revising and communication on the handbook, we deepened our understanding that prevention and treatment of mosquito-borne diseases can not be achieved by a small group of people in a few days; it is a long journey, a huge project that involves whole human beings.As the people also living in mosquito-borne diseases endemic area, we hope we can do something for the people in African continent thousands miles away.After we finished the English handbook, we managed to get in touch with the Chinese educator in Zambia on social network, explained our project to him and showed our willing to cooperate.We decide to explore the way to alleviating mosquito-borne diseases transmission from the point of science and education and to set it as the main part of HUMAN PRACTICE program.May 2016, we distributed questionnaires about mosquito-borne diseases in China at first.6.Interview in Fujian Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0August 31st, in order to ensure the academic rigor of the handbook, we went to Fujian Center for Disease Control and Prevention and invited mosquito-borne diseases expert, Haibao Xu, to revise the content.In the first edition of the handbook, we compiled the collected literature and arranged relevant knowledge on mosquito species, distribution areas, disease transmission, protection against mosquito, and rumor clarification.The iGEM and the synthetic biology are known by the public gradually.In order to let more people to know us as well as getting in touch with us, we optimized our platform on WeChat and Sina Microblog.We could not predict the result of it, but we were looking forward to it.Receiving the response that they were glad to cooperate with us, the whole team was so inspiring: carrying our dream and hope, the handbooks finally could travel across oceans to a wonderful land where we could not reach to.We expressed that we wanted to send our English handbooks to the educational institution where he was working and hoped he can help us to distribute these handbooks to the people there.At the beginning of July, we completed the first edition of the handbook.Being inspired, we came back to our lab and carried out the second edition of handbook immediately.From the statistics and analysis of the result, we found many people did not know basic mosquitoes  knowledge, such as mosquito species, mosquito distribution area.Meanwhile, it is a though public health problem.\u0094 With the deepening of the experimental process and the increase of reading volumes, we firmly believe what WHO reported.In the half a day, we have obtained too much, and more importantly, we recognized the core of human practice program, which is enthusiasm.In the class, we talked about the development of Synthetic Biology, basics for Bioinformatics, methods in Molecular Biology and so on.We presented useful information in a more concise and clearer way, focused on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases and deleted mosquito eradication methods that can not be applied locally.We offered the service of answering the questions on the iGEM and the synthetic biology from our school\u0092s students and sent the news of the Frontier Science Program sometimes.The followers of our platform can acquire a lot of useful information about the synthetic biology and iGEM from us.During the winter holiday at the beginning of 2016, our team held several times public lectures in our school.Watching at the photos and short videos from Zambia in the e-mail, our hearts were full of appreciation.We affirmed our belief: insignificant as we are, we should never give up any chances which may make differences; we should keep striving to make a better and brighter future for the world.At here, we grasped a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of health education and working procedures, learned the enthusiasm for health education career, and gained the methods of health education as well as guiding concept.With the curiosity of those questions, we waited for the response restlessly.About a week later, we received the e-mail from Zambia.How can we convey our common expectations to the people in other countries?Our answer is to make an English version of the handbook.October 2015, our team held the info session at the College of Plant Protection and the College of Life Sciences in our school to share the information on the synthetic biology with lots of students under the help of school.When Zika virus becomes the focal point of the world, malaria, the mosquito-borne diseases which have tortured human beings for hundreds of years, is still alive, even though we have already developed and promoted antimalarial drugs like Artemisinin.As the first team joined the iGEM in Fuzhou, the reports of our team\u0092s story not only encourage the students in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, but also motivate many students in other schools.The aim of the public lectures is to improve students\u0092 interests on the biology.This result led to the idea of producing a handbook about protection against mosquitoes, which covers basic knowledge of mosquito-borne diseases and demonstrates a certain amount of frontier anti-mosquitoes technology.All the students in our school can come to have these lectures for free.With these efforts, more and more students learn about the synthetic biology, and most of them would like to take part in the iGEM competition.Except that, we made survey about mosquitoes among public, visiting Center for Disease Control, interview experts in the related filed.We will introduce our Human Practice project in the timeline.From October to November, our team accepted the interview both from the newspaper and the school radio station.Although there are still some problems, it is already a great leap compared to the first one.Our second edition gained recognition in the promotion.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Before the first week, we cultivated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.We sent our reserved parts to SYSU-CHINA team and ShanghaiTechChina_B team to help them to finish project.We distributed questionnaires about mosquito-borne diseases in China.We designed primers for \u00a0Cry4a,Cry10a, Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2,EGFP genes.The greens in the figure are positive for transformation.We designed the qPCR primers use of detection Cry4a,Cry10a,Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2 genes expression.The genes from Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis strain BRC-LLP29Molecular cloning of Cry4a,Cry4b,Cry10a, Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2,EGFP genes.Vector is pChlamy-3.Analysis of Negative Result?\u00a0Annealing reaction was not set.", "protocol": "Transfer the upper colourless aqueousphase into a new 1.5ml EP tube(RNase-Free).6.Add 250?l isopropanol, turn the tube upside down many times for around10 min, and let it sit at room temperature for 10 min until the white flocculearise,and then centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4?.7.Discard the supernatant,add 500?l,75%ethanol with DEPC,and mixthoroughly.Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4? and discard the supernatant.8.Dry it at room temperature or in the bechtop for 15 min.9.Add 15-20?l RNase-Free water to dissolve RNA when the precipitate becometransparent.Attention: All team members just can feeding the larvae of mosquitoes.While the transformation mixtures are incubating, add 5 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature into each well of a 6-well plate.Note: You will divide each transformation mixture between two wells of a 6-well plate after electroporation, so that the cells in each transformation mixture will recover in 10 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution total.9.Vortex vigorously for 10 second.Note: presence of small amount of unlysed cells would not affect the quality of the samples.Add appropriate amounts of buffer B (1/10 of buffer A) to the lysate and vortex vigorously for 10 seconds.Transfer/pour the cell lysate to pre-chilled filter cartridge, and centrifuge in a microcentrifuge at 14,000-16,000 rpm for 30 seconds.The clear cell lysate in collection tube is ready to use.Split the transformation mixture into two aliquots of 125 ?L each and transfer each aliquot into one well of the 6-well plate containing 5 mL/well of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature.(~30 mins)The larvae are fed every day with food C.

collector with bacteria attached to it on its functionality.For the first time in history, the global demand for fresh water is overtaking its supply in many parts of the world.Having access to clean water is a fundamental human right.", "design": "As we can print our 3D shape in many different sizes, bottles of all sizes and shapes can be used as a water reservoir.As the biological function of the device can deteriorate over time, you will have to renew your dewpal from time to time, meaning we are still creating plastic waste.Overall, dewpal is comparable to the fog catchers in Peru, however, thanks to the INP that is attached via synthetic biology approaches, the atmospheric water capturing capabilities are expected to be higher when the dewpal collectors can be printed on full scale.The main reason that our dewpal is better than Watergen is because it needs no electricity.There is Watergen, a company that describes its vision as follows: \u0093Water-gen\u0092s vision is to provide humanity with an abundant, renewable source of fresh, clean drinking water, by extracting it directly from the air, our most abundant water resource.\u0094 The products they develop, however, need electricity, which is not always and everywhere available in Third World Countries.A comparison in the quantity of water the dewpal water collector catches and price still need to be made.Also, as you can see in following simulation, the shape can be screwed on all sorts of water bottles so that the water can immediately be collected.Our project wants to design an optimized modular shape/surface for condensation and subsequent freshwater collection by gravity to solve the fact that in 2025, more than half of the countries in the world will be experiencing water shortage.Our dewpal device consists of a 3D printed shape with a screwcap so it can be attached to water bottles.This means that apart from the catchers, water tanks still need to be installed to provide the community with water in the months where no fog is formed.The U.N. predicts that by 2025, more than half of the countries in the world will be experiencing water stress or outright shortages.The biological functional half sphere of your dewpal can be disconnected from your screwcap bottom, meaning the screwcap bottom could have a nearly endless life time, while only the biologically functional part would need replacement from time to time.We tweaked this design so the air can enter our shape (see picture below), meaning we can collect more water than just the basic  full sphere  structure as it has a larger active surface area.As we already have the bacteria with INP attached, these only need to be cultured, which also shouldn t be too big of a cost.As for the water collection, we see our dewpal competing with the other projects once we get to full printing size.There is also need for piping to guide the water from the catchers to the water tanks.A pump is attached for easy access to the water.By building 5 fog catchers and planting over 1000 trees they were able to use water that was otherwise not used (from the fog), instead of water from the dwindling aquifers in Lima.A downside of the fogcatchers is that the presence of fog is an absolute must for the devices to collect water.This turbine directs air into the underground condensation chamber, where water is collected.Note that this design isn t implemented yet by our shape group, but will be in the future.The planted trees, by self-irrigating, help the restoration of the natural water cycle in the region.A major downside to the WaterSeer project is that a hole of two meters needs to be dug out to install the device.The former United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, states the  Lack of access to water for drinking, hygiene and food security inflicts enormous hardship on more than one billion members of the human family .As our project is developed for use in areas where water is scarce and these areas often coincide with developing and third world countries, electricity will not be freely available at any time.By doing this, our device has a positive impact on reducing plastic waste, as empty plastic bottles can now be used as a water reservoir, prolonging their life as such.It consists of a device that is planted at two meter under the ground, with a wind turbine head that sits above the ground.As millions of people are living in areas with water scarcity, our device could impact the life of all of them.Having access to fresh water is a fundamental human right.Being able to functionalize 3D printed shapes with biologicals has an ambundance of potential applications.There are already some potential solutions to water scarcity based on atmospheric water generation:There are fog catchers in Lima, Peru.No piping is needed as gravity makes the water flow through a series of collectors to a plastic bottle acting as a water reservoir.", "human_practice": "As we can print our 3D shape in many different sizes, bottles of all sizes and shapes can be used as a water reservoir.As the biological function of the device can deteriorate over time, you will have to renew your dewpal from time to time, meaning we are still creating plastic waste.As the purpose of our project was to contribute to a solution to the growing water shortage problem, we started delving into the literature, contacted experts in the various fields (3D printing, atmospheric water collection, ...) and had frequent brainstorm sessions with the team.We therefore definitely believe that we have the necessary ingredients (a cheap, small, easy to use & easy to stack device) in our dewpal recipe to become a game changer in the field of water collection.As the water gets collected, there will be a small risk that the attached bacteria will also find their way into the collected water as the bond between the biotin on the shape and the streptavidin on the bacteria is a very strong.As often done in practice, the vectors in our experiments are not self transducible, avoiding genetic material from being easily transferred.In one approach of our project we have attaching modified E. coli Top10 cells to our water collector.Throughout the course of the project we used his expertise as a guide for the designing and fine tuning of our model.The biological functional half sphere of your dewpal can be disconnected from your screwcap bottom, meaning the screwcap bottom could have a nearly endless life time, while only the biologically functional part would need replacement from time to time.Apart from providing easy and cheap access to clean drinking water, the sustainability and development of crops would also benefit enormously which in turn helps the economical situation in those countries.The benefits of the wide use of our dewpal device are huge.Note that this design isn t implemented yet by our shape group, but will be in the future.Our dewpal device consists of a 3D printed shape with a screwcap so it can be attached to water bottles.Around 1900 only 2% of the world population was under chronic water shortage while currently more than 1 billion people suffer from physical water scarcity and a quarter of the human population lack sufficient water due to economical reasons, such as the lack of infrastructure to take water from rivers and aquifers (Kummu et.It gave us the necessary determination to continue the work with true passion and dedication.Already from the beginning we had frequent conversations with Prof. Dan Fernandez, a leader in the field of atmospheric water collection.He shared his knowledge on 3D printing with us which led to significant improvements of the collector, more specifically on how the water is drained towards the centre of the shape.As the project went on, and after getting in touch with several humanitarian aid organisations (Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen, Protos, ... ), we had the growing believe that we could influence the lives of millions of people with the dewpal project.In the dewpal project, these strains are genetically engineered.Nevertheless, one should be aware of the public perception related to the use of GMOs for biotechnological applications, although it is in general less problematic compared to GMO plants or animals.All experiments were carried out in a contained laboratory environment (GMO-class 2 laboratory).Bacteria often have the capability of transferring genetic material, especially when self-transmissible vectors are used.We soon realized that the water scarcity problem is bigger than previously thought and generally assumed.Additionally, the device can be produced locally, if 3D-printers and filament are available or can be provided, reducing environmental and economic costs.By doing this, our device has a positive impact on reducing plastic waste, as empty plastic bottles can now be used as a water reservoir, prolonging their life as such.The cells themselves will not be used in applications, but only the cell-free bio-molecules they produce.The first could be to add a killing switch to the bacteria, or make the E. coli auxotrophic.This is exactly what we did with the Dewpal project: our shape is printed in cheap but sturdy materials resulting in low production costs, especially in mass production.This brings along no additional risk as the engineered strains are merely used as \u0091cell factories\u0091 in an enclosed environment.Additionally, in regions of physical water scarcity the average income per capita is rather low which hinders the development of infrastructures to collect freshwater (for example by filtering seawater) (see following picture).To improve the life quality of those billions of people, it is essential to create a cheap and efficient device to passively collect freshwater.During our project we also developed a new type of 3D printing material, but in order to make this into a useable filament, we needed a filament extruder.Furthermore, the environment will not be exposed to these modified organisms thanks to contained use and standard GLP.Also, since consuming polluted water and consequent diseases are a major hindrance in education, having access to sufficient clean drinking water will improve the level of education in those areas.Water scarcity is a major and growing problem worldwide.", "modeling": "This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in

simulation lab.Apart from our team, the people residing in this lab are specialized in developing mathematical models for a wide variety of applications such as waste water treatment, bioinformatics and urban air quality monitoring.As often done in practice, the vectors in our experiments are not self transducible, avoiding genetic material from being easily transferred.For our project, in one approach we are attaching modified E. coli Top10 cells to our water collector.Nevertheless, one should be aware of the public perception related to the use of GMOs for biotechnological applications, although it is in general less problematic compared to GMO plants or animals.All experiments were carried out in a contained laboratory environment (GMO-class 2 laboratory).Under the expert supervision of Kurt Van Houtte, FabLab s coordinator, a handful of 3D-printers were put to work for the creation of dewpal water collectors in all sizes and shapes.Our bacteria, Escherichia coli strain DH5a, Escherichia coli Top10 and Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 are standard non-pathogenic laboratory bacteria belonging to risk group 1.In addition, every member of our team got a (bio)safety and waste disposal training before performing our experiments in the lab.During the eventual execution of our experiments, we were supervised by our instructors who made sure we performed everything according to the safety regulations.Due to the diverse nature of the expert knowledge in this lab, it is an ideal environment for the development of out-of-the-box ideas for the computer-aided design of the dewpal and humidistat.Most of the dewpal prototypes were 3D-printed at UGent s FabLab, were an assortment of tools, 3D-printers and other computer controlled machines are available for this cause.All activities of this committee take place in close consultation with, amongst others, the facultary Environment, Hygiene and Safety Committee, the facultary Ethics Committee and with some Rectoral Services.In addition we have committed ourselves to both the national legal and ethical requirements compliance and the international and EU regulation compliance:Environmental regulation:

water.Bacteria often have the capability of transferring genetic material, especially when self-transmissible vectors are used.In the dewpal project, these strains are genetically engineered.This brings along no additional risk as the engineered strains are merely used as \u0091cell factories\u0091 in an enclosed environment.Furthermore, the environment will not be exposed to these modified organisms thanks to contained use and standard GLP.Our experimental work is done in a GMO class 2 laboratory at the Department Biochemical and Microbial Technology at Ghent University.The Faculty of

Coli and sufficient for leupeptin production.LeupA has a predicted product similar in weight to the predicted 260 kDa for leupeptin synthase.Finally, natural leupeptin producers degrade leupeptin in the stationary phase, meaning we could see much higher yields with heterologous expression.We obtained three S. roseus strains and attempted to amplify leupA and leupB from the genome using primers to add the entire RFC[10] prefix and suffix, designed using the unassembled genome sequence of strain ATCC 31245.Both ocimene itself and E. coli with our pathway would be tested by the Crow Lab at Georgia State University for inhibition of P. destructans.Unfortunately, we were unable to assemble these plasmids for submission to the parts registry.Antifungals could kill fungi which compete with P. destructans on the bats\u0092 skin, or disrupt cave function.We instead began our plan for defending bats from White Nose Syndrome with the volatile compound ocimene.Additionally, the single ocimene synthase gblock was designed for direct RFC[10] digestion and ligation, with flanking VF2 and VR sites for amplification using existing primers.Leupeptin acid reductase was noted to always elute with leupeptin acid synthetase, and had an estimated weight of 320 kDa, almost identical to the combined weights of LeupA and B.Unfortunately, the biosynthesis of most protease inhibitors remains a mystery, but a recent preprint purports to have found a gene cluster in Streptomyces roseus responsible for the synthesis of leupeptin, commonly used in protease inhibitor cocktails (and expensive).Analysis of the P. destructans secretome found a serine endopeptidase, destructin-1, responsible for much of the fungus  ability to degrade collagen in bats\u0092 skin.The domains of leupA and B have homology to proteins with condensation actions similar to those proposed for the synthesis of leupeptin, including arginine and leucine.Our issue was exacerbated when no PCR primers were ordered for the amplification of individual gblocks, and stocks eventually ran out.These pathways were constructed from the codon-optimized genes of Enterococcus faecalis, Methanosarcina mazei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli, with one designed for optimum flux and the other providing extensibility for synthesis of other terpenes.PCR did not appear to amplify the desired products under a variety of conditions, with the long additions making the primers too long for use with the template, which has a GC content of over 70%.Bats with the fungus that survive until arousal in the spring have demonstrated an ability to recover from the disease.Finally, the codon-optimized ocimene synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana would be assembled in an additional plasmid to catalyze the final step of ocimene synthesis.We ruled out most candidates for leucine acetyltransferase that could have been included in the 70 kbp vector with BLAST results to known genes except for a 18.84 kDa hypothetical protein, which differs significantly from the 27 kDa observed previously and occurs upstream rather than downstream as Barona-G\u00f3mez suggested two additional genes may be.By 2012, the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimated at least 6 million bats had already succumbed to the disease, while state and federal agencies have scrambled to close off caves and protect unaffected bat populations.Additionally, damage to the thin wing membranes hinders flight while inducing a variety of physiological changes and inflammation.For an interactive map of the spread of

were negative controls and demonstrate that no residual EtBr was present in the absence of DNA bonded to the glass.Figure 1 shows that EtBr localized in the regions where DNA was added to the slides.This indicates that there is at least some DNA present on these slides after the wash.It is possible to state that this is the the newly ligated oligonucleotide, a combination of both the 52mer and the 23mer.It is unclear whether or not the DNA washed off or just the EtBr.To recap, the RNA Ligation is an important step our system because it provides mean for PCR amplification of the newly assembled oligonucleotide.As a control, the second type of reaction is between a 52mer and a 43mer without any extra phosphate(This was done to also show that an extra phosphate was necessary for the ligation of both oligos).Figure 2 shows 4 different glass slides that underwent a wash step similar to the ones that would be done by the loomino device.Then, appropriate primers and PCR elements are added to the reaction chamber to amplify this newly formed sequence of DNA.The bottom two slides show slight orange fluorescence highlighted by the black boxes superimposed on the image.On each slide, the number of oranges circles corresponds to the number and location of the regions DNA was added to.Samples were sent out for sequencing to confirm that the proper sequences were present in the plasmids.At this point, we only need to purify the proteins from the Rosetta cells and test them on oligonucleotides to make sure they function properly.Sequences for the three different forms of TdT

been complicated by the absence of available replicative plasmid forBacillus subtilis in the registry.After digestion by EcoRI and PstI and ligation in the pSB1C3 plasmid, the resulting pSB1C3-OriKan plasmid was obtained (right part of the figure).The fragment was then sub-cloned in the pSB1C3 plasmid (between the EcoRI/PstI restriction sites).We checked the capacity of this new pSB1C3-Orikan plasmid to maintain in Bacillus subtilis and wewere delighted to obtain clones.This new plasmid wasthen used to create most of the Bacillus subtilis parts of our project, demonstrating itsefficiency as a new backbone for Bacillus based projects.OriKan (new part BBa_K1937002): and they all became Bacillus plasmids\u0085With the success of the pSBBS0K-Mini, we decided that we should try to go even

steps.Moreover, we are also very proud of the OriKan biobrick.PCR on colonies was performed using primers hybridizing in the kanamycine resistance gene and in the suffix.", "design": "Besides, Bacillus species are inhabitants of the cave (Martin-Sanchez et al, 2014) and Bacillus subtilis is a model microorganisms with well-established genetic possibilities, i.e, the perfect chassis for our project (Figure 2).Figure 2: In the cave, Pseudomonas species degrade the antifungal molecules previously used to prevent mould apparition.Our Bacillus strain will develop from Pseudomonas, and in contact to fungi, will produce antifungal molecules to prevent mould development.Two independent operons have been reported to allow for the predation property of Bacillus subtilis: the sporulation killing factor (skf) and the sporulation delay protein (sdp) (Gonzalez-Pastor et al, 2003; Ellermeier et al, 2006; Gonzalez-Pastor, 2011).NheI, SacII and SalI restrictions sites were added to further facilitate the modules assembly.To express the antifungal peptides only in presence of the fungi, we selected the Bacillus promoter of nagA and nagP, reported to be induced in presence of NAG (Bertram et al., 2011).5 different molecules were selected:- D4E1, a 17 amino acids synthetic peptide analog to Cecropin B AMPs which has been shown to have antifungal activities by complexing with a sterol present in the conidia\u0092s wall of numerous fungi (De Lucca et al, 1998).We also designed the toxin/antitoxin systems in a way that one of the toxin gene could be inserted in the middle of the antifungal operon (SacII/SalI insertion, figure 8).These lead us to divide our project in three modules (Containment, Predation, Antifungal; Figure 1).Figure 1: Bacillus subtilis transformed with the two plasmids carrying the elements necessary to promote predation, to prevent the plasmid dissemination, and to produce antifungals molecules.The Lascaux history has proved that any molecule addition could result in major and unexpected modifications of the cave microbiota.One plasmid contains antitoxin 1 and toxin 2, the other contains antitoxin 2 and toxin 1.Figure 6: concept of the double toxin/antitoxin system.The two pairs of Toxin-Antitoxin combinations selected for this project are MazF/MazE (Bravo et al., 1987, Zhang et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2013) and Zeta/Epsilon (Zielenkiewicz and Ceg?owski, 2005 ; Mutschler et al., 2011).Since their expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, we decided to replace their promoter by pVeg for a constitutive expression (Figure 3).This molecule is the major component of chitin found at the surface of the fungi.To simplify the cloning, we designed two genetics modules: Antifungal A and Antifungal B. Antifungal A expresses the cut Metchnikowin and D4E1, while Antifungal B produces entire Metchnikowin, GAFP-1 and Dermaseptin-b1 (figure 4).We circumvented this difficulty by taking advantage of the predatory property of Bacillus subtilis: in starvation condition, one program of Bacillus is to produce toxins to kill other bacteria such as Pseudomonas species and to develop from their materials (Nandy et al, 2007).As we did not know if this cleavage is essential for the antifungal activity, we choose to use either the cut or entire form of this peptide (Levashina et al, 1995).Since treating with antifungal molecules has proved to be at the best a limited option, we wonder about how to produce antifungal in a targeted and efficient way.Since a variety of mould has been identified to cause problem in the cave, we wanted a wide spectrum solution and decided for an antifungal cocktail.The toxin and antitoxin are under control of the pVeg constitutive promoter for Bacillus subtilis (BBa_K143012; Figure 5).The EcoRI/NheI fragment containing a pNag promoter (figure 5) will have to be swapped with the EcorI/NheI fragment containing the pVeg promoter of the antifungal operon (figure 4).This peptide is membranotropic and depolarizes the fungi plasma membrane (Fleury et al, 1998).- GAFP-1 (Gastrodia Anti Fungal Protein 1), a mannose and chitin binding lectin originating from the Asiatic orchid Gastrodia elata, that inhibits the growth of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungal plant pathogens (Wang et al, 2001).For example, the antifungal molecules abundantly used to fight against fungi infection have been degraded by Pseudomonas fluorescens, and this degraded molecules are used by fungi to proliferate\u0085 A major constraint we imposed to our project was thus to avoid adding nutriment in the cave.25: 651\u0096661Our project involved release of a genetically modified bacteria in the cave.The description of the device structure and use is available in the Modeling section.All the parts from the three modules were designed to be easily assembled (Figure 9).To valid the expression and specificity of these promoters, the RFP reporter gene has been placed under their control (Figure 5).These sequences encodes the necessary elements to produce, mature and secrete the killing factors, as well as the immunity agents to prevent lethality of the producing cells.Ellermeier CD, Errett CH, Gonzalez-Pastor JE, and Losick R (2006) A Three-Protein Signaling Pathway Governing Immunity to a Bacterial Cannibalism Toxin.RFP expression was also added in prevision of a visualisation of the strain during test on stones.Figure 3: Predation constructions.44: 514\u0096520 Fleury Y, Vouille V, Beven L, Amiche M, Wr\u00f3blewski H, Delfour A & Nicolas P (1998) Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and gene structure of a novel member of the dermaseptin B family.It was mandatory to ensure the best confinement strategy for our strain, to limit the material input in the cave and to ensure antifungal production only when required.The rationale for this was to have the toxin as close as possible to the antifungal molecule to further reduce the risk of antifungal gene horizontal transfer.For the secretion of these antifungal compounds, we added the AmyE signal peptide in N-terminal of each coding sequences.NheI restrictions sites were added to further facilitate the modules assembly.Bertram R, Rigali S, Wood N, Lulko AT, Kuipers OP & Titgemeyer F (2011) Regulon of the N-acetylglucosamine utilization regulator NagR in Bacillus subtilis.This has two valuable advantages: (i) no substrate are required when using the bacteria, and (ii) our Bacillus will reduce the deleterious population of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Martin-Sanchez et al, 2011).The device has been designed to be stuck on the cave wall and to be easily manipulated.Finally, if we decided to use the common Bacillus subtilis 168 strain for the modules validation, the final chassis was choosen to be a double mutant Spo0A- recA-.581: 151\u009656.The Paleotilis project main idea is to contain the fungi patch progression in the Lascaux cave.Identification of components of a new stability system of plasmid R1, ParD, that is close to the origin of replication of this plasmid.It is unusual in the sense theophylline riboswitches usually work in the inverse way (Topp and Gallivan, 2008).Developing a biological solution to protect one of the most invaluable humanity heritage is a beautiful challenge.The risk to release a GMO in the cave is mainly in the horizontal gene transfer to native bacteria.Since each fragment contains a toxin but not its corresponding antitoxin, we needed a strategy to avoid cell death during the cloning steps.Besides, we wanted to express these peptides only in close vicinity of the fungi.We decided for a double toxin-antitoxin system (Figure 6).Indeed, at this step of the project, the risk about using this GMO in the cave is unknown.193: 3525\u00963536 De Lucca AJ, Bland JM, Grimm C, Jacks TJ, Cary JW, Jaynes JM, Cleveland TE & Walsh TJ (1998) Fungicidal properties, sterol binding, and proteolytic resistance of the

construction during the validation assays.The SacII and SalI restriction sites were added to simplify the modules assembly.Figure 7: toxin/antitoxin constructions for each plasmidBravo A, de

"Thus, the Lascaux cave is a work of art, it deserves to exist, to be maintained and protected.We should never consider Nature and living beings solely as work tools.In the European Union, the legal definition of GMO is mentioned in the 2001/18 directive: a GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) is \u0093an organism, with the exception of human beings, whose genetic makeup has been modified via methods that do not occur in nature and/or through traditional crossbreeding methods\u0094.However, the regulation regarding GMOs varies from a country to another as far as research, production, marketing and their use are concerned.Indeed, at the time of the Renaissance, an interesting definition of art appears: it is a disinterested and free activity, pleasant in itself, having no utility for production.However, after getting in touch with scientists and people working in the Lascaux cave, it turned out that we will be able to test our genetically modified bacteria in a \"cave test\".Among others, we contacted Yvan Mo\u00ebnne-Loccoz, part of the scientific council of the Lascaux cave and Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle Director of the National Museum of Prehistory.It is obvious that any project involving the release of genetically modified bacteria in an ecosystem, needs an in-depth studies to evaluate the evolution of the ecosystem following the addition of a genetically modified native bacterium.Although the issues raised by OGM in the public mainly concern plants (GMP) and more recently also animals (GMA) including Human because of the ease of manipulate organisms with the powerful CRISPR-Cas9 tools, we need to think about the ethics of our iGEM project and share our thinking with the public.To fuel our thinking, beside reading few publications, we were lucky enough to be able to regularly discuss with Dr Vincent Gr\u00e9goire-Delory, Head of the \u0093Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d\u0092Ethique des Sciences\u0094 in Toulouse.It belongs to no one and is not the object of desire: it is there for contemplation of a generation, and then transmitted to the next.These frescoes show the representation that men had of their world 18,000 years ago.It carries a message and a memory of the Paleolithic man.Some philosophers of aesthetics, defined art as \"sensitive knowledge\": an autonomous knowledge which is opposed to knowledge through concepts.Thus, it is necessary to know what might be the impact of our modified microorganism on the environment before using it to treat the caves.For the artist, art is also used to escape and to express themselves.It is through the power and intelligence of men that we can organize the formless and chaos of the real world in a style, an expression.Against this statistic and for modestly contribute to the fight for men-women parity, we would like to demonstrate that only complementary skills are the secret ingredient to the success in this competition, beyond the gender.At the heart of the synthetic biology iGEM competition is the modification of microorganisms and therefore the creation of genetically modified microorganisms (GMM), a sub-category of the genetically modified organisms (OGM) that also include higher organisms such as animals and plants.Alongside more traditional methods currently used against these fungi, we decided to act with the most modern means from this emerging science that is synthetic biology, to contribute to the preservation of an ancient heritage and to ensure its transmission to future generations.Whatever would be the answer, we believe that respecting living beings first and foremost rests on scientific integrity and rigor, a realization of all the implications of the scientific project, the precise knowledge of its content, and finally the establishment of security measure.This art does not represent the time of the hunting scenes as one might imagine.While participating to an exhibition on genetics at the \u0093Museum d\u0092Histoire Naturelle\u0094 in Toulouse, we also have had the opportunity to discuss with Dr Anne Cambon-Thomsen, Head of the \u0093Plateforme G\u00e9n\u00e9tique & Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u0094 of Toulouse and member of European ethics committees.From all these readings and discussions, we realized that as far as ethics issues are concerned, there are two main point of views, anthropocentrism vs biocentrism, that would deeply impact on the outcome of any debate.General considerations.Is it a lack of respect to nature and the living in general to insert a gene controlling insulin production into a bacterium if that means saving thousands of human lives?Let\u0092s not forget that the Lascaux cave is not an usual work of art, not only by age but especially by the presence of life.Like the links of a long human chain, the Lascaux cave shows to future generations a work executed by ancient men.In spite of the absence of definite answer, we can question ourselves differently: when is an organism considered \u0093modified\u0094?We have also participated to a workshop on Genetically Modified Microorganism organized by the \u0093Plateforme G\u00e9n\u00e9tique & Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u0094 whose guest stars were Pr Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent from Paris, members of ethics committees and Pr.However, it is sometimes difficult to quantify the risks and visualize the limit between what could be really dangerous for humanity and what is not.Thereby, thanks to the awareness raised to this debate, numerous precautions have been taken to avoid the dissemination of GMOs, because the scientific community does not know their exact effects on the environment.Will we actually counteract this law of nature by saving the frescoes in the cave?In fact, the cave has a very complex ecosystem, diverse and constantly interacting.Places as amazing and diverse as the Serra da Capivara National Park in Brazil, the Pyramids of Egypt, Trogir historic town in Croatia are the heritage of our world.Sphinx and Chephren-Pyramid, Serra da Capivara National Park (Brazil), Historic city of TrogirAmong the 1052 world treasures that need to be saved, the Lascaux cave and the impressive frescos by their number and aesthetic quality are listed since October 1979 (ICOMOS Recommendation).Even today, ephemeral art is practiced for example in the Landart.However, efforts are still needed for a much fair treatment of women in order to grant full equality in all countries around the world.In the left: Caroline Herschel , in the right: Marie CurieThus today, what is happening is that only 8 young women are involved in the iGEM adventure in Toulouse.Formerly simply meaning \"study of the living\", it is now more complex because we are able to transform the living.Indeed, the walls of the cave are partially and gradually covered with black and white mushrooms that hide the frescoes.Respectively : Sand Art Festival Tossens, Localisation of the Lascaux cave, The lascaux caveWhy save art?He adds that if there are many consequences possible when using a technology, one has to decide [to use the technology or not] according to the most pessimistic hypothesis.In France, this principle is applied for the use of GMOs and allows avoiding to the maximum the risks endangering health and the environment.For many prehistorians, the cave is actually a sanctuary, a sort of religious monument.Not to say, we are quite proud of the results!Thus, Nietzsche promotes art as the purest and spiritual entertainment.There is no parietal cave in the world that matches it in terms of the quality and variety of the finds (skeletons, objects, flint, various utensils).This study shows that the ecosystem\u0092s modification in this project is not significant.It states that \u0093the lack of certainties, given the scientific and technical knowledge of the moment, shall not delay the adoption of effective and proportionate measures that aim to prevent a risk of severe and irreversible harm to the environment to a cost economically acceptable\u0094.This allowed the estimate of the risks associated with the future use of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) in crops.For the NASA, \u0093life is an auto-maintained system, capable of Darwinian evolution\u0094 (Gerald Joyce, 1992).It is thus important to act responsibly, with integrity and full conscience, and to evaluate the risks linked to using GMOs.The Lascaux caves since 1979 belongs to the World Heritage of UNESCO.The opening of the cave by humans causing an imbalance in the ecosystem, one would think it\u0092s only coherent that men attempt to repair their mistakes.The site is particularly interesting from ethnological, anthropological and aesthetic point of views, marking a milestone in the history of prehistoric art and our human culture.The questions raised are often linked to them, but the confusion is present and the reluctance seems to affect all GMOs.The risks are not the same for each category of GMOs, and to the best of our knowledge, for the moment no major health or environmental problems associated to MGMs have been reported despite more than 70 years of MGMs manipulation in academic or private laboratories.Regarding specifically the scientific area, many women have raised the flag of parity such as Caroline Herschel, the first woman recognized as scientist but also the first one to publish a scientific paper in 1786 about the discovery of a comet, or such as Marie Curie who obtained two Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry.Indeed, the ecosystem of the cave is very delicate and vital for the preservation of the frescoes.Indeed, one may think that science is useful only when it is in the service of health or the environment.This peculiar and quite funny situation has somehow triggered our thinkingabout the actual position of women in Science, specially taking into account that our principalResults of a vast survey on the role of women in scientific research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group were published in March 2014 in the European Union, show that only 11% of the highest academic posts are occupied by women in science subjects.As far as the iGEM competition is concerned, only genetically modified microorganisms are pertinent.Mahaffee, W. F. & Kloepper, J. W. Bacterial communities of the rhizosphere and endorhiza associated with field-grown cucumber plants inoculated with a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium or its genetically modified derivative.Indeed, the birth of synthetic biology has created a revolution in the world of biology as important as the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Watson and Crick or the first complete sequencing of a human genome in 2003.Indeed, American policy is based on the product of gene modification techniques, not on the process itself.It is with the PGMs that the debate has emerged.At the end of the selection process, it turned out that the most appropriate candidates were all women!As said before, the walls of the cave are partially and gradually covered with black and white fungi that hide the frescoes.Or maybe, we could be satisfied with the survival to transmit this work as long as possible to the future generations?It may be possible in the near future to get the same results for our project and why not imagine being able to reopen the cave to the public in the future?1.Actually the selection to be part of the team was made based on the skill and motivation of the student and not on his gender.These disappear with the tide and weather.Notwithstanding, wildlife depicted on walls of the cave does not match the species hunted and consumed at the time.A single reindeer engraved was found when it seems that it was very consumed at the time.P\u00e8re Puigdomenech from Barcelona, member of European ethics committees, co-organized by the \u0093Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, Inscriptions et Belles Lettres\u0094 of Toulouse.Thus it enables taking safety precautions even if the risk in question is not demonstrated or proven.It gives an encouraging result for the use of synthetic biology.Actually more than 300 definitions have been collected by the astrophysicist Radu Popa (2010).In France, the confined use of GMMs is subject, via the 2009/41/CE directive, to a system of notification and authorization.Indeed, others techniques exist at present to try to slow the progression of fungi in the Lascaux caves.The field of biology evolves very quickly thanks to the technological advances that we witness day by day.We need to remove the black and white fungi while preserving the balance of the ecosystem.A very interesting law was written in 1995: the Barnier\u0092s law, more known as the precautionary principle.Their irruption in the production processes went almost unnoticed.Clearly, women are underrepresented in scientific professions.Nevertheless, these percentages are slowly increasing, mainly because women are fighting for to reach the goal that the parity would be respected in all levels of society.We have also attended a seminar on genome editing given by the Pr.Moreover, despite all our efforts, the world tends toward entropy (second law of thermodynamics), which means that the universe tends toward disorder and disintegration.It is natural that suspicion emerges in the minds of the public when they only have a vague idea of ??what this new discipline is, and the safety measures implemented to minimize the risks.The regulation is based on other criteria than the ones applied inside the European Union.This prehistoric site is located in the French countryside.Still, the frescoes are extremely realistic in terms of morphology and attitudes of animals.In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Buddhist conceived mandalas (support for meditation and visualization, symbol of the universe) in the sand (very sensitive material overtime).Indeed, the World Heritage sites belong to everyone, irrespective of the territory in which they are located.In 1946, representatives of 37 countries met in London to sign and enforce the Constitution UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), defining the concept of world heritage and establishing an initial list of this heritage.They were even perceived well since they were able to engender more reliable products, as it was the case with the production of the growth hormone.The regulation is founded on verifiable risks and does not focus on the risks that were not proven (for more details see the precautionary principle).As mentioned in the introduction, distinction must be done between different kinds of GMOs (GMMs, PGMs, etc\u0085).", "modeling": "Therefore the simulation should help us know how much bacteria should be used to treat the mould patches, when the job is finished, and when the bacteria should have disappeared.It was designed has a simple interface (figure 2) and is totally open to the iGEM community and beyond (Link coming soon).Figure 2: image of the prey-predator model interface.The confinement device (figure 4) was designed has a transparent glass bell (5) mounted on a soft sucking pad (6) to stick to the cave wall.To predict how the strain will behave in the cave environment, we decided to use a modeling strategy and created a prey-predator model.These numbers will be implemented in the model to refine its prediction and hence optimize the approach until the results are satisfying enough to start test in laboratory caves.Perspectives: the laboratory cave and other applicationsThe described iterative approach will help to settle the best conditions to apply our project in the Lascaux cave.Each one of them could help respond to a particular issue of the Lascaux cave and all of them combined would tackle all the aspect of the Lascaux cave\u0092s situation.The concept of our project could be used for other applications as well.Optionally, an UV ramp could be mounted inside the chamber, either to reveal the bacteria if they express a fluorescent marker, or to ensure killing of the recA- Bacillus strain (this background allows reducing the risk of recombination \u0096 see the design part-, and is therefore very sensitive to UV).The device will have to be used during test on stone in laboratory condition.These caves are all located in France, and have similarities with the Lascaux cave in terms of bacterial and fungal populations.It means using the strain to treat mould patches as it would be done in the cave.However, each cave is unique and the microbiologists that work on the cave decided to develop a network of laboratory caves.Once satisfactory predictions are obtained, the next step toward the laboratory cave would be initiated.Figure 1: description of our strategy to anticipate the use of Paleolitis in the Lascaux cave.We conceived this step as an iterative strategy (figure 1).They therefore use laboratory caves where various treatments are performed and fully analysed before deciding to use them directly on the cave.There are experts in such approaches and we decided to focus on the step between the completion of our strain and this laboratory validation.The cave is very poor in growth substrates and the production of toxin should also make the bacteria unstable.They also do not act on the cave until they know the exact consequences of the treatments they plan on applying.We therefore assumed that the Paleolitis strain should not maintain in this environment.We designed a prey-predator model to predict how Paleolitis and the fungi will behave.Anyway, such a test could be easily adapted to try out the model predictions and the device functionality.Sampling during and after the predicted time could be done and qRT-PCR performed to measure how the fungal and bacterial populations evolved.At the end of our summer work, our strain Paleolitis was not complete yet.Bacterial suspension at the concentration indicated by the model is placed in the chamber (1).The device is placed on top of the mould patch and bacterial suspension is sprayed on the confined surface (figure 5) using the sprinkler inside the bell (3).We felt that we should use all the solutions available for the confinement and we designed a device to physically contain our strain during the treatment.We deposited on the stones several mixes including ochre, substrates, Bacillus subtilis expressing the antifungal AF_A operon, and fungi (figure 6).", "notebook": "Moreover, in order to reduce the size of our replicative plasmid pSB0K-P, we designed primers that were supposed to amplify both the origin of replication and the antibiotic resistance gene for B. subtilis and E. coli.The bacteria we are modifying is supposed to improve the predation capacity of B. subtilis.By amplifying by PCR pSB0K-P to select only the kanamycine gene and the replication origin in B. subtilis, and by ligating it with pSB1C3, we should obtain a plasmid replicative in E. coli and in B. subtilis.As the cloning with pNagA is validated, we started trying to clone this insert in the shuttle plasmid pSB0K-P from 2012 iGEM Munich team, and to transform it in E. coli.Thus, we start trying to clone the good amplicons in the backbone pSB1C3, but it fail because of a lack of genetic material.We asked to iGEM Munich 2012 to send us four shuttle backbones, that can be used in E. Coli as well as in B. subtilis.The bacteria that our B. subtilis is supposed to limit the growth is Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25.We have done PCR on the big pSB0K-P plasmid to reduce its size, from 9,3 kbp to 5,7 kbp, hoping the cloning will become easier.It was useful to determine if our B. subtilis is able to affect the growth of other bacteria.The plasmid pSB0K-Mini can be replicated in E. coli, but the antibiotic resistance functional in this bacterium is the ampicillin.For the modelling, we designed the prey-predator model to have a simulation of the activity of our modified B. subtilis.We continued trying to clone our insert pNagA in the shuttle plasmid pSB0K-P, using different strategies.The cloning of our three inserts in the pSB0K-Mini worked, and we also succeed in transforming B. subtilis with these constructions.The problems with the Gibson cloning are still present, but the origin of the disturbance is unknown.We started to test our promoter pNagA in B. subtilis.Due to these data we determined the doubling time of each conditions, and we selected the best one.Now that the small version of the plasmid pSB0K-P is circularized, we transformed it in Bacillus subtilis.In addition, the antibiotic resistance genes would be the one expected: chloramphenicol for E. coli, and kanamycine for B. subtilis.We used these strains in order to: have a positive control when our bacteria will be functional, test the efficiency of the antifungals, and find the best temperature, medium and technique.We started to clone our gBlocks pNagA, mazF and AfA in this plasmid.Problems with the cloning in pSB1C3 of our predation genes were still present.As the gBlocks were received, we did PCR to amplify them and create a stock.In order to determine if our bacteria is more efficient than the wild type bacteria, we have done predation tests by using the strain WT 168.We have done PCR, digestion, ligation, and transformation for clonings during a week, being supervised by PhD students.In parallel, we finished ordering gBlocks from IDT, and we refined the gene design.First of all, we had to digest the backbone pSB1C3, which have to received each of our parts.We designed it using Blender.The transformation of E. coli with the construction of a NagA inducible promoter in pSB1C3 worked, it was the first big step!The clonings did not work.As the PCR of gBlocks do not work very well, we designed other primers to improve the compatibility between the template and the primers.In 2014, the iGEM Toulouse team worked on fungi, and constructed strains able to secrete antifungals.We have done experiments realizing cultures in different conditions during the all day, and we measured the OD every hour.What we have done: ordered the material (enzymes, kit\u0085)necessary for the projectHaving a good control of the basic experiments, as enzymatic digestion or transformation for example, is important to ensure the lab work during the summer.We tried different programs, by modifying the elongation time or the hybridization temperature.The genes (sdp and skf) for our predation module should be cloned by the Gibson method.Dry lab: Now that the subject is defined, and that the bibliography is done, let\u0092s prepare our constructions!We also determined what was the more efficient between using the supernatant, the bacteria, or a mix of both.Nevertheless this plasmid is quite big (>9 kbp) and thus it is harder to clone than a smallest plasmid.", "protocol": "Transfer the GeneJET purification column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge

coli, or to try a direct transformation of highly competent Bacillus strain.Here, we aimed to produce a cocktail of five antifungal peptides whose production in Bacillus subtilis will be triggered by presence of fungi.The whole antifungal operon was too big to be synthesized by IDT as one gblock.).At this step, we can only hypothesize that our system is leaking sufficient expression of the toxins for them to be lethal, either in E. coli or in B. subtilis.Again, we can only speculate about the toxicity of the toxin.To validate the theophylline riboswitch, we inferred that we should obtain clones of Bacillus subtilis transformed with the pSBBS0K-Mini \u0096Epsilon/MazF only in presence of theophylline: the molecule should prevent the expression of the MazF toxin that is lethal since the antitoxin MazE is not present.However, we did not manage to obtain the whole assembly (figure 2), neither partial ones, in spite of about 20 attempts\u0085The SDP operon is smaller than the SKF one and it was possible to obtain the optimized sequences as two gblocks.Figure 11: Result of the Bacillus subtilis transformation with pSBBS0K-Mini \u0096Epsilon/MazF (we know this is not the most illustrative figure ever!They were subsequently cloned in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobricks BBA_K1937004 and BBa_K1937006.We tested the expression and specificity of the RFP driven by pNagA and pNagP when growing in presence of glucose or NAG (figure 7).However, we did not manage to obtain the second operon in the pSB1C3 (encoding Dermaseptin B1, GAFP-1 and entire Metchnikowin antifungal peptides).The predation system is based on the production of toxins by B. subtilis, and these toxins were reported to be harmful to E. coli (Nandy et al., 2007, FEBS Letters.The fungi were then inoculated on each spot whereas our therapeutic agent only on Spot 8.Figure 9: Test on the rock inoculated with Talaromyces funiculosum at T=0 (on the left) and T=3 weeks post infection (on the right).After 3 weeks, the growth of fungi was clearly visible on spots 1 to 6, with the most efficient growth on the spot 3 which had the following medium composition:Interestingly, no growth of the fungus was observed on spots 7 and 8.The AF_A operon was subsequently cloned in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobrick BBA_K1937008.Figure 5: Layout of antifungal operons and their assembly.In order to express specifically the antifungal peptides in close vicinity to fungi, we choose the two N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG) inducible promotors pNagA and pNagP.In conclusion, pNagA and pNagP appear as able to promote expression in response to NAG, even if the growth conditions could be improved to get higher and more homogeneous expression levels.Figure 7: NAG-driven expression of RFP.The first step was therefore to be able to grow fungi on rocks.In order to do so, we have deposed on the surface of the rocks growth media with various nutriment compositions (see Table 1).However, the ability to get the fungi grown on rock was already a good result, indicating that we might have a good model to test our bacteria.Red spots appeared only with pNagA or pNagP on NAG (close-ups on part 7B).We found out that the best culture conditions for the fungi that permits a slight growth of Bacillus were with \u00bc PDA and 2% glucose.We observed that the reaction seems to be effective with the presence of a new band corresponding to the combined size of the two gblocks (figure 4).The Epsilon/MazF construction was rapidly sub-cloned in the pSB1C3 backbone (new composite part BBa_K1937009), and then in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobricks BBa_K1937010 (figure 10).We tested the predation of B. subtilis Wild Type (strain 168) against Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain SBW25), a deleterious strain present in the cave.Briefly, the protocol consists in growing both strains in rich medium, mixing them in PBS and monitoring their growth (figure 1).To get rid of restriction sites that could interfere with the cloning steps, we ordered the optimized sequences from IDT as four gblocks.In both cases, the properties will have to be optimized, through a higher and more homogeneous expression from the NAG-driven promoters and through the completion of the antifungal operons to produce more than two antifungal peptides.We were able to set up a model which mimics the cave s environment.Our aim is to reinforce the natural predation capacity of B. subtilis and to ensure it is expressed independantly of the conditions.An explanation to our problems could be that SDP and SKF cloning in E. coli results in the bacterium death.The late expression could mean that the formulation of our minimal medium is not optimal.The fact that the pNagA-RFP and pNagP-RFP strains seem able to slightly express the RFP on glucose (figure 7B, left panel close-up), albeit on weaker extend that on NAG (figure 7B, right panel close-up), could be due to the alleviating of the catabolic repression.The constructions with the RFP reporter gene were ordered from IDT and successfully sub-cloned in the pSB1C3 (new parts BBa_K1937003 and BBa_K1937005 ; figure 6).We tested different fungi (Aspergillus niger, Talaromyces funiculosus and Chaetomium globosum) but we eventually focussed on Talaromyces funiculosus that seems easier to manipulate to us.Our test consisted in adding, on fungi inoculated plates, paper patches soaked with either copper sulfate (positive control), LB medium (negative control), a suspension of Bacillus subtilis WT or Bacillus subtilis expressing the antifungal AF_A operon (figure 8).These observations allow us to conclude that AF_A is functional.As our therapeutic bacterium was supposed to treat fungi growing on the walls of a cave, we needed to test its activity in conditions that would mimic the cave\u0092s environment.However, we never managed to get the MazE/Zeta construction in the pSB1C3 backbone.We had thought about this problem, but we had believed the expression driven by the pVeg Bacillus promoter to be insufficient for such effect.From there, our strategy was to do Gibson cloning to obtain the full operon in pSB1C3 in E. coli and then to transfer it in B. subtilis.We hypothesize that one of the peptide could be toxic for E. coli.Thanks to it, we got encouraging results showing that the therapeutic agent might be functional.Here, we fashioned a genetic system to prevent horizontal transfer of our synthetic constructions.As the later one contained our therapeutic agent, this observation suggested that our modified bacterium might be active against the fungi.The red color of the spots was due to ochre, whose purpose was to mimic the frescoes of the cave (See Figure below).Sub-cloning of the first operon (containing cut version of the Metchnikowin and D4E1) on the pSB1C3 backbone was rapidly performed, leading to the new composite part BBa_K1937007 (pSB1C3-AF_A).The sequence were optimized for the Bacillus codon usage and to remove inadequate restriction sites.However, the absence of growth on Spot 7 would argue against this conclusion.", "safety": "This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.We have to apply the basic safety principles in all laboratory rooms:- It is forbidden to drink and eat in the laboratory rooms.- It is compulsory to wear a closed lab coat in cotton.- Oral pipetting of any substance is prohibited in any laboratory.There are also others precautions when working with biological organisms:- It is compulsory to wear gloves except for the use of an electric burner.- In some cases (UV light, projection risk), it is compulsory to wear protection glasses.- Equipments: As soon as we manipulate in the lab, we have to wear the following personal protective equipments (a conventional lab coat, closed with long sleeves, closed shoes, gloves, glasses if needed).A specific trash can is dedicated to gloves or paper and another is dedicated to the agarose gels that were contaminated.- Chemical hood: We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals (for example: the usage of alcohol

for engineers (INSA Toulouse), thus we have to respect the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms.Abstract: In the lab, we have to respect numerous safety regulations for the security and health of others and the environment.As we work with microorganisms and cell cultures, we are concerned by the regulation on workers\u0092 protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No.First of all, we have designed a physical device that would confine our engineered bacteria to the area to be treated (see the device part).However, when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the public and the environment.We have used E. coli and B. subtilis chassis, since their genomes are very well characterized and, of course, since these bacteria are non-pathogenic.Moreover, the French regulation does not allow any genetically modified microorganisms to be taken outside the lab.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)No.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)No.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly

release our bacteria in the environment without being confident enough that there won\u0092t be any disturbances of the ecosystems of the Lascaux caves and the surrounding environment.That\u0092s why, to minimize both the risk of dissemination and of gene transfer, several solutions were planned.Thanks to her, we have completed a formation (with the NEO software) to learn the different risks related to our work in the laboratory and how to react in case of danger.We have to obey to the rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (Decree No.- Waste: Different trash containers are available in the lab:- One for biological waste.This room is key-closed and the wearing of a lab coat, gloves and glasses is mandatory.At the end, we had a test to make sure that we comprehended everything.--> Autoclave training: Our team has taken an autoclave training, which showed us the explosive and implosive dangers of the dispositive and the security measures to take in order to protect oneself.- Biological safety cabinet: To work into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms, we have used a biological safety cabinet (FASTER \u0096 Ultrasafe).Their goal is to ensure the well-being of the employees, regarding safety rules and risk prevention.A lab coat, heat resistant gloves and glasses were required for the manipulation of the autoclave.During summer, our team worked in the engineering school INSA, which has a safety department.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5).Therefore, the main threat is the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where gene transfer could occur between microorganisms.In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures.This Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be followed in research laboratories, where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens.The last control was executed on October 25th 2015.A control of maintenance is done each year.These organisms do

grown in a co-culture in BG-11 with 5g/l of acetate.As can be seen in Figure 5, the acetate production alone in JA06 is not enough to sustain a stable growth of Y. lipolytica, but can rather only keep a few cells alive.The JA06 strain showed acetate levels of up to 0.22 g/l when grown in regular BG-11, Figure 2, and up to 0.74 g/l when grown in BG-11 with bicarbonate, Figure 3.Fig 2.OD730 and acetate over time for Synechocystis JA06 in BG-11Fig 3.OD730 and acetate over time for Synechocystis JA06 in BG-11 + NaHCO3Although the JA06 strain already showed some promising numbers for acetate production it was believed that this number could have been increased further with the genetic modifications that were planned for the organism.Although the promoter study was completed, the continued work on S. cerevisiae was put on hold for other tasks that at the time were deemed more important.A growth trial was performed on both the WT and JA06 strains of Synechocystis given to us to study its growth rate, Figure 1, and the acetate production, Figure 2 & Figure 3.This is good since it indicates that the added features of the mutant strain does not put any major metabolic burden on the organism.Fig 1.OD730 over time for Synechocystis wild type and JA06 in BG-11When measuring the samples from the growth trial by using HPLC it was shown that the wild type had no acetate production, as was expected.With some of the modifications that were planned for the organisms it is possible that the acetate production would\u0092ve been enough for a stable growth.None of the planned modifications were however successfully performed as there were major problems with the assembly and transformation of constructs during the project.A growth trial was performed to investigate the ability of the different organisms to naturally grow on acetate in BG-11 media.This was expected based on the growth trials of Y. lipolytica and JA06.Two initial co-cultures were tested using the unmodified JA06 strain of Synechocystis and the WT of Y. lipolytica.As can be seen in Figure 1 the wild type and mutant strain JA06 of Synechocystis followed a very similar growth curve during the 600 hours long growth trial.The organism that was most successfully grown under the desired conditions was Y. lipolytica, Figure 4.Y. lipolytica has been shown to grow on sucrose after adding a gene for sucrose utilization [2].Secondly, for Synechosystis it might be easier and quicker to knock down the expression of targeted genes than knocking them out, since the multiple copies of chromosomes in Synechosystis makes knocking genes out a labor intensive and slow process [3].But with all the issues that were encountered with the construct assemblies and transformations there was not time to get them working.Fig 4.Yarrowia\u0092s OD over time when grown in BG-11 media with 5 g/l acetate.Y.It was thus not possible to carry out many of the desired modifications in the time frame dedicated for the lab work.Which constructs were successfully assembled can be seen in Table 1.Table 1.These were supposed to enable the production organisms for the dependency system of the co-culture and to increase the acetate production of Synechocystis.In one of the co-cultures standard BG-11 media was used, Figure 5, and in the other BG-11 with 5 g/l of acetate was used, Figure 6.It is however positive to see that the co-culture with added acetate seems to show that both organisms can be sustained in a single culture without causing any obvious problems for the other\u0092s survival.It is worth noting that the cell density differs by a lot from day to day.There were many planned modifications for each of the 5 organisms that were going to be used.Cell density (x 106) over time for Y. lipolytica and Synechocystis JA06 when grown in a co-culture in BG-11.6.Considering that the current highest obtained concentration of acetate was 0.74 g/l a stable co-culture between the two organisms is not quite possible yet.", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "In the case of our cyanobacterium, the limiting substrate in the model is the amino acid produced by the production organism (arginine for E. coli and B. subtilis, and glutamine for S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica), for which Synechocystis is auxotrophic.For that reason, we have only looked at parameters for Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica, the latter being the production organism to have shown the most promise in the lab.Making a parameter estimation for the maximum growth rate was not very difficult for either organism, as we had data from our growth trials.Unfortunately, we ended up not having time to incorporate this last part in the project, but we\u0092d like to direct a big \u0093thank you\u0094 their way for all their help!With this basic model we can study the ratio between Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica that stabilises over time, as can be seen in figure 1.Therefore, after a predictive model is reached, the problem of getting Synechocystis to produce enough acetate for a production organism in co-culture will almost certainly remain a difficult challenge, and one that has to be surmounted when going forward with this project.For this model we have assumed that we will be able to maintain conditions where the amino acid will be the growth-limiting factor.For a substrate-constrained system governed by Monod kinetics, growth can be described with the following equations [1].For the production organism, this is quite realistic, as the only substrate available will be the acetate produced by Synechocystis.The ratio between Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica stabilises over time.Even if the ratio our model returned is not to be taken too seriously, it is not unrealistic that the cyanobacterium should outnumber the production organism, given the premises of the model.Lacking enough time in the lab for this, however, we have elected to make some rough estimations of what these parameters might be, in order to be able to show the model at work.Naturally, this might not be a good approximation, but as we need measurements of our own to get the model to be predictive anyway, this just serves as a first step to see the model in action.At this stage we collaborated with the Manchester iGEM team in order to get help with parameter estimations.Just like in the article, we have not taken cell death into account in this first simple system.The first two rows of equations describe regular substrate-constrained Monod-governed growth, where \u00b5 is the growth rate [1/h], n is the cell density [g DW/L], k is the maximum growth rate [1/h], K is the substrate affinity [mol/L], and c is the concentration of cross-fed metabolite [mol/L].Glutamine requirement for Synechocystis proved harder to find a source for, so we did some back-of-the-envelope calculations based on the approximate percentage of cell dry weight that is proteins, and the percentage of amino acid residues in proteins that is glutamine.Here, ? represents the export rate of a nutrient [mol/(g DW*h)] in the organism that produces it.In a coculture where the organisms are dependent on each other for survival, a mathematical model can be useful to predict the stability of the system under different conditions.The closest thing we could find on arginine export rates in Y. lipolytica was the same information for C. glutamicum [4].While this amino acid is required by the cyanobacterium, it is not guaranteed to always be rate limiting.[5]\u00a0\u00a0 Labarre J, Thuriaux P, Chauvat F. Genetic analysis of amino acid transport in the facultatively heterotrophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.Since no measurements seem to be available for either of the organisms and their limiting substrates, we decided to use the Michaelis-Menten constants for uptake of the relevant substrates as approximations.[1].Our model relies on the assumption that the system is substrate-constrained.Another conceivable limitation is the CO2 used by Synechocystis during photosynthesis, but that should be relatively simple to maintain abundant levels of.? is the required amount of the same nutrient for growth, for the organism that is limited by its availability [mol/g DW].We used MATLAB to solve the differential equations above for two organisms simultaneously, with a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver.Naturally, this provides only a rough estimate.As we got our Synechocystis strain from Josefine Anfelt in Paul Hudson\u0092s group at KTH, information on its acetate export rate was readily available in one of their articles [3].The amount of acetate exported by the cyanobacterium is not very high.Parameter estimations for Synechocystis and Y. lipolyticaFor substrate requirement, we found the biomass yield on acetate for Y. lipolytica [2] and inverted it.The ideal solution would be to perform experiments ourselves to measure export rates and growth requirements of the essential nutrients, as well as substrate affinities.We could only find the desired constant for Synechocystis [5], so we used that value for Y. lipolytica as well.1987;169(10):4668-73.2015;33(10):1061.2004;279(10):9125-38.In the last equation, we look at the change in the extracellular concentration of the respective limiting nutrients.The remaining parameters proved more difficult, since there are of course no papers published on the effects of changes we have made ourselves during the project.While the coding itself did not present any problems, finding the correct values for all parameters turned out to be trickier.", "notebook": "Check out all the protocols we used in the project.Check out how we made lab work easier to follow

1 the wild type and mutant strain JA06 of Synechocystis followed a very similar growth curve during the 600 hours long growth trial.The organism that was most successfully grown under the desired conditions was Y. lipolytica, Figure 4.Y. lipolytica has been shown to grow on sucrose after adding a gene for sucrose utilization [2].Secondly, for Synechosystis it might be easier and quicker to knock down the expression of targeted genes than knocking them out, since the multiple copies of chromosomes in Synechosystis makes knocking genes out a labor intensive and slow process [3].But with all the issues that were encountered with the construct assemblies and transformations there was not time to get them working.Fig 4.Yarrowia\u0092s OD over time when grown in BG-11 media with 5 g/l acetate.Y.It was thus not possible to carry out many of the desired modifications in the time frame dedicated for the lab work.Which constructs were successfully assembled can be seen in Table 1.Table 1.These were supposed to enable the production organisms for the dependency system of the co-culture and to increase the acetate production of Synechocystis.In one of the co-cultures standard BG-11 media was used, Figure 5, and in the other BG-11 with 5 g/l of acetate was used, Figure 6.It is however positive to see that the co-culture with added acetate seems to show that both organisms can be sustained in a single culture without causing any obvious problems for the other\u0092s survival.It is worth noting that the cell density differs by a lot from day to day.There were many planned modifications for each of the 5 organisms that were going to be used.Cell density (x 106) over time for Y. lipolytica and Synechocystis JA06 when grown in a co-culture in BG-11.6.Considering that the

fragment in the first digest, or the small EcoRI-XbaI fragment in the 2nd digest).In both cases, empty vector is generated with EcoRI and PstI overhangs.Your computer must have some Java package already installed in order to use the program.Using the DNA designed above and ordered from our gracious sponsor, Integrated DNA Technologies, we proceeded to clone the three HZS genes into the standard BioBrick vector, pSB1C3, through routine restriction enzyme digestion and ligation.Our strategy for this initial step and subsequent cloning steps was to take advantage of the standard BioBrick restriction sites, EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI.In summary, this strategy uses a triple digest and takes advantage of the fact that most commercial spin columns do not capture small fragments like the EcoRI-XbaI fragment, which would have interfered with the ligation if not removed (however, gel purification is not necessary here).We also developed a strategy to use Gibson Assembly, both to clone individual HZS subunits fused to a reporter gene and to generate a three-protein operon that will produce the entire protein.Furthermore, the program will eliminate any of the standard

doubling of waste entering NZ\u0092s landfills within ten years), the NZ councils have enacted a zero-waste policy; to progressively achieve zero-waste status by 2040.Our team\u0092s aim was to aid this policy (as well as the global plastic plague) by producing a strain of E. coli that produces enzymes which degrade PET.The bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis uses two enzymes to break PET down into Terephthatlic Acid (TPA) and Ethylene Glycol (EG): PETase and MHETase respectively (Yoshida et al., 2016).An initial introductory skype session allowed us to meet, give one another a run down on our respective projects, and to figure out how we might be able to assist each other.We found that the best way the UoA iGEM team could help the Sydney team would be to liaise with large New Zealand horticulture companies on their behalf.Members of iGEM UoA were also able to fill out a survey provided by the iGEM Sydney, and distribute this survey to other people in order to assist them in their data collection.To help us at iGEM UoA, the team at the University of Sydney provided their laboratory protocols for His-Tag purification and IPTG Induction.The NTCU Formosa team kindly presented their work to us, as well as sharing details of their past iGEM projects and meet-ups, to give us more of an idea how the iGEM competition works.Doi: 10.1126/science.aad6359As a student-led start-up team we decided to approach the Taiwanese teams NTCU and NYMU, who had gone through multiple rounds of iGEM competitions in the past years, to receive some tips and tricks of the competition process and team system development.Both teams in Taiwan are working on pesticides that are targeted to a specific agricultural epidemic that has caused great loss in Taiwanese farmlands.This is discovery will assist with both teams sustainability in iGEM competition in the future to come.In true ANZAC spirit, iGEM UoA collaborated with the iGEM team from the University of Sydney.This was done, and a relationship was established with Turner\u0092s and Grower\u0092s NZ who were able to provide the team from Sydney with valuable information regarding the influence of fruit ripening on the produce storage and transportation industry.We exchanged with them our experience as a start-up team on what challenge we faced just to get the team together as we are all interested to know what would be the different kind of administrative barriers from a team that have a developed system and a newly set-up.The team leaders showed us around their lab area and kindly shared their detailed and well planned perspective on their human practice project which most definitely broaden our horizon as a start-up team on how extensively an iGEM can affect and influence the community.The first, a functional domain, has the ability to cleave polyethylene terephthalanie, the main plastic used in bottles world-wide, into a monomer ethylene terephthalate.Plastic is lightweight and has space-filling properties, which allow it to fill 20% of NZ\u0092s landfill space (252,000 tonnes per year), with difficult to degrade plastics such as PET contributing to up to 15% of this.In 2015, 56 million tonnes of plastic was produced worldwide; although some of this is recycled or the energy from the plastic is utilized, much of it enters landfills.Given time, effort, and perhaps a little luck, we could purify and find the 3D structure of these PET degrading enzymes, which would allow us to characterise them, and potentially refine and improve the mechanism of PET degradation for commercial use.Our part encodes for a protein derived from Idonella sakaiensis first discovered by Yoshida et al.It is here that we took inspiration for our project; to create biobricks for PETase and MHETase that, when inserted into an E. coli vector, could produce viable, purifiable proteins, that are secreted from the cell, or can be obtained through lysing the E. coli..These teams emphasised raising awareness for the implementation of safe biotechnology into daily use, to elevate the quality of human lives , and the environment.They elaborated on their human practise projects, which included working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture in Taiwan, and showed their dedication on making the agriculture sector a more biotech/engineering- friendly place.We concluded that the main difference would be the focus that shifted from the system development of the sub-teams and relationship building with the University to inter-team communication and interaction within team members.The third and final domain is a polyhistadine domain allowing for easy purification of the protein by affinity chromatography.This part was expressed using the T7 promoter (part BBa_1719005) under the control of the lac operator sequence (unpublished).Yoshida S et al.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We were able to create an effective dialogue with students, with some even asking if a

of the students and we highly appreciated there passion and thinking.\u0093It was a wonderful and engaging presentation.Furthermore, interactive-based activities were held to introduce synthetic biology, to discuss the positive and negative implications, and to clarify any misconceptions about both the field and the use of GMOs.Coupled with this, we hope that more New Zealand teams are prompted to participate in future competitions and to promote the synthetic biology field even further.The students all had positive responses to the presentation.Public education programs functioning

"description": "", "design": "The HMS will be prototyped extensively to develop a more efficient design, and its mobile app will continue to be streamlined.The fishBIT system combines the simplicity of standard fish tags with the novelty of a synthetic biology treatment.The plastic harpoon region was designed to ensure that the tag remains in its host under most forces.Overall fishBIT was able to handle both conditions very well - the clamp stayed in place, and the tag did not twist in a manner that would impeded the natural movements of the fish.To address these goals, fishPHARM has developed engineering solutions for the individualized delivery of flavocide, our bioengineered peptide treatment for BCWD, as well as a fish farm tank monitoring system for the constant monitoring of aquaculture conditions.Tugging gently on fish tags after applying them is standard procedure for tagging fish, and is a good test for the tenacity of the newly placed tag [1].One of the improvements that drylab is considering for the future is using a smaller clamp on our fish tag in order to have the tag maintain smooth movements in turbulent waters.Stress testing - We plan on using a stress machine to apply loads to the fishBIT barb, head/tubing interface, and clamp/tubing interface, in order to find maximum load capabilities.Testing of the fishBIT system in a hydraulic flow channel has shown that fishBIT can resist normal fish motion and speeds.FishPHARM presents the Heimdall Monitoring System (HMS).The main purpose of hydrodynamics testing was to see how well water at high speeds is able to flow over the fish tag.Thus, an orange was used in place of salmon tissue because the purpose of the testing was mainly to observe the flow of water over the part of the tag that is exposed outside the fish\u0092s body.This system would make treating fish a much less time-consuming process, and would increase the appeal of the fishPHARM BCWD treatment method.Based on our testing on the agar block, we expected fishBIT to not be as effective as the standard tag.FishBIT is safe for the fish, and is constructed using materials which are all approved by the FDA.Additionally, our fish tag was able to successfully remain inside the agar (more testing about the effect of water flow on fish tag embedding is discussed in the \u0093Hydrodynamics\u0094 section).However, as seen by the effect on the agar, both our applicator and tag should be made narrower in order to inflict less trauma on the fish tissue.Industry standards for salmon were used to develop the size and shape of the fish tag [2].Inspired by fish tags, devices used to track fish in the wild, fishBIT allows fish farmers to target specific fish for flavocide treatment.fishPHARM\u0092s mechanical engineering work centers around two main principles: 1) the real-world implementation of a peptide treatment for bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), and 2) the prevention of bacterial coldwater disease outbreaks on fish farms.Each delivery device can store enough flavocide to treat one fish for the prescribed dosing period, as well as be easily re-dosed, making it an effective means of treating multiple and recurring infections.Thus testing fishBIT at 1 m/s is indicative of the conditions that salmon using fishBIT will be living in.The fish tags and applicators, along with the peptide hydrogel, was packaged into a starter kit for distribution to fish farmers.However, our applicator was just as effective as the control applicator in penetrating the scales of the fish, and did not cause significantly more damage to the fish tissue.These factors are important in the health of a fish hatchery, and if improperly maintained, will lead to infections and higher mortality rates.Alternatively, a simpler test would be to attach weights to the fishBIT.This would also provide a reasonable estimate of the tensile strength.Animal and environmental safety guided the fishBIT and flavocide hydrogel design and development.A tube with an inner diameter of 1/16\" and outer diameter of 1/8\" was attached to the back of the fish tag to hold the hydrogel.A first prototype of the hardware is in the process of being built, and the mobile app is ready for testing.Future work will be done at fishPHARM to improve the design and manufacturing of fishBIT for mass production.The conclusions of our ballistics testing are also supported by the feedback from the Rome and Bath fish hatcheries.This would allow the estimation of the tensile strength of fishBIT, and to readjust the design or incorporate more durable materials if necessary.Named after the Norse god of surveillance, the HMS consists of sensor hardware to be installed within aquaculture tanks, as well as a mobile app for the continuous monitoring and collection of temperature, flow rate, dissolved oxygen concentration, and nitrate concentration.We tested fishBIT at the maximum speed of the Tilting Wind-Water Tunnel, which is approximately 1 m/s.The orange near the surface of the water represented turbulent water conditions that fishBIT would have to withstand, and the orange submerged approximately 10 cm under the surface of the water represented faster flowing water conditions.fishPHARM presents fishBIT, a novel means of delivering time-released flavocide gel to each fish individually.The control tag and the fishBIT tag both resisted a gentle tug on the exposed portion.FishBIT and the standard tags were applied with their respective applicators.We have simulated in the lab our fishBIT prototype working under the real world conditions that the device will encounter in an aquatic ecosystem.Furthermore, both the protein and the gel are both environmentally safe; the peptide is ubiquitous and the gel degrades easily.Our tag applicator was designed to be used just like conventional applicators, but with added comfort and easier handling.fishPHARM is currently working on an alternative, more efficient applicator that is inspired by firearm trigger mechanisms.Each fishBIT starter kits comes with 20 fishBIT tags, a tag applicator, a vial containing our novel flavocide, a needle, a syringe, and an information booklet.FDA-approved, biocompatible, and environmentally safe PLGA polymer will used to create the peptide hydrogel [3].FishBIT is a novel solution to drug delivery in fish.Farmers can choose to apply the fishBIT system to a few affected fish, or to their whole farms.We also wanted to make sure our applicator was as effective as the standard applicator in penetrating the skin and scales of salmon.It also serves as a marker to determine how much gel has dissolved.The bright red gel consists of the entericidin protein contained in FDA-approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid).One possible future method of delivering Flavocide would be a pneumatic injection system, which injects individual capsules in fish for rapid and accurate delivery.Additional testing will be conducted as we plan to apply for FDA approval of the device.Therefore, we used a diseased salmon and injected both systems into the tissue.We injected fishBIT and standard fish tags (from fishtagger.com) into a 1% concentration clear agar block to qualitatively assess damage done to fish tissue.A syringe was used to insert the hydrogel into the tube, and a clamp was placed at the end to prevent hydrogel escape.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "Figure 1: The initial setup of the Part 2 model, showing the concentration of EcnB within the fish tag.Because the biodegradable hydrogel used to carry our EcnB peptide has several tunable properties including rate of biodegradation and internal concentration of EcnB, we decided to model the distribution of the peptide throughout the fish in order to better understand what properties we want in the gel.More and more peptide is released but, due to the small opening, there is a limit on how fast the peptide can diffuse out of the tag.To get at least an approximate target EcnB concentration, the Part 1 model should be adjusted and simplified.The gel has only degraded a short way through, but there is enough peptide to maintain a high flux into the fish.Figure 3: The Part 2 model after a longer time has passed.The degraded gel face has moved farther back, but the peptide concentration remains high throughout the entire tag.As can be seen in figures 2 and 3, the fish tag can maintain a high outflow concentration that approaches the initial gel concentration.We simulated hydrogel diffusion through the fish to determine the resultant concentration of EcnB peptide within a fish, assuming that all of the EcnB peptide within the gel is transferred into the subcutaneous layer of the fish.We decided to continue with the second part of the model, but using representative parameter values rather than experimental.The purpose of this second model was to find our ideal hydrogel degradation rate and peptide concentration for proper treatment of BCWD.The peptide exists only within the gel to start with.Figure 2: The Part 2 model after some time has passed.We decided on a 3D model for this part because the fish tag has some odd geometries and isn\u0092t actually symmetric.The target concentration of EcnB on the skin was bounded by the minimum effective concentration against Flavobacterium and the toxic concentration of EcnB in the fish.We found a target EcnB concentration in the blood for a predefined concentration range on the skin by adjusting initial concentration parameters of the bloodstream.The opening of the tag was modelled as an open boundary, meaning the fish is large enough that concentrations of the peptide within the fish is negligible.Both parts were designed using COMSOL Multiphysics.Knowing the EcnB concentration necessary to combat Flavobacterium alone, we worked backwards to determine an effective EcnB concentration in the salmon bloodstream.This model was divided into the drug\u0092s two main components, the EcnB and the hydrogel.We modelled the convection, diffusion, and degradation of the peptide through blood vessels, muscle tissue, and the skin of an idealized 2D fish.Because our 2D model hadn\u0092t provided reasonable answers to formulate a target outward flux from the tag, we decided to make a representative model instead.We used SolidWorks to build the hollow of the fish tag into which we would fill the gel.", "notebook": "In addition, we researched specific tubing, clamps and other materials that we intend to utilize for the fish tag Policy and Practices We

them.That same week, both hatcheries and the field station were able to give us valuable critiques including their opinion on the size of our product, the ease of application, and even encouraged us to continue with what they believed to be a valuable contribution to improvement of the fish industry.Drylab Dry lab continued with the design of labels and business cards.Policy and Practices We sent our prototype of the fishBit to Rome Fish Hatchery and the Cornell Biological Field Station for feedback.Policy and Practices We continued the topic of DNA in bacteria with the YOURS kids by talking about antibiotic resistance and how we only want certain genes in our own experiments.Members conducted research into various aspects of the aquaculture industry, consumer behavior, and finances in order to construct a comprehensive business plan.He talked to us about the fish they raise, the types of diseases the fish face such as ferunculosis, and the overall day-to-day things the hatchery has to worry about like maintenance.Wetlab We cultured, ligated, and plated some of the new plasmids (A(LMNJKR) +H).We learned that the hatchery has chosen not to use fish tags and instead clips fish fins to keep track.There were some weird results on gels of other constructs, possibly due to mutations in the backbone (H).Flavobacterium growth was tested on different types of plates to see if our plates were the issue causing lack of growth.Drylab Business plan was reviewed by a professor with expertise in the area.Drylab Members designed potential business cards along with labels for the flavocide gel vials.Drylab Dry lab continued with construction of the box.We also received synthesized plasmids from DNA 2.0 with all EcnB inserts from biobricked Z constructs and MBP-TEV (not in pSB1C3).Sensor design for the app was started.Sweet\u0092s opinion of the future for the fish/agriculture industry was that the environment would put greater stresses on wild fish and therefore depending on farm-raised fish would be beneficial in supplying the demand for more food in a world with a rising population.We had some issues with low DNA concentrations after gel purifications, so we increased amount of DNA used in digestions.The flavo subteam made cultures of two strains of Flavobacterium, and measured growth of bacteria with spectrophotometer.We also did a fun experiment with

glycerol stock along ZK, ZO, ZA, and ZB.Drylab Dry lab tested the durability of fishBIT using agar gel samples and dead fish samples.We re-plated Flavobacterium on new plates(both strains).Dry lab came up with the design of a box that can be used to market our products.In addition, we began researching sensors that could potentially complement the app.We successfully sequenced and glycerol stocked ZR, ZL, and ZJ constructs.We contacted Bath hatchery and set up a meeting time in July so that we could drive there and talk to representatives in person and our project in perspective of current solutions.SILS is a program of the Office of Undergraduate Biology (OUB) at Cornell that invited undergraduates to present their summer research activities.We hope to use any advice and critiques to update our fishBit to fit the industry\u0092s needs in the best way possible.Policy and Practices iGem members Sachi and Saie presented at the The Summer Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) symposium.Wetlab We had issues with growing cultures for Gibson plates.Wetlab The second set of western blot revealed expression of ZG, MJ, and ZT.Wetlab Had some issues growing cultures on plates.AA+H (ZA) construct and AA+B (ZB) construct were sent for sequencing to verify the contents of the construct.Wetlab EcnB part extracted from A(ABEF) synthesized plasmids and purified.We introduced our mentors to the kids and taught them about DNA and its importance.We were also directed to speak to Andy Norse at Rome Hatchery who was more aware of chemicals used to treat water to prevent diseases, and we followed up with a call on Monday to plan a Skype meeting with Andy.Switched focus to getting expression from all biobricked Z constructs and MJ to use in ZOI assays.Wetlab At this stage, Z(A,B,E,G,J,K,L,O,R) constructs have been biobricked.The kids learned how to pipet and load something into a gel and watched as we showed them how we run gel electrophoresis experiments everyday.They learned about the ubiquitous nature of bacteria when they used cotton swabs to gather different bacterial samples from different areas in the building and let the samples grow overnight.Started using Phusion PCR on all constructs that had not been biobricked (for increased yield).Drylab Dry lab finalized plans for testing fishBIT.We determined that our plates (for the Flavobacterium) were the issue.Wetlab We had to re-culture several plasmids (pre-ligation).Drylab Meeting addressed fundamental parts of a business plan.The YOURS students also learned about how the fish are raised and transported in detail and were allowed to feed the fish.", "protocol": "", "result": "", "safety": "When lifting heavy objects, proper lifting technique was used, and an appropriate number of individuals were used for lifting said objects.Training : All team members who work in the wet lab must complete Cornell EH&S general lab safety and chemical waste disposal courses prior to the onset of work.During this program, safety officers reinforce safety procedures learned during the EH&S courses, discuss safety protocol pertaining to specific chemicals with which we work, and ensure all lab members fully understand all safety procedures.In the case of the wet lab in particular, this involves going through a detailed list of protocols, including all organisms, chemicals, and genetic constructs being worked with, to ensure conformity with the Environmental Health & Safety guidelines.Prior to the onset of work for the year, all new members are required to go through a safety training program.These team members are responsible for discussing the proposed work plan for the project with the wet lab and machine shop managers before starting work to ensure that it is safe to continue.These team members also act as liaisons to the wet lab and machine shop managers and, when necessary, the Institutional Biosafety Committee to ensure proper equipment usage.One team member each was chosen for the wet and dry lab subteams to ensure that all team members are working safely, whether with bacterial cultures or power tools.During these sessions, Dr. Archer familiarizes new members with the safety equipment and procedures specific to the labspace in which we work.They must go through the same safety training as all other team members, but are required to redo the training each time we recruit new members in order to keep up-to-date with safety considerations.While working in the machine shop we maintained a clean work environment so we could maintain visibility at all times.Enforcement: Team members who violate safety rules are required to work under the supervision of the safety officers for the remainder of the week, or until the safety officer believes the member is capable of performing the task unsupervised.Additionally, all team members must complete a lab orientation session with the manager of the BME instructional lab, Dr. Shivaun Archer.Dry Lab: We use the Emerson Machine Shop for fabrication; each of the dry lab subteam members has attended the prescribed training session for use of the shop and has learned to use each of the tools safely.Environmental Safety: If any biological materials escape from the lab there is a risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance from our engineered strains into other organisms.In addition, they maintain contact with the supervisors of the workspaces, usually in the form of a weekly check-in, to discuss any safety concerns that have arisen and ensure that equipment continues to be used properly.Safety Officers: The safety officers were chosen to be team members who could directly supervise the activities of the other team members.Laboratory Safety: Our project involves regular use of ethidium bromide, a DNA-intercalating agent known to cause cancer, as well as the use of powerful UV light, for visualization of gel electrophoresis.We maintain 2 copies of MSDS s for every chemical we use in the lab: one for our own records and one for the lab manager and users of the lab space who are not part of our team.Closed-toe shoes and long pants were also worn when working in the machine shop.Each member of the dry lab subteam was trained in the safe usage of the milling machine and the metal lathe.Wet Lab: All lab members wear nitrile gloves, closed-toe shoes, and use eye protection when working with volatile chemicals or UV light.All machine shop work is conducted under the supervision of the Emerson machine shop staff.For multiple infractions or complete disregard to safety protocols, a member may be restricted from laboratory work until he/she undergoes EHS chemical safety online training again, and demonstrates proper performance to a team leader of failed technique(s) in a controlled setting.All toxic waste is placed in a specialized receptacle and is picked up and disposed of by Cornell Environmental Health and Safety.We also work with ethanol lamps to maintain a sterile environment, which do involve having an open flame on the benchtop.It has been classified as a Biosafety Level 1 organism according to the NIH, and is thus essentially harmless to the human population.All biohazard waste is autoclaved and transported to the building s centralized waste facility where it is disposed of as regulated biological waste.These courses set specific guidelines and are the standard requirement for work in a biosafety-level 1 lab at Cornell.", "keywords": "U n k n o w n", "track": "Environment", "part_favorite": "", "part_normal":

baker\u0092s yeast, Figure 1.In the degradation part of our project, we introduce a gene coding for an enzyme called microcystinase (MlrA) into yeast cells.The first step in the detection of microcystin is to get the toxin inside the yeast cell.We also hope to be able to predict the response of our promoter constructs to different microcystin levels with the help of modeling results.Both the detection and degradation are implemented with the help of modified baker\u0092s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiaeA simplified diagram of the detection mechanism and degradation enzyme production processes in genetically modified yeast.In our engineered yeast, promoter regions of genes involved in oxidative stress response are coupled to genes coding for yellow fluorescent protein.We hope that the level of fluorescence will correspond to the extent of oxidative stress, and therefore also the concentration of microcystin.We will have three variants of the enzyme to optimize its expression in yeast cells.This increases the activity of certain transcription factors, which activate genes involved in the oxidative stress response (He and Fassler, 2005).Consequently, when encountering microcystin, our yeast will start to produce yellow fluorescent protein, and the resulting fluorescence can then be measured.Check out our introduction video \u0093Matti and the cyanobacteria\u0094 to see how our solution for this problem would work!Normal yeast lab strains are not known to be capable of doing this, but there is one strain, normally used in winemaking, which is capable of importing microcystins.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We had a many meetings right in the beginning of our project just to hear from different experts what they consider to be synthetic biology, what they thought of our various ideas and how they would proceed with the project.Addressing a local problem creates an affinity between our project and the public, and also makes it easier for us to promote synthetic biology to them.We wanted to see what kind of need there was for informing the general public about all the possibilities synthetic biology offers, as well as, from our project\u0092s point of view, the need to inform about the dangers of cyanobacteria.These experts gave us much appreciated information and new perspectives to our ideas When our team started brainstorming for the project idea, our general knowledge of what would be feasible and what wouldn\u0092t was quite insufficient.They have also helped us during the course of our project - for example the degradation part of our project would not have ended up being what it is without their help.The University of Helsinki\u0092s Faculty of Science wrote an article about our project and especially what the two mathematicians of our team had learned from this synthetic biology project.They guided us to the Finnish Environment Institute (Suomen ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6keskus, SYKE), where we got to discuss the cyanobacteria problem and our project with experts.In the beginning, we didn\u0092t really understand how scary and strange a branch synthetic biology seems to be for people not involved in it, but during the project we started to understand this.When we met with companies, there was also a lot of discussion of the potential commercialization of our project, which meant patenting our idea.We didn\u0092t change much in our project topic itself based on the interviews but we increased the importance of talking to the public.Although neither the topic of our project nor the nature of iGEM made patenting seem like a relevant concern, we nevertheless thought it would be useful to gain an understanding of this aspect.After that we were able to also think about the modelling part of our project and how it could support the experimental parts of our work.We have written about the meetups on the We have created a website in addition to the Wiki which includes team descriptions, as well as a brief introduction to our project and partners.Our detection device would contain live yeast cells to produce the fluorescence signal, and is the main concern of our project when thinking about accidental release of GMOs.One result of our efforts to communicate with the non-scientific community was our project introduction video \u0093Matti and the cyanobacteria\u0094, found on our We participated in two iGEM meetups, the ones in Stockholm and Paris, which gave us many things to consider in our project.As a part of the recruiting the next year\u0092s team, we will present our project in a few different events, such as the Water Day of the Aalto Unviersity School of Engineering, where different projects related to the water industry are presented, and the Career Day of Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences of the University of Helsinki.We also talked about the possibility to use genetically modified yeast as a sensor in the natural environment and it was nice to hear that they didn\u0092t turn this idea down even if it is not allowed by the Finnish legislation at the moment.how to explain that cyanobacteria are a problem for people who don\u0092t live in Finland and don t have the same problems with it as we do.We talked with ThermoFisher, Algol and LAL (Luonnontieteiden akateemisten liitto), and they showed great interest in our project, even helping us with the funding.Keeping this in mind and inspired by the Finnish nature and lifestyle, we decided to approach the problem of blue-green algae in the context of sauna water, thus limiting the scope of our products to a few drops of water and to maximum one bucket of water (~20 L) for the detection and degradation, respectively.That\u0092s why meeting Merja Oja, who works with modeling biological systems, was very important in the beginning of our project.Still, as each of the interviewed people had encountered blue-green algae, it means that our project can touch their lives and possibly to facilitate their life in the future.We will be presenting our project results and achievements from the Jamboree to some of our sponsors, as well as school representatives.They gave us valuable input on our thoughts of harnessing the yeast stress response Finnish legislation towards genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is strict, similar to the rest of the European Union.As the information has had a significant effect on the design of our project, it will be presented more deeply in integrated human practices section.Some of the most important modifications we did in our presentations to people with limited biological background was dismissing almost all scientific terms, assuming no background information, focusing on what we can achieve with our project instead of the exact methodology, and leaving more time for questions.The most valuable information from our meeting with SYKE, the Finnish Environment Institute, was that we learned what kind of solutions already exist for the blue green algae problem.Even though our team had students from fields ranging from biotechnology to mathematics, there wasn\u0092t anyone who really understood both fields well enough to have a clear idea of what modelling is like in the field synthetic biology.As we didn\u0092t have much experience on protein production in yeast and as it was in a focal role in our project, we needed some help in planning our enzyme constructs.Putting a lot of thought into justifications for our choices at this point of our project turned out to be very useful, since after that, we didn\u0092t have to regret that we should have done something in a completely different way.In Stockholm, the SDU team couldn\u0092t present their full project because they were in the process of patenting it.They also discussed with us the business aspects of our project and gave us good advice on how to build our business strategy if we are to bring our algae detection and degradation methods to masses.Later in the project, we had a meeting with Algol, one of sponsors, where we presented our results.When we had decided on the top three project ideas, we met with researchers working with these different subjects as a part of the background research we did about the different options.We told them about our project, discussed synthetic biology and the use of biotechnology in Finland.This would also let our project be more approachable and understandable to the the public as well as sponsors.If the Cyanobacteria group and professor Frey along with his group affected the degradation aspect of our project the most, Jussi J\u00e4ntti and his research group from VTT likely contributed the most to the detection part.Especially talking with our primary PI Markus Linder directed our brainstorming and ideation, which finally led up to the final design of the project.From interviewing people in the streets, we learned that public knowledge about synthetic biology was rather restricted.In addition, as the synthetic amino acid couldn\u0092t be scavenged from the environment, the GMOs would survive only as long as they are externally supplemented by the amino acids.Besides gaining information about the need of synthetic biology outreach, we wanted to see what people know about blue green algae and if it has caused problems for them.Thanks to input from Kaarina Sivonen and her group, the decision about our project subject was finalized.Our team gave them a presentation about our project and synthetic biology.Also, Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering posted an article about our project, iGEM, and synthetic biology.Each of our team members has also presented themselves, so if you want to get to know our team a bit better, check out the blog: Even though Wiki Freeze and the Giant Jamboree are here, we have still some human practices left after all this.With our project, we hope to improve the understanding about synthetic biology and GMOs.If the use of GMOs was legal, our yeast based detection system could provide an easy and affordable solution.Additionally, as we learned how restricted the knowledge about our topic is, we have been able to adjust our presentations better for the targeted audiences.We have given much consideration to the ethical implications of our work.As we had also gotten sponsorships from certain companies they posted about us and our project on their web pages which was nice.In addition, LAL will publish an article in their member magazine about our iGEM experience after the Jamboree.In both meetups, we were presented with the idea of patenting one\u0092s work.It was great to see that so many people were interested in our project as well as modelling in synthetic biology.Many of these experts gave us much appreciated information and new aspects to our ideas that have guided our project towards what it is today.He also questioned our choice to use yeast at all in the enzyme production, and made us broaden our thinking and justify our ideas.They guided us to plan our detection device so that it would correspond to the current need - being available for the public and not be too expensive.This convinced us that we were on right track with the degradation.Our project was on display in the media.In Paris, we participated in a panel discussion where part of the discussion was about patents and the openly communicated nature of iGEM projects.The team\u0092s acceptance of the idea was driven by how popular the problem was in Finland.In addition to Luma we gave a talk on \u0093Mathematical Modelling in Synthetic Biology\u0094 for math students at the University of Helsinki.Hopefully we were able to inspire them to continue with the study of biology in the future and perhaps even try themselves in the field of synthetic biology.In addition, to adopt a biological containment strategy, we would engineer several essential proteins in our yeast cells to have a dependency on non-standard amino acids for their proper translation, folding and function, as described by Mandell et al.This was supposed to be part of our project, but unfortunately time constraints prevented us from doing this.We want to stir up the conversation about GMO legislation, and be part of the discussion about how GMOs could be used outside of the lab and by general public.After giving them a \u0093Biology 101\u0094 lecture, they got to hear how modelling was done in our project.The article was later posted also on the university\u0092s main news page.It seemed that the general conception of synthetic biology was something quite foreign and that there is a need for raising awareness of the hazards of cyanobacteria.However, as our plan would be to use the capsules for small quantities of water (bucket-scale), releasing this capsule in just one bucket of water alleviates such concerns; as the enzymes are scaled for such a small quantity, they would be extremely diluted when released to the open environment.All of the interviewed people were familiar with it but didn\u0092t know much about the health or economic problems it causes.We consider them a part of our human practices since we got a lot of input from them for our project, and got to talk about our ideas with other iGEMers.It is necessary to properly design the kit so that the yeast cells are contained within the device, in addition to placing biosafety measures for the possibility that the GMOs would escape the device, either caused by the device breaking or because of product misuse.The kind of synthetic auxotrophy described by Mandell can be considered a more advanced and secure method of biocontainment, and in particular if combined with still other containment strategies, it would make it highly unlikely that our yeast could bypass the biocontainment.We have also been or will be a part of our sponsors\u0092 blogs.We also discussed current detection methods and according to them, all the available detection methods are rather expensive and hardly any of them is available for the public.We hope that this has helped people follow our work better and in a way bring them closer to our research and what it is like to be a part of an iGEM team.The precautionary principle is a concept used in risk management and according to it, if an action is suspected to be harmful for the public or the environment and there is no scientific agreement on the matter, then the burden of proof that it is not harmful lies on the party which is carrying out the suspected action.This gave us additional courage to choose our GMO yeast sensor as our project idea.As multiple genes would be dependent on the synthetic amino acids, escaping biocontainment via mutagenesis would require mutations in a large number of genes.In order to gain more insight into the problem of cyanobacteria in Finland, we contacted the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.Even though many experts gave us advice and guided our brainstorming, deciding about the topic and more precise plans were left for ourselves.We met with high school students who were candidates for the Finnish team of the International Biology Olympiad.to spread the word of iGEM as well as tell people about our project and about ourselves.They described the full extent of algae detection problem in Finland and all the strategies used in the past and at the moment to deal with it both in research and industry.They found our approach interesting and promising since they have been trying to deal with the blue-green algae problem for many years now.It was discussed that communication really is the key when trying to create business in this field, and that researchers should learn how to communicate about this seemingly outlandish field to the general public.It was also nice to hear that there was no available method for the present day to get rid of the cyanobacteria or the toxins.We talked with experts from different universities and research centers in the fields of biology, genetic engineering, biological modeling and cyanobacterial research.In large part, negative attitudes towards GMOs can stem from connotations of certain words, as well as the perception of strangeness in the daily lives of people.The Gene Technology Act is based on the EU Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC, which concern the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment and the contained used of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), respectively.In high concentrations, lysozyme could also have drastic effects on the ecosystem, as it can can lyse the cell walls of many bacteria.As discussed above, our conclusion was that it didn\u0092t seem relevant to our project.Without them we probably wouldn\u0092t have thought to use flow cytometry, which ended up providing important support and verification for our other results!We also got good practise on how to communicate with people who don\u0092t have much background in biology, not to mention synthetic biology.This would allow detection of microcystin in the water while ensuring that the yeast stays inside the device.Algol has posted a few posts about our journey in iGEM on their blog, and want to also publish something once we return from Boston.We wanted our products to have minimal side-effects on the environment and that meant limiting the reach of any genetically modified organism present in those products.The broadcast of the episode can be listened here: http://areena.yle.fi/1-3424583 (in Finnish).Their input greatly affected our choice of using modified yeast as the detection chassis organism.Our degradation enzyme capsule, on the other hand, would not contain any living cells - only commercial lysozyme and enzymes derived from the genetically modified microorganisms.TEK magazine, the magazine of Tekniikan akateemiset, an organization for Academics of Technology, published an article about us as well.We found about the Cyanobacteria research group of the University of Helsinki and met with them.They also gave us input on our results and gave ideas on possibilities to take things further, e.g.(Geenitekniikan lautakunta) As it is impossible to predict the cascade of consequences resulting from GMOs being released into the environment, caution in this respect is well-advised.The enzyme has a specificity for the Adda-arginine bond, which is only present in cyanotoxins.This would have to be done in an especially fool-proof manner if the kit was to be commercialized.We reasoned that by working with baker\u0092s yeast (common name for Saccharomyces cerevisiae), an organism familiar to most people with neutral if not positive connotations, our work would feel more approachable to and less detached from people\u0092s everyday lives.In addition, the genetic material of decomposed GMOs could be taken up by other organisms, leading to even more possibilities for unwanted consequences.In Finland, the Gene Technology Act regulates the use of GMOs and promotes the safe use and development of gene technology along with ethical practices and consideration of the precautionary principle (Geenitekniikan lautakunta).This gave us a lot to think, since our project\u0092s final product was designed to be a genetically engineered organism used outside the lab.Based on this, we really thought that there was a need to increase knowledge about synthetic biology.It also contains a description of synthetic biology, a safety conscious statement, and an explanation of what iGEM is.", "modeling": "To this end, we have chosen three naturally occurring promoters from genes involved in the yeast\u0092s oxidative stress response: CTT1, CPP1 and TSA1.As part of our project, we are designing a novel detection mechanism for the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin using live yeast cells.In our concept for the detection mechanism, a sample of water, either contaminated with microcystin or not, is supplemented to a culture of live yeast cells.As an Oxidative Stress Response mechanism, Yap1p is localized and accumulated in the nucleus.Meanwhile, the other two promoters have binding sites for Yap1p and for a third transcription factor Skn7p.The essential principle is to couple the yeast\u0092s natural response against the toxin to the production of a yellow ?uorescent protein, Venus.To study our detection mechanism mathematically, we have created a model for the transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7 and their activation in the cells, hoping to determine production patterns and thresholds of YFP and provide suggestions for optimal promoter design for future iterations of the project.CTT1 has a single binding site for a transcription factor known as YAP1 and at least one binding site for the factor MSN2.The detection mechanism then functions as follows: the genetically modi?ed yeast take the toxin in through a specific transporter (QDR2 from strain VL3), after which the toxin inhibits the function of protein phosphatases in the cell.The cell naturally ?ghts against this accumulation of harmful oxygen species through a mechanism known as

cost associated with it; this makes it far from a globally attainable solution for copper removal (Bhatnagar & Sillanpaa, 2010).Although each of these methods is successful to a degree in removing copper from water, none exist without detrimental pitfalls (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).At least two-third of all First Nation communities in Canada have been under water advisory at some time in the last decade (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015).Although these methods are generally the most economical, and low in technology costs, they all involve plant growth, which render disadvantages due to dependence on growth conditions, requirement of large-scale agricultural equipment, and knowledge, long remediation timelines and potential environmental harm due to leaching of soluble contaminants (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).It is possible to bypass this problem by using the protein YiaT anchor system designed by Han and Lee to bind and sequester copper outside the cell (2014).Furthermore, the solubility of metal hydroxides poses the problem of precipitating one heavy metal out of solution, and another back in due to their individual maximum precipitation pH\u0092s (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).Han and Lee discovered that when truncated at the arginine residue 232 (R232), the Pseudomonas lipase could be fused to the new C-terminal end of YiaT to make a functional fusion protein (2014).Currently, the removal of copper from water is accomplished through a slew of methods ranging from large-scale and industrious technologies to small-scale household friendly products.The community of Trail, BC has battled pollution from Teck Metals since 1975 (Hume 2016).The community is afflicted with contaminated landfills, slag deposits that leach into waterways and a substantial plume that has spread beneath the city and the Columbia River (Hume 2016).Particularly, Alexis Creek First Nation, Nazko First Nation and Lake Babine, all in British Columbia, have water problems spanning 16 years (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015).Our team is investigating methods of copper binding in order to contribute to the promising advancement of this remediation method.Children from the community have also demonstrated elevated levels of lead in their blood (Hume 2016).This poses a problem when attempting to use E. coli to remove heavy metals from water.Remediation of heavy metals in drinking water and

polycistronic B genes whose first gene codes for the LacI repressor.In daytime, polycistronic A genes will not be expressed, there will be no CI repressor to prevent the transcription of the polycistronic B genes.Thus, butyrate will be produced and the LacI repressor will repress the polycistronic A genes.The phosphoryl group will be subsequently transfered to the transcription factor OmpR, which then, will upregulate genes expressed from the POmpC promoter .In contrast, with light, PCB prevents the Cph8 autophosphorylation.OmpR will not be activated and the genes under POmpC will not be expressed.This circadian switch is further improved by integrating a NOT logic gate into the regulation circuitry.This is achieved using the phage lambda cI repressor (BBa_K1587006) as well as the bacterial LacI repressor.The genetic system has been designed to be switched on and off in response to light [2].Whitout light, Cph8 autophosphorylates its EnvZ intracellular domain while

have been performed:Growth tests in TPX\u00ae: Culture of the strain E. coli BW25113 in a TPX\u00ae bag (ie.Moreover, the modeling showed that this version of the trap is yet to be optimized to ensure a proper diffusion of our molecules, see more in \"Modeling\" part.The 3D printer used to construct our trap and the result of 3D printing: TrApiColiThe use of genetically modified organisms in a field associated with edible products requires to carefully consider the issues of safety, national legislation, and public opinion.In this context, we looked for a solution that would isolate our engineered bacteria from the environment, while still allowing its growth and gas diffusion.We found the solution in the iGEM Groeningen 2012 project that used a special polymer called TPX\u00ae in order to keep their bacteria from contaminating meat, their edible product.TPX\u00ae is composed of Polymethylpentene, a porous polymer, and is commercialized by the company MitsuiChemicals (4-methylpentene-1 based polyolefin, Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.).Thus, the trap was designed to be placed at the entrance of the hive, in order to act before infection and try to prevent the entry of as many mites as possible.The bees usually enter the hive by landing on the bottom board before walking inside.As in the Groeningen 2012 project, our bacteria need to be separated from the growth medium until the beekeeper decides to use the trap.Thanks to that, the trap can be easily and perfectly installed on the hive by the beekeepers without drilling or cutting.The trap was designed using Catia and then 3D printed in order to build a prototype.In order to get the best out of ApiColi in the treatment of varroosis, we designed a trap named TrApiColi.This trap could not be tested without coating because the porous plastic used for 3D printing is permeable to liquids and gases.Because of the alignment of the trap with the board, it will not disturb the bees  comings and goings.TrApiColi was thought up to take into account ethical reflection, safety and ease of use for beekeepers.Since the switch between the production of the two molecules is regulated by light, our bacteria need to be outside of the beehive.in microaerobic conditions, without agitation and miming batch culture condition), as it would be in the fieldGas diffusion tests: Permeability of butyric acid and formic acid through the TPX\u00ae bagCarbone source test: choice of a carbon source to produce acids during at least 10 daysThis channeling does not disturbs the bees.The dimensions of the trap allow it to adapt to almost every beehive.", "human_practice": "It was a great starting pointfor us to start some indepth conversation with them about what they knew of DNA and what could be done with it.Some of them weren t aware that banana had DNA at all and some teachers told us that our demonstration was very well designed and easy to understand without distorting the truth.The stand having drawn everybody\u0092s attention (thanks to the pungent smell of smashed bananas), our intervention was broadcasted on a local TV (TLT[1]), and we were also selected to take part in International ExpoSciences in Brussels.To carry on with our education mission, we agreed with one of the science teachers from the Leonard de Vinci junior high school of Tournefeuille to meet with the students.On the other hand it is also crucial to make sure that our molecules do not have a negative impact on the bees.Early on in the project, we thought about how best to address the biocontainment issue regarding our bacterial system.Most of the children were not antagonized to the use of a modified bacterium as long as it was confined in our Trapicoli, but we felt that the biological knowledge needed to fully understand synthetic biology was a little foreign to them, so we switched our lecture to focusDuring the Q and A, we were asked about our studies and the kind of diploma we had.In these societies, living beings are held to be untouchable, it is thus necessary to comprehensively explain what synthetic biology is, what our project is, as well as what experiments we are conducting in the lab in order to give clues and keys to people having no background in this field so that we can start to have a discussion with them.It actually seems that we do not have the power to control them entirely, we can only act on a few metabolic pathways, a few functions, at the same time.When discussing the different concepts and approaches of synthetic biology, we have to take into account that ethical reflections depend on the core values of a society and thus differ from one to the other.But, as it was not in our aim to use their research to commercialize an attractive solution of Varroa destructor, we decided to base our research attractive module on the result of this US patent.We had to use a DNA construction designed by Dr Christopher Voigt from Voigt Labs, MIT.You can learn more about this in the video below.Apart from this physical containment, we were also thinking of adding to our system an auxotrophy to a specific nutriment not found in the natural environment.INSA Toulouse is a public school for engineers thus the biosafety guidelines are not specific to our institution; the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms are applied.The regulation on workers  protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No.Christianity having been predominant historically in Western Europe, it still has an influence on people\u0092s minds and a notion that could be assimilated to sin still clings to the modification of organisms.We can then ask ourselves the following questions: is it possible to have control over organisms, and if yes, to which extent?In fact, the trap we designed is in itself a first barrier, preventing the engineered bacteria from being in contact with their environment (and particularly the bees).Indeed it is often easier to trust someone when the doubts are clearly stated than when everything is allegedly under control but it cannot be verified.Before we can have any kind of ethical reflection concerning our project, we asked ourselves how to best define our \u0093work material\u0094, meaning living beings.But since regulations are different around the world, and to have a complete overview of our project, we decided to reflect on the biosafety issue, if our device were to be put in place on hives.Given that DNA is our main work tool, we decided to engage the children by letting them extract DNA from bananas, with ethanol and dishwashing soap.Add the 50ml of water(must be at ambient temperature), the salt and the Dishwashing soapIn the alcohol layer, a white cloud with bubbles should appear, this cloud is DNA!This simple yet interesting experience helped us attract children to our stand.But when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the general public and the environment.This is why we focused a big part of our energy on communicating with the public, in order to raise awareness about a worrying situation.In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures.As new interns we had to take part in a general training session to learn how to identify the risks and preventourselves and our colleagues from harm.It also informs the employee about the emergency numbers.The second one is a training about the techniques used during our stay concerning microbiological, chemical and incendiary risks.We then have a test to make sure that we were understood and aware of the previous presentations.This is the way in which one will be able to identify the barriers and the fears of the public, and understanding them is the first step to conquer them.Our project took place in a research context.In order to discuss our project with people having a first hand experience of the problem, we joined this forum.Indeed a symbiosis between man and specific bacteria is essential to its survival, and we can wonder what the impact of the modification of bacteria interacting (closely or not) with human beings will be.Anthropocentrism, which places human beings above everything and particularly above nature, is the utilitarian vision.When we first started to reach out to the public we realised that the issue of the decline in bee population was a well-known issue.That\u0092s why we met with a beekeeper (who was also a microbiologist) to discuss our project and the material restrictions we should submit to.Finally, one issue specific to our project is the fact that the small bag containing bacteria would probably have to be manipulated by beekeepers.Hence, a MTA agreement has been filled with Dr Clark Lagarias from UCDavis, so that we could obtain the strain containing the cyanobacterian light sensors from Dr Nico Claassens, Wageningen University in Netherlands.During the summer, our lab was in the engineering school INSA which possesses a safety department with one prevention advisor and several prevention assistants assigned to the laboratories.As mentioned before, ethics was a dimension that was present from the very first stages of the development of our project.Often being questioned about the fact that \u0093researchers play God by modifying living beings\u0094, and the prevailing societal distrust, we naturally developed a reflection about the possible limits to give to our project.Formerly, the field of biology matched its greek definition: bios meaning life and logos, study, biology was indeed the study of life and living beings.Finally we took the opportunity of being in Belgium to organize a quick meetup with the KU Leuven iGEM team.Overall this experience in Brussels was quite intense, we met many people interested in science and it was refreshing to be able to get out of the lab and interact with people about our project.Nevertheless the loss of a bacterial colony does not affect us emotionally in the same way the loss of a swarm does.But iGEM does not stop on the 28th of September, and we have everything planned to keep our education project alive after the competition:The \"Student s week\" occuring in several towns in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region facilitatesthe integration of new students in Toulouse by allowing them to participate in free events organized by diverseTaking place in Toulouse, Scientilivre (\"Science book\") is very rightly named and is there to present both books and scienceto the public.At the very beginning of the project, we were not at all specialists of the bees.It is obvious that we cannot let uncontrolled modified organisms disseminate in the environment.The main threat is thus the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where its DNA or RNA would be in contact with microorganisms present in the external environment.A machine is the assembly of known and controllable components, and this term seems to indicate that we assimilate a living being to a completely characterized system responding to physical and chemical laws.We also chose to place this bag in a solid device, adding yet another barrier between the bacteria and the environment.If patenting an organism were possible, it would lead us back to the perception of life as a machine, or a chemical factory, with no sense of wonder or admiration.The name Biobrick is a reminder of the Lego game and this parallel further asks the question of synthetic biology being conceived as an assembly game.We also spent a good deal of our time explaining the iGEM competition to visitors and participants alike, bringing the synthetic biology field, still quite unknown, into light.This communication experience was fully integrated to the Apicoli project, enhancing its exposure and credibility towards the public.One question leading to another, without realising it we where already giving a full guidance lecture on the choices these children would have to make in the following years (which school to attend and why, why study science, etc...).The relationship between humans and environmental bacteria is close, and even more so with the bacteria in our body.)The Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be set up in research laboratories (including containment), education, analysis, anatomy and surgical pathology, autopsy rooms, and industrial and agricultural facilities where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens.The rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (and thus in all public facilities working in scientific and technological domains) are set out in the Decree No.Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are at the heart of a long-term debate on the use of biotechnology in day-life applications.Finally, we do not aim at completely eradicating the parasite from the environment.If we focus on the human being, according to the law, his body does not belong to him, he only has a right of use.Having a first hand account from students who had to go through the same process not so long ago reassured them and gave them some perspective on their future studies.Synthetic biology is also setting off strong opposing reactions and not only because of the use of GMOs.)The main aim of this intervention was to teach children about varroa and synthetic biology while trying to spark an interest in science in general.We made sure to always check that the water-bathes were turned off at the end of the day.To manipulate into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms we used a Biological safety cabinet (FASTER \u0096 Ultrasafe).On one hand, we consider nature as fragile and in need of protection whereas on the other hand we see it as strong enough to provide all the resources we need to survive.In the previous decades or centuries, our vision of nature was more pragmatic and focused on the fulfilling of our needs.Science cannot assume that the regulation and policies of Research has to be made by scientists only, rather it is its duty to communicate the results of the researches and to have transparency on the experiments conducted.First of all, we decided to work with the E. Coli chassis, since its genome is very well characterized and it was well adapted to the molecules we wanted to produce.We also cleaned the BSC completely every two weeks.We have a dark room dedicated to the use of EtBr and UV.We talked above about the problem of controlling our modified microorganisms, and we put a lot of thought in the biocontainment issue: how could we prevent the dissemination of our E. Coli modified strain?We based the three parts (attract, eradicate and regulate)At the beginning of our brainstorming about the impact of Varroa destructor on honeybees, we found the patent US 8647615 B1 Represented By The Secretary Of Agriculture via their website.We had a very interesting exchange with the beekeepers about our project and synthetic biology in general, explaining about its principle, its interest and the practicability of our solution with the beekeepers.Our team took part in the regional ExpoSciences in Toulouse.Thus we only wish to slow down the infestation by varroa with our system, to grant honeybees enough time to adapt to the menace and reach a balance with Varroa.We also followed several other trainings that allowed us to use technical apparatus such as autoclave or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).The laboratory safety training requirements of the LISBP are detailed in the Rules and Procedures of the LISBP.Every new LISBP employee has to attend this training session regardless of its status (researcher, PhD student, intern...).The training is divided into two parts.During the summer, we had the great chance to meet and talk with a few ethicians: M. Vincent G\u00e9goire-Delory, M. Simon Desbois and Mrs Anne Cambon-Thomsen.In this case, bacteria directly died if they are in contact with the external environment.For the competition, we have to build genetic constructs called Biobricks.This specific plastic called TPX\u00ae is microporous and the size of the pores will not allow the bacteria to pass through.Being aware of the worrying decrease in bee population and having developed an ethical reflection since the beginning of this project, we endeavoured to learn more about the causes of this decrease.This happened at the end of July and our project had matured a lot thus the ExpoSciences was the occasion for us to test its welcome in the real world by exchanging with scientists.For example, if we would like to test our device on an actual hive, it would be by using the chemicals alone, and not the strain that produces them.Hence we asked ourselves the extent to which we could consider our experiments commonplace or ordinary.Our reflection on these ethical issues led us to realize that the reluctance towards the modification of living organisms could be linked to an anthropocentric vision of the world.One might ask if the importance we give to protecting bees does not have its roots in anthropocentrism since bees produce honey, wax and propolis, products we use.He offered us his collaboration, and made available his infrastructures, and his teams.Furthermore, several beekeepers from the forum \u0093La Ruche Warr\u00e9\u0094 heard about the project thanks to the same article.Everything in direct contact with something in this room has to stay there.Two specific trash cans are dedicated to the gloves or paper and the contaminated agarose gels.We have described above the relevant security measures taken all through the summer to minimize the risks of incident in the lab.This has changed in the recent years since biology today does not describe life, but rather tries to rebuild some of its important functions.This evolution induced a certain fear in societies marked by an historical creationism springing from monotheistic religions.This increased our visibility, and thanks to an article we were contacted by the Director of the \u0093Laboratoire Fran\u00e7ais d\u0092Apidologie\u0094 (French Laboratory of Apidology).Therefore the patent does not grant a property right on the biological material.That would designing a specific training for the beekeepers, and a safe way to get rid of the used bags.Another ethical issue that was raised by the concept of modifying living organisms was that of intellectual property.Thus it appears that the use the word machine is somewhat misleading, because biology is much more complicated than that.In order to protect the user, access to the NMR is not allowed for people wearing pacemakers, drug pump systems, staples on soft or hard tissue, and pregnant women.Scientists should be able to acknowledge that they don\u0092t know something rather than lying to the public.Bees, Varroas, an introduction to synthetic biology and, of course, banana DNA extraction!We prepared a short presentation about varroa which was followed by a Q and A session where student were able to interact with us and each other about the disappearance of bees, pesticides, varroa and synthetic biology.This way, the bacteria that receive the genes develop new characteristics such as resistance to an antibiotic.They helped us develop our reflexion and they also shared their knowledge with us while still having the skill to let us think by ourselves.This experience also enabled us to meet his Excellency M. Bernard Valero, the ambassador of France in Belgium, and M. Jean-Claude Guiraudon, CIRASTI President and MILSET Honorary President.Other pollinators that do not supply us with interesting goods, such as wasps, are less considered.Furthermore bees are the first pollinating species in terms of fruits and vegetables produced thus the advantages of protecting them are obvious for global trade.Indeed our system would be optimized to last at most 2 to 3 weeks, after which the bag would have to be replaced.2011-1177 is related to the use of genetically modified organisms.One for biological waste (yellow).Contrarily to what one could think, feeling fear as a scientist is essential and should not be overlooked since this is what makes us be more cautious and take a step back to study the implications of our work.Bees have an essential role as pollinators, that\u0092s why their preservation is a major social and environmental concern.We used the NMR machine that was kindly made available to us by the MetaToul platform to analyse our culture supernatant.Furthermore we tried to design a system that would be as respectful of the bee\u0092s life cycle and products as possible, hence the circadian regulation and natural molecules.Moreover the used parts are also non-pathogenic (the acids doses produced are harmless for humans).With the help of the teacher we were able to explain the basics of synthetic biology, the idea of biobricksand spark a quick debate about GMO use.The bench of the BSC was cleaned with ethanol before and after each manipulation.It is due primarily to the overuse of pesticides that have proven to act as neurotoxins to bees.In fact it seems that normality is illustrated by non living things, completely subjected to the laws of physics and chemistry, and divisible in smaller parts.Still in spite of this, most of the people interviewed weren t aware of the role played by Varroa destructor.Indeed, beeing able to use ethics at an early stage of a scientific project is not only a great opportunity but also a true advantage compared to being included in an already existing project in which you may not have time to think critically.Our project was followed by the regional newspapers (20 minutes, M\u00e9tronews, La D\u00e9p\u00eache), but also by some national magazines such as Capital or Industrie et Technologies.Though it is true that the problem first originated with men, today we cannot solve it by changing our behaviour.In this room, we are able to eat and drink (a fridge, a kettle and a coffeemaker are available) On the contrary, in the lab, we have to wear protective equipment and respect basic rules:We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals.The experience we acquired there was put to good use later and made us able to switch from a full science explanation to a simpler overview of our project without getting boring or simplistic.Indeed using synthetic biology to solve a problem attributed to a human behaviour did not seem relevant to us.When the invisible can have an impact on the visible, fear might arise.You can see here the sterility tests we realized.Another major cause of death for the bees is the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.The Decree No.Naturalists on the contrary believe that nature takes precedence over humans and must be protected from their utilization.A living being can be defined as a thermodynamic open system that receives and passes information, and is in this way a sort of \u0093anomaly\u0094 of nature since it does not tend towards entropy.Numerous products synthesized through the modification of microorganisms (reprogrammed bacteria\u0085) are currently of great significance.This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5.We further realized that the iGEM competition is the perfect moment to develop our ethical thinking.Our team had the wonderful opportunity to take part in the International ExpoSciences in Brussels.The ability to carry out this type of deliberation, to question one\u0092s own work, is what singles out a good scientist, in our opinion.Some colonies in Europe seem to start developing behaviours of the same kind.This one is taken individually with the NEO software and the explanations of the prevention assistant.This is a powerful but very expensive equipment, based on the magnetic resonance of the atoms.", "modeling": "In our case these maximum values are: Yet, we are interested in the combined effect of AHL and leucine production on the growth rate.From an optimization perspective the equation $mathbf{Sv} = 0$ represents constraints, which guide the numerical In our case the $mathbf{S}$ matrix comes from the in silico E. coli model K-12 MG1665.In our case we are interested in the leucine and AHL production rates of the type A cells and their effect on the growth rate of the bacteria.It also shows that cell A can not operate at the maximum production rate, because the growth rate would then be so slow that cell B would overgrow it.The second reaction of interest is: $$ \text{acylACP} + \text{SAM} \rightarrow \text{ACP} + \text{MTA} + \text{AHL} $$This reaction is important because AHL serves as the key to the motility system of cell B.If our promoters are too strong, the growth rate of cell A will be too low and cell B will be able to overgrow cell A.The metabolic network of the organism in question is represented as a matrix $mathbf{S}$  of size $m \times n$ .This is very important because if cell A has a big metabolic burden and thus, a very low growth rate, cell B would overgrow it and our pattern formation system would not work.To check the effect of our system on the growth rate iGEM Toulouse ran a FB analysis.Finally, the  vector $mathbf{x}$ is defined to contain the concentrations of each metabolite.Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.This is why Toulouse also modeled the effect of one biomolecule, but with the constraint that the other biomolecule is produced at maximum rate.Next  a vector $mathbf{v}$ of length $n$ is defined which contains the flux through each reaction.Here the vector $mathbf{c}$ represents a weight vector.Given this information the Toulouse team was able to locate the reactions of interest in the XML model file, and simulate the cell metabolism.This is something to keep in mind when we choose our promoters for the system.Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.This is the flux that corresponds to a growth rate of 0.This matrix is filled with the stoichiometric constants of each reaction.In generally it follows from the analysis that the more AHL or leucine is produced the smaller the biomass output becomes.The steady state solution Which is the nullspace of $mathbf{S}$.We see that the production values are way smaller in this simulation.We cooperated with Toulouse on the modeling.Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.Each of the $m$ matrix rows represents a unique compound.", "notebook": "This successful event was a good opportunity for us to start learning how to design a poster and to communicate about synthetic biology.We held our first meeting without instructors to discuss the design of the constructions needed to create the engineered bacteria.The butyrate genes were cloned into the PL-LacI-ccr pUC57 Plasmid.Blandine took part to iGEM meetup France organized by iGEM Bordeaux Team, where she met different teams, discussing with them, and presenting our project.To do so we designed a booklet explaining our project and what iGEM is.We first started searching for genes that we would like to have in our constructions on the iGEM registry.After we successfully designed our construct we started thinking about what our device would look like.How does the competition works and what are the important deadlines?Those presentations gave us the opportunity to understand more about the iGEM competition and to get to know each other (since we don\u0092t all come from the same institutions).First team meeting, our instructors informed us on the competition more specifically and how the team is organized.Here are few examples of projects reviewed: Our youngest instructor and team mother Mathilde B\u00e9raud went with Beno\u00eet Pons to the FSIE committee, and thanks to their intervention, we obtained \u0080 4000 !Start again for the ones that did not work...The first cloning worked for the final construction: a first step has been completed (the formate genes were cloned into the PL-CI pUC57 plasmid).We could now begin the genetic construction, but we faced a problem with the vectors: receptors genes were cloned into vectors incompatible with our final construction plan, so we had to look for an alternative solution.Thomas and M\u00e9lany worked together on the attraction module: production of butyrate We received our synthetic genes after more than one month of waiting for them.Another good news was the success of the first steps of the circadian cloning made by Beno\u00eet Pons Blandine, who created our Ulule account (Ulule is a crowdfunding platform) informed us that it was a real success.They presented a poster on synthetic biology and the iGEM competition.Anthony met Felix from iGEM Stockholm Team, and discussed about the iGEM experience, all the work done at this moment, his disappointments, \u0085 He understood that all iGEM teams were in the same situation: URGENCY.Even if the experiments did not work as expected, all the team smiles again when we received our polo shirts and berets that we will wear in Boston: we are ready to fight !We chose to implement  a circadian rhythm cycle which would allow us to produce toxic molecules during the night when bees are a lot less active.We Skyped with the iGEM Ankara team which is also working on Varroa destructor.We are eager to start, but are a bit pessimistic about the next phase of the project.Two members of our team participated in the Toulouse Exposciences.Indeed, we wanted to combine our efforts to fight against varroa and to gather some data about the mite.Now the real fight begins, hoping to achieve that we planed.The synthetic genes, which were cloned into pUC57 vectors, were amplified and then cloned during the weekend.All the team is now waiting for the synthetic genes and training since the 26th of June.Our reflection led us to the conclusion that our construction should respect the bee life cycle.Two projects were still in course to be chosen, the use of ice nucleating proteins to purify water and the creation of a  bio trap against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.Our first mission was to prepare a presentation for the next week on the following themes:Previous subjects.Following the newspaper articles published we discovered a forum of beekeepers discussing about our project on the web.We realised that our the cloning part would be quite long because of the number of genes needed to obtain... We therefore decided to order synthetic sequences for our synthetic pathway constructions.Laetitia Chaumont, Benoit Pons and Mathilde Beraud went to a laboratory studying varroa(Vacbio EA 4357).Nonetheless, good mood of the team!the bacteria should not produce both attractive and toxic molecules at the same time.This last one was chosen to be our project on the grounds that it  was the most feasible.Every group of two or three students presented one of the subjects seen above.The formate genes (pflA and pflB), the butyrate genes without ccr and the POmpC-LacI box-CI were cloned into pSB1C3.Based on bibliography, the initial idea was to build an engineered bacteria which will have to produce butyrate to attract the parasite.In order to achieve this, Valentin Girin used the software Catia for the modeling of our device.Culture tests were realized for different concentrations of the Biosilta medium.Therefore, we decided to set up a more optimised protocol to assess the attraction of varroa by butyrate.We finished the design of our constructions and send it to our instructors for checking.The production of formic acid in the culture of the producing strain was followed.During the whole week we searched for ways to produce our molecules cyclically.Those results are directly linked to the undergoing cytotoxicity tests.We also initiated the creation of the plans that would be used to 3D print our device.We did cloning trainings to be as efficient as possible, Beno\u00eet Pons and Marine Pons succeeded the first cloning at the first attempt !!We also learned more about the beekeeping activity and the treatments used to fight against the parasite.Laetitia Chaumont obtained a meeting with Vincent Gr\u00e9goire Delory, the ethician of Toulouse White Biotechnology (TWB).Since our bacteria needed to perceive red light we decided to place our device at the entry of the hive but outside.Moreover, it was time to choose attributions to make the project management easier, below in the table, the main assignments.The following weeks were the subject of extensive researches on the topic.They were pleasantly surprised that we took the time to answer all their questions!We prepared some M9 medium, and also did a cytotoxicity test of formic acid thanks to a plate reader.An enzymatic test was done on the Biosilta kit with an OD reading, until the stabilization of bacterial growth.Melissa David, Melany Tanchon and Louise Gody went to Brussels to attend the international Exposciences for the whole week.No doubt, this is the final effort before the dreadful wikifreeze !!The presentations were divided in the following parts.The following weeks were spent brainstorming.During this period, we were informed by iGEM toulouse instructors of what this competition is, and what was expected of us.Strong headaches and itching eyes but still on the computer ?Fighting with HTML tags and continuously looking at the clock ?We received from Dr Nico Claasens lab (Wageningen University) the strains containing PCB en Cph8 vectors responsible for the circadian regulation.However two parameters had to be improved because butyrate is a very volatile molecule and we conducted experiments in a petri dish thus diffusion complicated the interpretation.!We did a cytotoxicity test of butyric acid and we were trained to be able to use the NMR machine.There is only one month left and we have to work harder to reach project goals.We realised two tests: one is a test culture on BW25113 strain under aerobic and micro aerobic conditions.The next step was to present every week, two new project ideas.", "protocol": "At the end of first pipe put a sterile cone and immerse it into Eppendorf with NaHCO3After 24 hours culture, press 10 mL syringe in order to expel gas in NaHCO3 solutionNote 1: We used culture in M9 because with the \u0093Acids production tests\u0094 we had data on this medium.Note 2: 10 mM NaHCO3 solution was used because pH was 8.3 so it would permit acid gas solubilisation.Protocol for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), From Thermo Scientific\u0099 DreamTaq\u0099 Green PCR Master Mix Place a thin-walled PCR

minutes and inactive at 80 \u00b0C during 30 minutes.6.Transform commercial ultra-competent cells (108 to 109 cfu/\u00b5g DNA) with 2.5 \u00b5L of the ligation using provided with the competent cells.In the end we worked with these concentrations:Usually we set 250 cycles around 24 hours so we have an OD measurement every six minutesTo do that centrifuge the appropriate volume of pre-culture, then remove LB medium and resuspend sediment with M9 medium to inoculate.Note: This step permits to eliminate substrates from LB medium which could interfere during NMR analysis.Place erlenmeyers in incubator 37 \u00b0C 130 rpm and TubeSpin\u00ae Bioreactor in incubator 37 \u00b0C without agitationAdd 100 \u00b5L of sample in spectrophotometer cuvette, complete with 900 \u00b5L

have to do several cultures at the same time.So, we use an optical For each standard solutions : in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf sample 10 \u00b5L and add 1 mL Bradford\u0092s Reagent, wait 20 minutes and measure OD505 nmPlot glucose concentration in function of OD505nm and determine the linear region In order to test if E. coli produces formic acid and butyric acid with genes added, we made culture test with modified bacteria.The only change is that no filters were used because the sterility is not necessary.Close the small bag via fusing machine and Put the closed small bag in a Steril laboratory flaskPositive Control: Inoculate a culture tube at OD600 nm = 0.1 in LB medium (Final Volume = 20 mL)2.When varroa heads for one side of Glass T tube and covers more than 2 cm test is over and we write down the side choosen by varroa (Butyric acid or Water)treatment they place a diffuser at the top of the hive and formic acid concentration As gas concentration is difficult to evaluate we calculated the liquid concentration balance using the ideal gas law and Henry\u0092s law.Put 20 \u00b5L of sample + 6 \u00b5L of marker (1 kb for 1 % gel and 100 pb for 2 %) into the well1a.In order to have varroas in the same phase it is necessary to add one step and it is important for reproducibility of theexperiments.For butyric acid, the concentration chosen 4 % (V/V) because this is the concentration used in the patent quoted (see \u0093Attribution\u0094 part).We used water as a negative control.For this test we use varroas directly from frames because we did not have enough standardized varroas.Tap on Petri dish and see if varroa moves.We used the same protocol as \u0093Culture on Erlenmeyers and TubeSpin\u00ae Bioreactors\u0094 with some changes: The objective of our device is to produce gas, so we would like to know the gas composition of our culture.For longer products, the extension time has to be prolonged by 1 min/kb.The last step consisting in the elution of the DNA is made with elution buffer or water at 55 \u00b0C 2.Use micropipet tip (plastic) To freeze: aliquot cell in 200 ?L volumes into prechilled 0.5 mL microfuge tube (on ice) 1.Plate several

the tubes and on the plate (A, B, C, \u0085)  4.To test gas permeability of TPX\u00ae plastic, we use the same protocol as \u0093Test of gas concentration\u0094.Each PCR reaction has to be adapted to the length of the PCR products, and to the melting temperature Tm of the primers.With this method we place varroas on adult bees so all varroas will be in phoretic phase.With small brush take varroas from Petri dish and put them on bees in box through aeration holesPlace the box in a 35 \u00b0C incubator overnight.Resuspend cells in 10 mL of ice-cold TFB1 with gentle re-pipetting.The extension step lasts 1 min for PCR products up to 2 kb.To simplify calculation we noted down formic acid A.We chose a positive control with a higher concentration, 2 mol.L-1, and then decreasing concentration in order to identify which minimum concentration could kill varroa.In the beginning we tested high and low concentrations and we further adapted the concentrations.Resuspend cells in 2 mL of ice-cold TFB2 with gentle re-pipetting.", "result": "Our results were in line with our objective to produce acids in a microporous bag because we demonstrated that with microaerobic conditions, To convert the concentration of formate into formic acid we used the famous Henderson Hasselbalch equation:As mentioned in the Eradicate part, our goal was to produce 50 \u00b5M of formic acid to kill varroa, and this corresponds to 77,7 mM of formate.Under our microaerobic conditions, the wild type E. coli strain produced 32 mM of formate.Aerobic conditions were obtained with a classical Erlenmeyer incubated at 37 \u00b0C with agitation.We used a minimal M9 medium to identify formic or butyric acid production by NMR.Aim: to measure formate production of wild-type strains in microaerobic conditionsIn order to plot biomass concentration we converted the OD values with the following equation:Substrate and products concentration was inferred from the peak area of each molecule on the NMR spectrum.Butyrate production from this pathway remains to be demonstrated prior to testing the strain with varroas.In order to determinate the amount of formic acid required to kill the mite, we tested different concentrations of formic acid on varroas as explained in the Protocol part.Figure 5: Mortality of varroas as a function of time for different formic acid concentrationsFigure 6: Histogram representing mortality of varroas after 2 hours and after 7 hoursFigure 7 presents a dose-dependency of formic acid on varroa mortality.In order to quantify the production of butyrate and formate in these conditions, we  first performed a test with a high concentration of the enzyme (50 U/L) and measured the kinetics of the polymer degradation.Figure 23: Kinetics of Biosilta polymer degradation measured with glucose release.The modeling suggests that concentration the Biosilta medium should even improve formate and butyrate productions but the experimental validation of this production has shown that this is not compatible with E. coli growth.In order to measure BW25113 resistance to different acids concentrations we tested two medium: LB and M9 with 15 mM glucose.For a perfect regulation it would have been necessary to delete the chromosomic version Conclusion: the wild type E. coli strain produces formate in microaerobic conditions but production has to be further improvedAs explained here calculation of the survival of bacteria was perfomed via colony counting after plating on solid agar medium.In order to characterize the E. coli strain growth in the conditions we plan to use in our device, we used a culture under aerobic and micro-aerobic conditions, measured the growth rate (OD) and analyzed the supernatant to measure the concentration of fermentation products.Using a more porous plastic Conclusion: formate permeates through the TPX\u00ae while butyrate exchange will need to be improvedThe bacteria impermeability of the TPX\u00ae was tested through inoculation of the strain  E. coli BW 25113 in M9 defined medium complemented with glucose inside the bag.As explained in the \"Results\" part, \"attract\" section, our objective was to produce at least 0.00001%, so the modelling indicates that we can theoretically reach it.Nevertheless, in order to have this glucose release production, it was necessary to calculate Knowing that one Biosilta kit contains the equivalence of 13 g/L of glucose, we should therefore concentrate the medium 7 times.Thus, we tested different concentrations of Biosilta medium with different enzyme concentrations.Conclusion: Biosilta medium has to be used in a more concentrated manner to reach our growth objectives.Aim: to determine if we can concentrate Biosilta medium to improve the concentration of fermentation products.We do not have the exact composition of Biosilta medium and cannot ascertain innocuity of higher titers of the polymer on growth.In order to model production in the most similar conditions to fit real experiment we chose a glucose rate of 0.0403 g.L-1.h-1 that correspond to 0.72 U/L of enzyme.To convert formate production into formic acid concentration we used equation (3).Thus, to build a biobrick with the full pathway, we cloned the ccr gene with all the genes necessary for butyrate production, as presented below: Figure 2: assembly of the synthetic pathway leading to butyrate production (5192 Kb).On a first assay, we did not detect any permeation of butyric acid through the TPX\u00ae bag.We hypothesized that in presence of a carbon source, we may be able to extend even further their survival time period.Figure 22: Bacteria survival test performed with the BW25113 strain on M9 with 15 mM of glucose during 15 days.The cylinder on the left contains the TPX\u00ae bag with E. coli BW 25113 immersed in M9 medium after 27 hours of growth at 37 \u00b0C.Test of two conditions: without enzyme and with [Enzyme] = 0.72 U/L Figure 25 (right panel) shows that the polymer is not degraded by E. coli which is probably capable of finding another carbon source within the Biosilta medium.Aim: modeling the production of formic and butyric acids as a function of the glucose release rates.We tested our genetic construction in the E. coli strain BW25113 but we did not detect butyrate production.Growth was visualy assessed in the bags after 17 hours at 37\u00b0C (figure 14), or with a culture in tube with agitation as a control over the same period (figure 15).Culture of E. coli BW25113 in M9 medium with [glucose] = 15 mM, at 37 \u00b0CGlucose was consumed approximately at the same rate for both conditions but was converted differently depending on the condition.Shortly, a solution of butyrate or formate was placed in the TPX\u00ae bag.To improve the production of butyrate, we repeated the experiment in a strain with a deletion of the phosphate acetyltransferase gene.of the first DNA fragment matches 5192 pb (butyrate construction) and the size of the second one (2070 pb) matches linearized pSB1C3.In order to test butyrate production, we cultivated ApiColi under micro-aerobic conditions to simulate the growth conditions in the device.Thus, the strain E. coli BW 25113 has been inoculated in a small bag that was sealed.According to the modelling results described in figure 28, we have to produce around 100\u00b5mol/L of butyric acid that corresponds to 0.0092% (V/V).Conclusion: The synthetic formate operon is ready to be used in E. coli and sent to the registryFor formate production, we designed a synthetic polycistron coding for pyruvate formate lyase and its activator protein.Culture under micro-aerobic conditions in 10 mL falcon, result obtained after 28.5 hours of culture.Unfortunately we could not detect butyric acid in our NMR analysis, but we observed significant differences for other fermentation products, proving that the synthetic pathway is actually interfering with the fermentation products metabolism.Figure 27: Modelling formic acid production as a function of glucose release for different growth rates (in h-1).Figure 8: assembly of the synthetic pathway leading to formate production (3090 Kb).Figure 33: pH of the two media in function of the concentration of formic acid and butyric acid.As a first step to develop our regulation module, we replaced the butyrate pathway by the RFP reporter gene and the formate pathway by GFP reporter gene.Each condition was tested three times.It is clear that in M9 medium the pH remains at pH 7 at high acid concentrations but not in the LB medium.Optimizing this production will have to be achieved before testing the strain capacity to kill varroas.We want to express the butyrate synthetic pathway by day and the formate synthetic pathway by night.On the right, the negative control cylinder contains a bag of TPX\u00ae without bacteria after 27 hours of growth at 37 \u00b0C.We then assessed the biomass evolution during long term growth in the TPX\u00ae bag (7 to 10 days).We then made a biobrick by subcloning the polycistron in the pSB1C3 plasmid (BBa_K1587007).Figure 9: extracellular substrate and product concentrations with or without formate polycistron overexpression under micro-aerobic conditions.Figure 9 shows that the only difference between ApiColi and the control is in the formate accumulation, so we plotted the specific histogram for formate after 3 days (Figure 10).Over this time, no growth was detected in the medium surrounding the plastic bag.For our system to be efficient, it was necessary to check that butyrate and formate could permeate through the TPX\u00ae bag.Hence, we used the mentioned 4 % butyric acid concentration, like the one first mentioned in the patent.Figure 28: Modelling of butyric acid production as a function of glucose release for different growth rates.We observed a maximal formate concentration of 25mM (Figure 9).Therefore our production level is not far from the target.We then checked the viability of the cells after 10 days of growth in the TPX\u00ae bag (tube 1, 1  and 2) or in the control tube (tube 3), by spreading diluted volume of the cultures on Petri plates.For the formic acid, we were able to detect it in the gas, probably because its pKa is lower than the butyric acid one.The cph8 biobrick was not obtained but we managed to build a biobrick (BBa_K1587008) with the cph8 encoding sequence under the control of a strong promoter originated from the biobrick (BBa_J23119).In order to have a global idea of the release of glucose per unit of time we then calculated the average rate of release with the following formula:the rate of glucose release necessary to have glucose during 13 days can be calculated with the following formula.Conclusion: It is possible with a Bio Silta Kit to have a continuous release of glucose for 13 days only the one calculated previously.Figure 26: Modeling of formic acid production as a function of different growth rates for a glucose release of 0.0403 g.L-1.h-1.Moreover, it would consume less glucose per hour so we would need a lower polymer concentration in our bag at the beginning.We hypothesized that by deleting the various production pathways for lactate, acetate and ethanol and the degradation pathway forConclusion: Fermentation products concentration can be improved with the enzymatic degradation of the Biosilta polymer.Choice of the carbon source to sustain formic and butyric acids production during 10 days24 hours.This technology is based on polymer degradation by an depolymerisation enzyme leading to a perfect control of the quantity of substrate released in the medium for a given period of time.At 10mM formic acid, all varroas died before three hours but as we explained in the Protocol part, varroas also stop moving at lesser concentrations.In the US patent US 8647615 B1, the concentration of butyric acid that attracts varroa mites is 4 % (V/V), but the final description specified the concentration is efficient from 0.00001 %.However, in the Cytotoxicity part of the results, we also showed that this 4% concentration is lethal for bacteria.Acquisition of the growth stopped due to a problem with the plate reading system where the bacteria where growing.Each condition is tested in three replicates and standard deviation is represented in orange.In M9 medium, the growth is slower at the beginning of the growth curve, however the maximum value of OD reached is almost the same for both medium.The concentration of products (left panel) is clearly different in the two conditions: with the enzyme, more fermentation products are formed.Fermentation products have high concentrations in comparison to the cultures in performed in M9 (15 mM glucose), around 20 times more for lactate, 3 times more for acetate and 2 times more for ethanol.These genes were amplified by PCR and subcloned in pSB1C3 (at this step, a RBS was added to sequence during the PCR).The molecules exchanged between the bag and the surrounding air were desorbed in a solution of sodium bicarbonate.Our final objective was to prepare a bag containing bacteria producing alternatively butyric acid (during the day)and formic acid (during the night) and for a period of time of at least ten days (so that beekeepers don t have to change them every morning...).Doing so, it should be easy to assess the functioning of the light sensor and the NOT logic gate since the colonies should be red by day and green by night.To do so, we synthesized the pOMPC-cI gene (new biobrick BBa_K1587006)Through subcloning the GFP reporter gene (BBa_E0240) was placed under control of this promoter.Except for the 1.5 U/L enzyme concentration, there was an increase of OD in all conditions during 12 days.Culture with BW25113 on 48 wells plate and optical readerFrom these three figures it is evident that we cannot reach the growth level that is expected and that concentrated Biosilta is actually detrimental to growth.Conclusion: concentrating the Biosilta medium is not compatible with E. coli growth.The Biosilta medium was successfully used to have a continuous release of glucose over two weeks.The culture tube contains bacteria growing in parallel of the biological sample tubes shown above (t = 17 hours, 37 \u00b0C, 130 rpm).Additional experiments will be needed to go further (test of our enzymes expression, measurements of intracellular pools to identify metabolic locks, growth at other pH, deletions to prevent the accumulation of other fermentation products as explained in [1]...).Conclusion: butyrate production has to be improved in our strain and under our conditions Butyrate is an effective attractant for varroas.Therefore, formic acid permeats through the TPX plastic.Figure 29: Bacteria growth as a function of time for different concentrations of Biosilta medium.Thus, we only had to clone the synthesized genes into pSB1C3 to be sent to the iGEM registry.At the time of this test, there were not a lot of varroas available, so we add to make only one test in order to hope a significant result.We investigated if the bacteria could grow inside a small bag of TPX\u00ae.OD600 nm served to monitor a putative growth in the external medium.Figure 15: Control of figure 14 with a growth test of E. coli BW 25113 in a culture tube.We concluded that the bacteria are contained in the bag.The growth tendency is toward a continous increase over the experiment time.This strain produces lower amount of acetate, a fermentation product which production is likely to compete with butyrate.Figure 4: Test of butyrate production in E. coli strain deleted for pta gene.After 2 days and until the end, the growth rate changes gradually and becomes constant, at the highest between 2 and 4 days and decreasing thereafter.With the rate of glucose release calculated above, an FBA and FVA simulation were launched as explained in Modeling part.We will now see if buffering our medium has a positive action on growth.Butyric and formic acids production does not stop the growth within our targeted ranges of concentrations.The same experiment was therefore performed by placing directly the bag in the solution of sodium bicarbonate.After having harvested the supernatant of the culture, we filtrated it prior to do NMR analysis.Similar numbers of colonies were obtained, indicating that the cells survival is the same in both culture conditions.to pass outside the bag in the gas phase.Moreover we now know that bacteria do not grow when the pH is around 5.The first arrow represents the promoter, the others represent genes.The first arrow represents the promoter, the others represent genes.There is a visible difference between the two culture media.This showed that the cells were able to proliferate in the plastic bag.Some conversion between the model and the real condition are necessary and they are also explained there.We did not succeed in associating the three genes together behind a strong promoter in pSB1C3 using the In Fusion cloning technique before the iGEM deadline.This phase was therefore not the one to analyse.Both constructions were placed together on the same plasmid but unfortunately sequencing revealed that there was some incoherence in the RFP sequence, preventing further testing.For our project we need to implement a light sensor system in our strain.Figure 14: Growth test of E. coli BW 25113 inside a small bag of TPX\u00ae.to analyse the products and the evolution of the polymer quantity.Likewise, the RFP reporter gene (BBa_K081014) was cloned behind the PL-lacI synthetic gene.This construction (BBa_K1587007) was inserted in the plasmid pSB1C3 to be provided to the iGEM in the biobrick format.", "safety": "", "keywords": "polycistronic chromoprotein standardized expression antibiotic antibiotics beekeepers inhibition spectrophotometer

the way into the future: Space Physics and Synthetic Biology.We have actively been in touch with media, in order to spread the idea of Synthetic Biology to the general public, which is a large part of what makes this competition important.Lastly, we also do collaborations because it is fun!In our project, Biology and Astrophysics are closely intertwined, and as such both disciplines are needed to successfully apply Synthetic Biology to a Mars expedition.We feel that different backgrounds all bring something of value to the table, which is greater than the sum of its parts.Collaboration with other iGEM teams, universities and media has also been one of our focus points.Traditionally, many iGEM teams have been composed of a large majority of people with a biological background.However, SpaceMoss is an interdisciplinary team, with members from a wide range of different academic disciplines like Astrophysics, Molecular Biology, Social Sciences and Business.Below is a picture from one of our presentations held in Uppsala, Sweden at the Nordic iGEM conference.Collaboration with other iGEM helps us make team SpaceMoss better, due to feedback, workshops and interesting discussions, and for that we want to thank all our collaborators.Collaborations is not only necessary to produce a sound and interesting project, but it is also an essential way to tie all our visions together through outreach and lab work.To better communicate to the general public we had our project description turned into a, comic strips and made several short films.The project is keenly focused on

emission.While these results are not conclusive, they suggest a slight increase in the survivability of transformed moss after being frozen at -20*c and -60*c. This increase in survivability could be due to the UNIK antifreeze gene.The transformed moss was able to grow from protoplasts to full clumps on media containing Kanamycin (50 mg/ml), which suggests that the nptII-resistance cassette provides P. Patens with resistance to Kanamycin.To further validate this, an additional experiment were outlined where WT moss was grown on either non-selective PhyB-media (3 plates) or PhyB-media containing Kanamycin 50 mg/ml (3 plates).While the presence of YFP in the transformed antifreeze moss suggest expression of the antifreeze protein, the question remains if the antifreeze protein improves the moss ability to survive cold temperatures.To answer this question, we filled our self designed PhyscoFreezer (see Red lab for more information) with dry ice and put a plate containing 3 transformed clumps of P.patens and a plate of WT moss straight down into the dry ice.A) Moss transformed with the UNIK antifreeze gene 2 days after being frozen.B and C) Moss transformed with the UNIK antifreeze gene 7 days after being frozen.A few days after transformation the moss protoplasts was observed under a fluorescent microscope and YFP-expression was visible in moss protoplasts for the antifreeze and the STS construct (fig.3) YFP filter with 500/20 excitation and 535/30 emission.The transformed moss protoplasts were then moved to PhyB-plates containing Kanamycin (50 mg/ml) and were left to grow for a few weeks.This is a stark contrast to the transformed moss that was able to grow from protoplasts to full clumps and the more vibrant WT moss grown on nonselective media (fig.A) A moss protoplast transformed with the antifreeze construct.No such peak is present for WT or transformed STS moss samples (red, purple lines).The first moss transformation confirmed the function of the Zea Mays ubiquitin promoter (ZmUbi) since YFP was present in the transformed moss protoplasts.This suggests that resveratrol is not produced in the transformed moss.The WT moss planted on Kanamycin containing plates grew very little or not at all and is seen under the microscope as withering (fig.First, the wild type moss clumps looked amorphous and with the rhizoids in a collapsed mass (fig.However, the LC-MS machine was not able to detect resveratrol in the 3 STS transformed moss samples.The same bright autofluorescence and green colour was not observed for the frozen WT moss.This suggests that part of the antifreeze moss was still alive.3 A1), while the antifreeze moss clumps seemed to have conserved their structure.Photo taken 8 days after the moss was planted.The moss protoplasts transformed with the STS-construct were left to grow for 6 weeks.2 days after, strong autofluorescence was observed in one clump of antifreeze moss but not in WT (fig.B) A moss protoplast transformed with our STS construct.From around the time we started in the laboratory, we spent a lot of time just optimizing the PCR reactions for Piece A and C. Not only was it hard to just get a band on the gel, it was also difficult to amplify a high enough amount of each piece, since you need 30 ug of DNA total for our moss transformation protocol.Figure 2: A clump of antifreeze transformed P.Patens showing YFP-expression grown on Kanamycin containing plates (50 mg/ml).C) A moss protoplast transformed with a vector expressing YFP.We also took 3 equal sized clumps of WT moss and put them on new PhyB-media.After 7 days both WT and antifreeze moss looked brown and withered.It demonstrated that the gene construct design works and that moss can combine different DNA pieces with matching overhangs using homologous recombination.We imagine that future teams can do experiments with our antifreeze moss and/or do additional transformations with our lines, to make them even more adapted to the martian environment.100% methanol was used for extraction and both WT moss as a negative control and transformed moss was extracted.One month after transformation, there was ten growing clumps of antifreeze transformed moss.B) Wild type moss grown on kanamycin containing plates (50 mg/ml).B) WT moss 2 days after being frozen.A) WT moss 7 days after being frozen.Secondly, what seems to be cells still containing living chloroplasts were observed on one of the antifreeze clumps.A) Wild type moss on media without kanamycin.This confirms that the transformation was a success and highly suggests that the genes of interest - antifreeze and STS - are expressed.C) Wild type moss without kanamycin on top and with kanamycin on bottem.A peak corresponding to resveratrol without a hydrogen atom 227,1 g/mol, is seen on the standard (fig.The next day the PhyscoFreezer still contained dry ice and we replated our transformed on moss on new PhyB-media.White arrowheads indicate green colour or autofluorescence D) WT moss that has not been frozen.Unfortunately, the ZmUbi promoter sequence had four illegal restriction sites towards the 3  end, which prevented it from being added to the registry as a biobrick.Seven of those clumps of moss were expressing YFP (fig.After transformation of moss protoplasts no transformants expressing YFP was observed.After 6 weeks the protoplasts had grown into small moss clumps.This suggests stable integration of the antifreeze gene construct.It is therefore unlikely that the promoter works without the 3  part, even though single transformants may have been missed under the microscope.Doing PCRs can be surprisingly hard.After 7 days, there was a visible difference in growth between WT on non-selective media and WT on Kanamycin plates (fig.We would then try to verify the promoters function without the 3  end sequence with the illegal restriction sites.", "safety": "This means that work is restricted to genetically modified microorganisms and/or cell cultures, which are not suspected to be pathogenic to humans.Thus our main concerns are to the preserve the natural ecosystem and minimize the risk of spreading transgenic moss into the wild.Our team followed a lab tour concerning the biosafety in the lab provided by experienced laboratory technician Britta Hamberger.We have therefore taken certain precautions in the lab to avoid this worst case scenario as we are working with a GMO after all.The aim of the Treaty is to prevent forward and back contamination during a space mission.To work with GMO there is specific requirements to the laboratory depending on the risk pose by the organisms you work with.(www.at.dk)We also took part of a workshop concerning Biosafety at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) held by the DTU iGEM team.We have transformed Physcomitrella Patens with genes from grapes and a worm.The Resveratrol gene from grapes would most likely not be beneficial for the wildtype moss if it was released back into the wild.The slightly rarer case would be back contamination, which is the risk of bringing unknown lifeforms - if they do exist - back to earth.Biosafety is the prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins and their accidental release, which is important when dealing with gene modified organisms (GMOs).At the workshop we also developed our knowledge in lab safety procedures and we got familiarized with PCR, cloning and transformation.Before the workshop every team member had to complete a short safety quiz that allowed us to evaluate our knowledge.We do not know the implication the release of the modified moss could have on the natural ecosystem.Forward contamination is the contamination of a celestial object by organisms from earth that may have contaminated the spacecraft on the way to the object.Because GMOs are organisms that are not naturally encountered in the environment their release to the environment can form a safety issue.", "keywords": "constructed UMBC15project1 crystalline trans-zeatin angiostatin interdisciplinary specificity angiogenesis scientists applications",

the transmission to other bees to reduce losses.Q: Our project is to create a gene medicine that can inhibit viral replication and add E. coli bacteria to the syrup to feed bees.It will use bees\u0092 habits of feeding each other to achieve the effect of prevention and treatment of disease.Then we want to know whether the E. coli we add will have effects on honey quality and safety ?A: Actually, unprocessed honey contains various active microbes, such as yeast, E. coli and other bacteria.Do you have any ideas or suggestions for our two programs ?A:The program of import suicide gene in E. coli ,effect of suicide gene may not be as good as that in theory, in the end it may not effectively solve the security problems .So it remains to be confirmed,which you need to do experimental test .In addition, E. coli is not the dominant bacteria in honey, so basically you can not consider security issues.Q: If we made gene medicine products, compared with traditional chemical drugs in the market what are our competitive advantages?A: Your generic drugs can effectively treat CSBV and has small food safety risks to human as opposed to the traditional hazards of drugs on security issues.What is the traditional method we have to control this disease and what are the advantages of our technology?A:In early times this virus is very serious indeed, resulting in enormous loss of bees .Yeast program sounds good, but I did not study in this regard, I can not give you any advice.Q:Our idea is to make this technology into patents and product, we want to hear your views and suggestions on our industrial prospects of this technology.A:Now there is no direct treatment to the virus, if the RNA interference technology is successful, I think the outlook is still very good.One of the biggest problems is that we used E. coli to be the carrier, but we feared that these E. coli is a potential pathogen, resulting in intestinal infections and other diseases.Next we started the interview.Q:According to reports, the number of bees is now declining every year.But we do not know the accurate reasons for it.We would like to ask your views on this matter, as well as the impact on the apiculture in China?A:Yes, this problem is more serious in Europe and America.And we believe that in their future, the principle of playing will have a long-lasting effect in many aspects of their life.Professor Susong Kun:He was awarded Special Economic Animals (including Silkworm, Honeybees) PhD by Zhejiang University .Now he is the vice president of bee faculty in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University and he is Professor, doctoral tutor; positions bee scientist of modern industrial technology system , \"Minjiang scholar\" Professor; Deputy Secretary-General of China Institute of beekeeping, executive director of China Institute of beekeeping bee biology,deputy director of the professional Committee of three bee breeding, vice president and the Secretary-General of apiculture Zhejiang Association.These factors make China has not been a big impact.A:The reason for this problem is unknow , I think the reason is multifaceted and comprehensive.But now with the improvement of beekeeping technologies, as well as taking into account the impact of drugs on product quality .We seldom use the drugs.A: Because the disease first breaks out in the general body of the bee larvae but he impact on adult bees are relatively small.Such as environmental factors, electromagnetic, viruses, pesticides, etc., it is a common effect of these factors make reduction in the number of bees.While the population of Chinese bees is relatively small and product less honey.So people seldom farm them.These factors slowly caused the population of Italian bee rapidly expanding.However, the relative reduction was in Chinese bees population.To remove the barrier between science and normal people\u0092s life, It is our responsibility to lead people into the wonderland of science.But most important of all, we actually have a common philosophy\u0097\u0097Playing is the best way of learning.It began from April this year with high Infectiousness and spread fast and strong.This disease is so difficult to cure that it resulted in economic loss.A:If this disease outbroke more serious in the past , then they could only be used some illicit chemicals to combat, such as oxytetracycline.Oxytetracycline is the most widely used medicine in China for it\u0092s cheap and effective, but it can not be guaranteed that there will be no infection.Where a large number of use of pesticides will be a very important affecting factor.Q:We aim to cure Sacbrood disease which is caused by Chinese Sacbrood Virus.If it is put into the market, it will certainly have a incomparable advantages with other drugs.During the activity, we taught them everything we know about honeybees, and they did show a great interest in the small charming creature.We taught them the structure of honeybees and they were required to use a way they want to show us what they have learned.We aimed to inspire their interest in science, and make it clear that they all have a talent of doing science, for they all have a talent of playing and learning.Fanshu Park gave us a few training so that we know how to deal with kids, besides they helped us organized ten children and provided us an activity space and facilities needed.In 28th of August, we held an half-day activity.For this, we want to hear your views and suggestions?A:E.coli is indeed harmful and you also relates to a transgenic.So security of products in question must be paid attention to.Then we tried to spread the idea that everyone has the potential to be scientist as long as being offered an opportunity.And the discussion is, who cares?We successfully taught them the how to play correctly and scientifically by doing this way.After all, the honey will be marketed, and goes to public.This part may be a bit dull for kids, but when they were required to distinguish out real honey from fakes on their own, it seemed rather practical instead.To illustrate that everyone has a potential of being a scientist, or a engineer, we helped them to design their own project.Some kids tried to draw a picture of honeybee and some even tried to made a shape of honeybee by using plasticene.We also taught them the difference between real honey and fakes, so that in future they won\u0092t make a terrible purchase.Instead of giving a dull lesson about biology, this year FAFU-China decided to teach children how to play correctly, how to play with principles from science, and finally they will find their own way to science.We cooperated with a semi-profit social organization Fanshu Park.If we add rules to play, we have a game which is actually what project is.But beekeepers have trained that two boxes of bees from the perspective of disease resistance, thanks to resistance to disease, and that two boxes of bees now develop into hundreds of boxes.Then we told him about the project and the process of experiment.But before that there are several issues you need to address, the first one is the safety of the products , this was just been mentioned before.This technique is equivalent to cure from the root , more direct thorough.Q:In the experiment, we paid special attention to bio-safety issues.Second, the quality honey which is sterilized will decline.Most of these drugs are expensive but the effect is good, so it has become a choice for traditional beekeepers.So if you can effectively solve these problems, it will be promising.A: Nowadays most bees Chinese beekeepers raise are Italian bees.The final prices of product and costs are also important issues, if you can solve these problems, I think it will be a dramatic product in apiculture.Expectancy is what do you think the answer for the question would be.But you have to take into account the cost and the use of generic drugs.The reason may be the unique Chinese bees followed by domestic beekeeping long history and rich experience.Over the past 4 years, Fanshu Park has successfully explored a new field in Fuzhou city and organized a bunch of children and parents on it\u0092s back.The second one is the effect of the product, you must reach a certain level of effect.Part of the reason is that they are very experienced with holding activities for children.But for China, the problem is not that serious.But this time, we need some innovations, perhaps some funs too.Play is not only a simple process.Because now through artificial breeding, we have been able to reduce the harm caused by CSBV, so your products must have a better result.You\u0092ll know that play provides everything you need in oder to be a scientist, and that is what motivates us.First, because the honey itself contains a certain amount of lysozyme, it has a bactericidal effect.", "design": "This is the easiest way we design for the usage of our product.Next add 5ml bacterial suspension of engineered bacteria into the forage, limiting the density under 1CFU/ml, which is within the standard of food security.Then you have the complete product.Beekeepers who don t know anything about synthetic biology can use this product simply by directly feeding infected hives with the product.Now we have the easiest forage for honeybees.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Immediately, we began to do double enzyme digestion(EcoR1/Xho1?EcoR1/Pst1).After gel recovery, we linked our target fragments to relative vectors with T4 ligase, 4?, overnight.Meanwhile, we collected data about the index of the condition of swarms again, which was used to analyze the effect of dsRdRp by Excel later.Pinking the positive colonies, PCR detection, and then plasmid extraction.Since now, we will obverse the change of population of them, the mortality, and the number of sealed brood and collect data every weeks until we get the obvious result.Considering we have not gotten RdRp-pSB1C3 yet,we decided to link T7 RNAP gene to pSB1C3 first.Anyway we would do it again tomorrow.On the one hand, we still could not link RdRp with pSB1C3 so that there still nothing on the plate.According to the result, we found that dsRdRp made a remarkable influence on the replication of CSBV.It was used as engineering bacteria for expressing dsRdRp.Also, considering the biosecurity of E.coli, we decided use yeast as the final transformation target.The expression quantity of RdRp gene declined either, which meant that dsRdRp really could inhibit the replication of CSBV.Even though we were succeed in using dsRdRp expressed in proeukaryotic system to prevent and cure CSBV, we still had to take care of some problem we met.We wonder if it was because of the efficiency of ligase or anything.On the other hand,we prepared another competent cell,HT115,which included T7 RNAP gene in its genome.Although the concentration of the plasmid was a little bit lower, it was enough to do sequencing.Considering the lower fidelity of the enzyme used for T7 amplification before, we changed into a better one called KD Plus and restarted to PCR, linking and transformation.The third sequencing still showed nothing right.The good one was we successfully got recombinant plasmid RdRp-L4440 while the bad one was nothing grew on the plate with CmRR.Further more, we want to use CRISPR-Cas9 system to make RdRp gene inserted into the genome of E.coli.Another part, we began to prepare the larvae of Chinese honeybee which was offered by our institute of bees.We put dsRNAs into fodder of the larvae of the honeybee to feed them.But we did again and the result was satisfied at that time.Tomorrow we will ask our advisor for some solutions and do it one more time.After figuring out the problem, we eventually got the all right dsRNAs.So we decided to use dsRdRp to inference CSBV.We used cDNA of RdRp and specific primers(Not1-F/Pst1-R?EcoR1-F/Pst1-R) to synthesize RdRp gene.Today was the first day that we began our project in the lab after we made a scientific plan.It was encouraging!Today we made RT-PCR with four sets of reverse specific primers and the RNA of CSBV to synthesize homologous cDNA(CSBV Helicase?Protease?VP1 and RdRp respectively).As we all know, RNA is easy to be digested in the environment.We added engineering bacteria with expressed dsRdRp, which was divided into three groups with different concentrations(low?mediate and high), into the fodder of the infected swarms.It showed that the number of infected larvae which were fed with HT115-dsRdRp in mediate and high concentration was remarkably less than the control group.Other two figures were made out, which showed the effect of dsRdRp on the number of sealed brood and the population of a colony respectively.So we used specific primers(EcoR1-F/Pst1-R) to synthesize T7 RNAP gene by PCR.As usual, pinking the positive colonies, PCR and sequencing.Next, we would continue to collect more data until we draw the scientific conclusion.With the development of our project, we gradually have realized that even if using yeast can solve the problem of biosecurity, there are still other troubles, such as less expression of dsRdRp in yeast, easier to loss plasmids in yeast and harder to digest the cytoderm of yeast for Chinese honeybees.So we need a better plan to deal with these to make a more practical production.After AGE, it showed that the CSBV-carried rate of first and second filial generation was 30% and 20% respectively, which was obviously declined.We detected the expression quantity of CSBV in offspring by RT-qPCR.That was what we would consider deeply in future work.Today we decided to constract RdRp-pSB1C3 again, because we thought T7 RNAP-pSB1C3 may be not a new part any more.According to the result of AGE, dsRdRp had been expressed in HT115 successfully, even though its concentration was a little bit lower.Next few days we would detect the expression quantity of CSBV in offspring.We made the figure of the effect of dsRdRp on the number of sac-like larvae.Then after 12h, we fed them another fodder with CSBV extracting solution.Then we began to link RdRp with L4440 and pSB1C3 using T4 ligase, 4?, overnight.We did transformation.And T7 RNAP gene was amplified by PCR(EcoR1-F/Xho1-R).Today we used IPTG, which was divided into two groups with different concentrations(0.4mmol/ml?0.8mmol/ml), to induce the expression of dsRdRp in HT115 for 5h.So the transformation of RdRp-pSB1C3 could only be done tomorrow.Today there was two news.)We got the preliminary result of index of swarms.So far, we got the target fragments successfully.Firstly, we extracted the whole RNA of CSBV by Trizol.We had to change T4 into a faster ligase..As predicted, there was still nothing on the plate.We did transformation again.The second sequencing was completely failed because the sequencing company could not get any plasmid.Then we collected the bacteria to extract dsRdRp by CTAB.Eventually,we got the matching sample after using KD Plus.So we want to recombine another vector,T7 RNAP-pYES2.We transformed RdRp-L4440 into HT115,culturing in 37?.We found with the decreasing of CSBV.We stored them in -20?.Today we went to observe the condition of swarms, and it was

different concentrations can induce GFP expression efficiently and have little influence on the level of GFP We transformed GFP-pYES2 into the yeast and let the recombinant strain grow to mid-log phase in YEPD medium containing 2% glucose.As the diagram shown, we can find that GFP production sharply increases in 10h and a peak shows up in about 24h and then it decreases gradually.We added different homologous dsRNA of CSBV (dsHelicase, dsProtease, dsRdRp and dsVP1) into forage and fed to the infected larvae.The effect of different homologous dsRNA of CSBV to the expression of

concentration increases by about 23.68% and 30.10% after 21days.Compared with the control group, it is quite obvious that the infected larvae in medium concentration group and in high concentration group dropped dramatically by 91.44 percent and 94 87.91 percent after 14 days while the infected larvae in control group showed 65.82 percent increase after 7 days.According to the statistics we collected, infected larvae fed with dsRdRp have the highest pupation rate among all the experimental groups.In conclusion, we can find using 0.02% galactose to induce the expression of GFP in 24h is a reasonable and efficient way to get the most production of GFP protein.For the high concentration group alone, the growth of population had reached almost 60% in just 21 days.We fed the infected hives

creating or interfacing new modules that works with the platform can be easily done!Using our modules and software, the BIOBOT platform will allow the automation of many synthetic biology applications.Our platform and accessory modules are built from affordable off-the-shelf or 3D-printed parts, bringing the acquisition cost to a point where most laboratories can afford it.Re-inventing the lab: Development of a highly flexible, affordable and open source robotic automation platformAlmost everyone working or studying in biology have heard about liquid handlers and robots dedicated to biological sciences.1) The consumables used by these robots are expensive and can cost up to 10 times more than the usual consumables found in a laboratory, which is simply too pricey for most research groups to afford for day to day operations.Despite the fact that many know about them, and could potentially use them in their lab, very few scientists actually use automation.One of the main difficulties is getting access to one of these robots.5) Other problems like complicated not sufficiently flexible software tools (with costly updates) or the need to have dedicated personnel trained to run the robots discourage many potential users.Our team has developed an affordable, modular and open source robotic automation platform to address these problems.A second recombineering step could remove this cassette without any residual \u0093scar\u0094 sequence through a counterselection using the inducible toxin.To do so, a \u0093scarless\u0094 genome editing deletion system is being constructed using an inducible toxin and a double selectable marker (amilCP and KanR).3) Many lower throughput but still time-consuming and repetitive experiments cannot be performed by current robots because specific modules that support their automation are not available or too costly.", "design": "(Nature 2013)) were synthesized and joined to amilCP.The part was constructed using araC and PBAD

Mutalik et al.For more details about the construction of the parts, you may refer to the experiments sectionA RBS was selected through rational design and added with a primer to pVCR94 s toxin

part itself is a region of the resulting plasmid, from araC to bla.The part was constructed using a kanamycin resistance gene from the plasmid pOK12 (available commercially) and amilCP from BBa_K592009.Separately, we also joined a known iGEM part, BBa_K592009, that is amilCP with aph, a kanamycin resistance gene, and cloned those 2 genes (BBa_K1744001) in pSB1C3.(Nature 2013), amilCP, a chromoprotein isolated from Acropora millepora that was BioBrick adapted in E.coli by a previous IGEM team (see BBa_K592009) and KanR (Aph(3\u0092)-I (aminoglycoside3\u0092-phosphotransferase)) from pOK12 (it is a truncated version).We then took the part of the plasmid pBAD30-vcrx028 from araC to ampR (BBa_K1744000) and cloned it in pSB1C3.In practice, this part was built from two previously submitted parts of our team: BBa_K1744000 and BBa_K1744001.First of all, different toxin CDS were cloned (separately) in pBAD30 to obtain different kill switches.PLoS Genet 10(10), 2014Carraro N,

magnetic beads.Then, we used 1 \u00b5L of both PCR products to do a fusion PCR using kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-F1 and kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers).After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Although it is not tested, we are confident that the cassette should work at least as good as BBa_K1744000.To test the effect of the toxins on the cells containing the different kill swiches:2 ul of culture was used to inoculate 198 ul of LB-ampicillin-Glucose 5% or LB-ampicillin-arabinose 1%The OD[600] was measured at different intervals during 16-24 hours using a plate readerThe only medium used in this project was LB in broth and agar form.This is a problem on many levels: it\u0092s harder to get a clean PCR amplification, the recombineering efficiency and specificity is impaired with long cassette, there is some elements that can be changed or are unnecessary and ampicillin resistance is not a good positive selection marker since it allows satellite colonies to grow within an overnight time lapse due to antibiotic fast degradation.To build it, we used BBa_K1744000 as template in a PCR with the primers pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R1 to obtain a part of this plasmid that contains the kill switch without the resistance marker.Thus, the marker amilCP, with our promoter and RBS, can not be used as a positive marker in recombineering experiments, but it could serve us as a plasmidic marker to avoid plasmid background and only the gene aph3\u0092-I would serve us as a positive recombineering marker to help us select the good recombinants.To do so, we cannot use our newly constructed recombineering cassette because the toxin will not be able to counter select with a functional vcrx027(the anti-toxin) in the background.So, the pKD4 casette was amplified using vcrx028-KanR-del-F and vcrx028-KanR-del-R (see primer details in the design section).The cassette was then purified by SPRI with agencourt bead ratio 1:1 and digested with DpnI to get rid of plasmidic background.The primer used are lacZ-homology-ext-F and lacZ-homology-ext-R. Then, the cassette was integrated in the genome through recombineering using a pSIM6 containing BW25113 strain.The resulting cassette was then SPRIed using Agencourt beads and used in the recombineering experiment.The recombineering used again the same plasmid pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and arabinose at working concentration and incubated overnight.So, the method can be used, not only to purify DNA, but also to get rid of primers and non-specific bands that are often smaller than the band of interest.It turns out that if the good colonies are blue, or, if any blue colonies can be associated with a clear result (like plasmid background for example), it would be much easier to design an automated system in the BIOBOT to seek and pick only the right colonies for screening.This system will ultimately serve as the basics for automated recombineering using BIOBOT, even if we haven t had the time to actually do it with the robot because of the early deadlines.In order to test our BIOBOT platform (which could ultimately do automated MAGE experiment), a recombineering experiment has to be set-up.After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Firstly, by doing so, we will enable cyclic deletion using our cassette on pVCR94, which is the only plasmidic that we could do so beacause expresses the anti-toxin of vcrx028 which is vcrx027 and would resist to toxin induction.Those clones will be used for phenotypic test of each toxins.The different kill switches (pBAD30-[mosT;ccdB;mazF;vcrx028]) were tested (see here for the protocol) to investigate if they worked and to know which one was the best.The cells are heated up to denature it s proteins and lysate it so in the supernatant we get only the partially denatured DNA with denatured proteins.Mix 10 \u00b5L of dense culture (overnight is far more than sufficient) to 100 \u00b5L of Chelex (5%w/v in water)Incubate 10 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius (you can put your tube in the PCR to make a program that does both incubations for you)Transfers 50 \u00b5L of the supernatant in another microtube.The procedures are specified by the manufacturer, but here is how we do it:Design your primers to have at least 20 bp of homology on both sides for the adjacent part on your futur DNA construction.Using the part in that fashion, if the colonies would be blue, it would be plasmidic background and if they would be white, then they would be recombinants (since the expression of amilCP in single copy is not visible).This part contains a portion of BBa_K1744000 and the whole sequence of BBa_K1744001.Traditionally, the recombineering technique use an antibiotic resistance gene as a positive selection system.Basically, the DNA source of the transformation doesn\u0092t need to be pure for a chemical transformation and can be highly concentrated in salt.We decided to use Aph3\u0092-II, the resistance gene to kanamycin from pKD4, a commercially available plasmid that have the characteristic to have flanking FRT sequence at both sides of the Aph3\u0092-II gene.exo firstly degrades one of the two strands of a double stranded DNA fragment through its 5\u0092->3\u0092 exonuclease activity.We found that mosT and vcrx028 were the best counter-selectable markers (see here for the results)Our multi-copy plasmid results shown that mosT and vcrx028 were the best candidates for our system, but we needed to test them in single-integrated-copy for it to be more representative.Then the two purified products were used in a gibson assembly with the linearized pSB1C3 provided by the IGEM team to obtain the whole sequence of BBa_K1744002 in pSB1C3.To assess these concern, the cassette needs to be modified in order to be smaller, more efficient in PCR amplification and recombineering and easier to work with in screening assays.Even if adding this chromoprotein to the cassette makes it bigger it can still be worth it if the difference between negative and positive clones can become more visual.To build this part, we ordered a gBlock from IDT containing a P1U8 driven amilCP ORF.Secondly, the goal of this experiment is to test the recombineering in a relatable context.Therefore, we amplified cassettes containing all the needed elements of the kill switches from pBAD30-[mosT;vcrx028] (which are basically AraC with its promoter, inducible toxin with promoter and terminator and bla gene from pBAD30) with primers (killswitch_ins_LacZ_F and killswitch_ins_LacZ_R) adding homologies that allow lambda-red mediated recombination in the lacZ truncated gene of Escherichia coli BW25113.Again, one primer on two binded in the cassette and the other one binded in pVCR94.The primers (vcrx027-del-F and vcrx027-del-R) listed in  of the design section are used to amplify the cassette as described in the same section.You can see the result in vcrx027 clean deletion resultsOne major aspect not discussed in the previous sections about our cassette is that it is really big.The primer used for amplification of the cassette were pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-R.After the gibson, DNA was transformed using chemically competent cell into E. coli EC100 strain.To do so, primers described in the design sections were used on different template: pSXT, ptac-ccdb-cassette, gBlock_FG1, pVCR94.Then another PCR was done on BBa_K1744001 with the primers vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-F2 and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers) to get its whole sequence.The principle under this method is that chelex beads display chelator molecules that bind to the ions released by the cells that could inhibit PCR.The recipe for all PCR mix is as follow:The PCR mixes were all done on ice and we followed manufacturer\u0092s recommendation for denaturation and elongation temperature.For TFBI and TFBII composition, please refer to other reagents section.Dilute digestion samples 1:2 at least to get better DNA yield.Place your tube on a magnetic rack and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Once dry, resuspend the beads in molecular grade water in the volume needed for further experiments.Transfers your tube on the magnetic rack again and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Chelex DNA purification is a quick and cheap method for DNA purification.Unfortunately, we had problems amplifying the cassette in order to integrate it in the genome so we did not have the chance to test the cassette.See the results for the cassette insertion in pKD4 insertion result section.We can now test our cassette through vcrx027 deletion.The clones were confirmed by digestion and lyophilised for IGEM shipping.This part is the optimisation conclusion of the final deletion cassette.In each case, one of the two primer in internal to the pKD4 cassette and will only bind to pVCR94 if the pKD4 cassette was successfully integrated.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and glucose amounts.Since the kanamycin marker is no longer wanted in pVCR94 and is adjacent to the gene to delete, we will delete it as well.For schematique details on the resulting plasmid, please visit:The clones for each construction were screened by digestion (results not shown) and good clones for each constructions were obtained.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and arabinose amounts.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics amounts.The full protocol is available with the kit purchase.IMPORTANT NOTE: This technique can be affected by the buffer in which the DNA lies.Both come from BIOBASIC, their catalog numbers are SD7002(S518) and SD7003(S519).Here are the complete list of antibiotics used in this project with the working concentration for each:TFBI:30 mM KOAc, 100 mM RbCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MnCl2, 15 % glycerol, pH 5.8 (adjusted with acetic acid), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.TFBII:10 mM MOPS or PIPES, 75 mM CaCl2, 10 mM RbCl, 15 % glycerol, pH 6.5 (adjust with KOH), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.The polymerase used for all experiment was Veraseq from Enzymatics\u0099.They were used as described in the primer table in the design section.You can also see in the results that the colonies with BBa_K1744001 inserted in single copy in the genome were not really blue.All the tested clones for mosT shown that behavior, but only 1 of the 3 vcrx028 clones did.Those plasmid are thermosensible (the origin of replication do not work at 37 degrees Celsius) and the lambda red system is heat induced.See the protocol or See the resultsSince vcrx028 seems to work better than other toxins, we decide to use it in order to test a cyclic recombineering cassette using the as template.pVCR94 is a plasmid isolated during the 1994 cholerae outbreak in a Rwanda refugee camp.This part is basically just the previously described cassette, but transferred in pSB1C3 for IGEM shipping of the part.This comes from the fact that recombineering uses lambda red system.As the primer name says, the first pair screened the 5\u0092 end of the insertion and the second pair screened the 3\u0092 end section of the insertion.Furthermore, the longer the DNA molecule, the more affinity it will have for the beads because it carries more negative charge than smaller DNA fragments.After confirmation of the recombinants, they were tested and it shown that both killswitch were still working even in single copy.All of these primers are described in the primer table .The cassette basically contain an araC gene for repression, an arabinose inducible vcrx028 toxin and a resistance gene for ampicillin (bla), see the part description for full design information.As shown in the results, all the recombinants tested were good.We will firstly need to take out vcrx028 to take out vcrx027 with our cassette and make our cassette \u0093pop-out\u0094 with a fusion PCR of both adjacent regions.The first thing to do is to delete vcrx028 from pVCR94.That be said, we still have a working cassette with strong results to send to IGEM Headquarters as a part.Preliminary results will not be shown for they are not necessary to the comprehension of this section.To do so BBa_K1744001 was amplified using kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-F and kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-R. Then 1 \u00b5L of a 1/100 dilution of PCR product was used in a second round of PCR to enlarge the homologies to 80 bp approximately.All PCR except those specified in the text were made with 50 Celsius degrees as annealing temperature.The inserts and the vector were then mixed for Gibson experiment.It was designed to contain the advantages of both preceding parts : the working vcrx028 kill switch and the dual positive marker amilCP-aph.The results for the clean deletion was perfect.Than a polymerase will fill the sequence left empty by the exonuclease and a ligase will join both strands together.The DNA of those clones was then extracted using Chelex method and screened through PCR using 2 different pairs of primers.There is two major adds and changes to the protocol.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.It contains kanamycin resistance from pOK12 (a commercially available plasmid) which is a truncated, shorter version of Aph3\u0092-I and amilCP, a deep blue chromoprotein Biobrick standardised by a previous IGEM team from part BBa_K592009.In this section, we will detail the experiments leading to a fully working clean deletion system through recombineering.2015 for details, this version had the multiple resistance genes region deleted and replaced by Spectinomycin resistance).Those two fact explains the major changes in the protocol.The aspects of the colonies was indeed deep blue.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB ampicillin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.The plasmid used was still pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB ampicillin, streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and glucose at working concentration and incubated overnight.(2000) and uses three protein for the lambda phage: bet, gam, exo.It is now a well known technique that uses an exonuclease to degrade 5\u0092->3\u0092 one strand of DNA, permitting the homology regions to merge.The 3 \u0091 region was also amplified on the same distance with vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -R.Store at -80\u00b0C.When needed, cells can be thawed 15 minutes on ice before using them for transformationLet cells recuperate 1 hour at 37 degrees before plating them on the right selective plate.To execute this protocol, make sure you have access to an electroporator and be carefull handling the device, as its function is to give electric pulses.Furthermore, we know that recombineering works in pVCR94 since there are quite a few articles that have used this technique to modify its sequence (one of these is Carraro et al.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin and chloramphenicol.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx028-KanR-del-F with vcrx027-28-del-verif-R; and vcrx027-28-del-verif-F with vcrx028-KanR-del-R.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_R; and 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_R.You can use 1 \u00b5L for each PCR as template DNAThe DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx027-28-del-verif-F and vcrx027-28-del-verif-R.To do so, adjacent 5\u0092 region of vcrx027 was amplified on about 200 bp using vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -R.It uses Chelex beads (available commercially) and heat to extract poor quality DNA for PCR screening only.Our team is sorry about that, but since the cassette will be optimised, we have put more effort on actually improving the cassette than making it Biobrick proof.", "result": "For the right side of the gel, the same clones in the same order were screened for the 3\u0092 end of the insertion with a primer binding in the 5\u0092 of the inserted cassette.We kept clone # 3 for further experiments because it was the one with the lowest background of non-specific amplification.The above gel shows a representative success rate of BBa_K1744000.The result shown above demonstrate that the insertion had a 100% rate of success.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.The success rate of the method is, so far, of 100%.In order to assay the expression of amilCP in single copy, it was inserted through recombineering in lacZ gene in E. coli K-12 substr.The cells were photographed to show the difference between cells with the plasmidic form of amilCP gene and the inserted version of the gene:In this previous image, you can see the appearance of colonies on LB agar when they carry plasmidic or genomic amilCP-KanR cassette.But, with amilCP, the plasmidic background will be eliminated rapidly because the colonies will be deep blue instead of white therefore accelerating the screening and eliminating a good proportion of the background.You can see that only the control exhibits a different amplicon size, and that all clones have the sized band.The presence of a band in the red rectangle means the clone is good.We can see that after 10-12 hours, all the tested clones of mosT recombinants and 1 of the vcrx028 ones started growing even if arabinose was present.This was achieved through PCR screening as described in the experiment section.As it can be seen on the above gel, all of the clone exhibit the correct size band.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.In a recombineering experiment, the longest part if often the screening.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The only thing that is not good about this result is that there is non-specific amplification in all of the clones.The second primer pair (at right) produces a 1.7 kb band if kanR-amilCP was successfully inserted in the genome and a 1.2 kb band if it did not.Therefore, we conclude that vcrx028 is the most fitted counter-selectable marker for our clean deletion system.This section shows the results for pKD4\u0092s cassette insertion in pVCR94 and deletion of vcrx028.In the other hand, it would be unlikely that the predicted band could be non-specific because we screened with two primer pairs for confirmation.For the first series of amplification, the clones were tested for 5\u0092 end of the insertion, with a primer binding in the 3\u0092 of the cassette.It also shows that both mosT and vcrx028 are the most deadly among the tested toxins.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].As you can see, the expression of amilCP in single copy is not sufficient to make the colonies blue even faintly.As you can see, the success rate is really high.The clone order is the same on 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 screening.The first one (at left) produce a 875 bp amplicon if insertion of the part in the genome is successful but no bands if it failed.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].Therefore, no product should be visible if the cassette was not inserted at the right place.Thing is that we restarted the PCR verification multiple times but we could not get rid of the non-specific binding.", "safety": "Of course, like for mechanical tests, we had our glasses on, and, if required, when we were using a reflow-oven, using gloves to manipulate the PCB afterwards.All manipulations implying a living organism have been executed in a certified level 1 biosecurity laboratory.Here are some examples of the biggest safety concerns we had during our project.A standard procedure we followed when testing new mechanical assembly, for examples the platform motion system or the centrifuge plate spinning, we would always wear safety glasses.That way, risk to damage the equipment and ourselves were lower than to run a full speed test right away.When soldering our BananaBoard PCBs, to ensure our safety and proper assembly method, we always used suitable equipment located in a controlled environment.Also, to help detect problems and prevent it, we would start with a low speed test and doing faster tests as the previous was concluding.So, when testing new design for the first time, or trying new things with them, safety was a concern we needed to deal with.For our project, we design a lot of new electrical and mechanical systems.All

then modified the acid hydrolysis step of our polyphosphate assay by increasing the concentration of NaOH from 1M to 6M to decrease the extent of dilution during neutralisation.Polyphosphate can be used to generate ATP from ADP and in the case of phosphate shortage, the cell releases orthophosphate residues using the Exopolyphosphatase (PPX) enzyme which cleaves a residue at a time from

Polyphosphate-Accumulating Organisms (PAOs).The kit also contains a 10mM phosphate standard solution, which can be diluted to create a series of standards (protocol can be found on our wiki under

13.Genes that were on our cloning list were the Polyphosphate kinase 1, exopolyphosphatase, Phosphate-specific transporter and PhoE porin (we were unable to clone the latter two genes).We also had little succes cloning Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 s outer membrane porins involved in phosphate and polyphosphate uptake (OprP and OprO).The aim of the phosphate assay was to create a reliable method of determining the concentration of phosphate both inside of the cell and within the cell growth media.This assay showed concentrations similar to those calculated in the previous assay; however an observation was that as the volume of acid added increases, apart from peak at lower formic acid amounts, the concentration of phosphate recorded decreases.Figure 10 shows the amount of phosphate up taken from the media standardised using cell count (1.0 OD600 - 8x108 cells).Our hypothesis was that if the assay did not detect polyphosphate, we would have seen a significant decrease in the levels of phosphate detected when the glassmilk was used.From the results shown above in figure 8, we compared the amount of phosphate in the media of each sample.Graph showing the phosphate concentration within the cell lysate of 10^8, cells for 5 different ppk variants after 6 hours; ; ?ppk Ac SK12 - Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis SK-12 strain ppk variant, ?ppk Ac UW1- Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis UW-1 strain ppk variant, ?ppk Ac BA91- Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis BA-91 strain ppk variant, ? ppk is Escherichia coli with ppk knockout using kanamycin KEIO collection.We then decided to join forces with the growth assay team to analyse the phosphate concentration in the growth media of ?pstA, ?pstC, ?pstB, ?pstS, ?phoE, ?ppk, ?ppx and BW25113 using our phosphate assay kit.From these results, we proceeded to run a second assay using two strains of ?ppx (47A7,48A7) and two strains of ?ppk (5D10, 6D10), along with the parent strain BW25113.Results from the previous experiment found that the phosphate concentrations recorded were far lower when the acid hydrolysis step was incorporated (results not shown).This step was added because we suspected that the ABCAM kit detected phosphate ions but not polyphosphate as the assay was only developed for the detection of orthophosphate, as correspondence with ABCAM, stated that the assay had not been used before to detect polyphosphate.Figure 6: Results from phosphate assay using various volumes of 1M formic acid, neutralised with 6M NaOH before plating.For this we took the media concentration and grew our cells for six hours, after this we took samples of the media and the cell lysate and analysed their phosphate content.To carry this out we used 200uL per well of each sample and used the dye from the ABCAM kit to analyse the phosphate concentration in each sample.After receiving our constructs, we needed to test the amount of phosphate that they could uptake.We also present phosphate amounts within cell lysate using the protocol stated on our wiki in our protocol section (Figure 12 , Figure 14) Within our results, we tested all ppk variant constructs.Therefore we present the amount of phosphate present in the media (Figure 13).This therefore indicates that the chromogenic complex formed between the phosphate reagent dye and the orthophosphate is affected by the formic acid by a decrease in pH.This is contrary to our hypothesis that the concentration of phosphate would increase as the polyphosphate in the cells was hydrolysed.Following from this, we prepared an additional phosphate assay using BW25113, ?ppk and ?ppx using the formic acid hydrolysis at 0uL, 1uL and 5uL of formic acid and neutralising using 6M NaOH.In this assay, we used glassmilk to remove the polyphosphate from the cell lysate.However, if the assay did detect polyphosphate, the phosphate levels would have been roughly the same.We found there was no difference between the phosphate concentrations in the growth media of all cell types under test.This result may have been due to the acid addition and thus resulting in a decrease in pH, affecting the complex formed between the phosphate ions and dye.However we were unable to conduct the same experiment on other constructs due to the MOPS media not being detected by the phosphate assay.This was with the aim of monitoring the change in phosphate concentration in the media following cell growth.For this assay, we used the strains BW25113, ?ppk and ?ppx of the KEIO collection.Our next assay focussed on altering the polyphosphate assay by finding a way to hydrolyse the polyphosphate chains within our modified cells, without affecting the complex formed between the malachite green, ammonium molybdate and inorganic phosphate.This result therefore did not confirm our theory that the kit does not detect polyphosphate and therefore, in order to effectively test the ability of the kit to detect polyphosphate; we planned to use glassmilk solution as a filter in our samples to separate the polyphosphate from the rest of the lysate.Following sonication of the cell samples, we added 50uL of 1 moldm-3 formic acid to hydrolyse the chains of polyphosphate to orthophosphate.These two proteins provide the translocation pathway and the phosphate\u0092s uptake is energized by a homodimer of PstB (an ATP-ase protein that hydrolyses ATP).Figure 5: Phosphate assay using glassmilk.Error bars calculated using standard error of mean cellular phosphate concentrations of technical repeats.Error bars calculated using standard error of the mean.Error bars are calculated using standard error of the mean.In order to do this we decided to test the amount of phosphate up taken by a known amount of cells (figure 10).Phosphate ions can then be used for cellular metabolism which includes ATP formation from ADP and phosphate by the F-ATPase protein.BW25113 is the Escherichia coli strain used for the experiment.From our results we found that the most reliable results were gained using 108 cells.However, from the results shown below in figure 2, the acid hydrolysed the DNA resulting in no overlapping peaks.LB was tested however an issue arose where the sample was not diluted sufficiently and a precipitant formed (Figure 7).Graph showing the phosphate concentration of cell lysate of 10^8, cells for 5 different ppk variants and 1 ppx variant after 6 hours.Figure 3: Polyphosphate assay following hydrolysis of polyphosphate chains using varying volumes of 1M formic acid.Figure 4: Polyphosphate assay using varying volumes of formic acid and neutralising using 1M NaOH.We also found that phosphate within the cells can be detected and varied between different strains (Figure 1).As well as using glassmilk to determine cellular polyphosphate concentration, we planned to use NMR to create a spectrum showing two separate peaks for orthophosphate and polyphosphate, of which could have been used to calculate concentration.This was because the phosphate backbone in DNA produces a peak in 31P NMR which overlaps with the orthophosphate peak, making the spectrum difficult to analyse.Error bars show the standard error of the mean from concentrations calculated from technical repeats.Graph showing the phosphate concentration within the media for 5 different ppk variants and 1 ppx variant after 6 hours .As a starting point, we used an ABCAM colorimetric assay kit (ab65622) containing a phosphate reagent dye composed of malachite green and ammonium molybdate.A chromogenic complex is formed between the dye and the phosphate ion (PO43-), producing an intense absorption at around 650nm.This assay involved experimenting with the quantity of cells under test and the volume of sample used in each well.This might be due to the fact that cells were allowed to reach stationary phase induced by phosphate limitation.Preparing glassmilk solution involved using a fume hood located in the chemistry teaching labs and heating concentrated nitric acid almost to boiling; a 50% water to glassmilk slurry was made and stored at room temperature.Figure 4 shows a weak trend between increased formic acid volume and decreased phosphate concentration.For the latter, the substrate binding protein (PstS) of the Phosphate-specific ABC transporter (Pst) binds the phosphate ion.Image acquisition was performed using Carl Zeiss imaging software ZEN (black edition 2012).The pH of the washing buffer should be 7.0 as the DAPI stain does not react with the polyphosphate granules even at the slight variation of pH.Although this may show polyphosphate, this unidentified source could be due to nucleic acids being hydrolysed by the acid.Interaction of polyP with DAPI shifts the emission maxima of the dye from 456 nm emitting blue fluorescence to 526 nm emitting bright yellow- green fluorescence2,3,4.Micrographs of immunostained cell coagulates and tissue sections were captured withNikon Eclipse T300 inverted wide field microscope equipped with a plan apochromat 63x oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).Figure 10 and figure 11 show all three ppks from Candidatus Accumulibacter have shown to be significantly more efficient at collecting phosphate than wild type BW25113.Figure 7: Image of plate showing precipitant due to high phosphate concentrations indicated by arrows.Therefore volumes of 10uL, 15uL, 20uL and 100uL of sample were added to each well to determine best dilution for the ABCAM assay.We found that this addition revealed a source of phosphate which is different from 0 uL of formic acid added.A potential solution to a pH effect was to add 1M NaOH to neutralise the acid hydrolysed solution before adding the phosphate reagent dye.We then tested samples that had been subjected to the glassmilk as well as samples that had not.One way ANOVA was used and the result showed overall there was statistically significant different.Following from this, we ran an assay on three colonies of BW25113 using our pre-prepared glassmilk solution.Biological repeats of a BW25113 colony was used, each set of three repeats contained a different volume of 1M formic acid, ranging between 0uL and 100uL.", "design": "", "human_practice": "Here a few comments we received:This was an excellent opportunity for the team to gain insight into the publics perspective, particularly that of the older generation.Participants were then required to add strawberries and the extraction solution from the beaker into a zip lock bag.The third and final day of the event gave the students chance to see which team got the most growth depending on the conditions their bioreactor was place in.A discussion was set up with Prof. David Efird a senior lecturer of Philosophy at the University of York.A white suspension forms at the surface of the liquid, this is the DNA.Also we took the opportunity to advertise our project through posters and a video.Overall, the event was very positive and many people said it was great to hear a discussion about the issues of GM.Our team was keen on carrying out an educational workshop with local school students to engage them in science.We were given permission to use the venue to carry out a simple demonstration in which members of the public could isolate DNA from strawberries.We have been featured in the University of Yorks central online news,in student newspaper Nouse and online blog Mind the Horizon.The team took the advantage to talk to perspective biology students at the University of York s open days in June.A small group of our team visited a local primary school with the aim of leading a lesson based on the concept of \u0091good\u0092 and \u0091bad\u0092 bacteria.A round table discussion was set up for all recipients of the funding across the university to come speak to members of Santander s team.Our team has had various articles published to raise the profile of the contest and our project.Here we spoke of our project and the general focus of the iGEM competition.To further advertise the contest and our project we produced leaflets to be distributed at an event know as the Festival of Ideas.It became clear in the visit that many of the individuals had little scientific knowledge on the matter but associated the topic with many negative stories from the media.A talk titled \u0091The ethics of genetic modification\u0092 was organised to discuss the science and ethics behind GM along with introducing our project.10ml of 100% ethanol was measured and then added to the beaker.From this we saw that the number of members agreeing with GM increased but so did the number that disagreed.Many of our visitors discussed the topic of GM with us and kindly left comments at the end of the demonstration.The talk was then carried out to give the participants a better understanding on the topic.During this practical session the students were taught the importance of aseptic techniques in the laboratory setting.For the second day in the labs students were tasked with creating their own \u0091bioreactors\u0092 to grow their previously transformed cells.With this in mind we designed a segment to be apart of the newsletter that is sent to the Alumni.Our team was fortunate enough to receive funding from Santander Universities to help with the travel costs of getting to the Jamboree in Boston.We wanted to gain an insight into the effects of religious beliefs on people s attitudes to GMOs, which linked to part of our survey we set up.A quarter of teaspoon of salt was then added to the solution and gently mixed.", "modeling": "Using the iAF1260 model[1] of E. coli as a basis, we first attempted to look at the reactions controlled by the genes we had found as candidates for manipulation during the team s dry lab period.View OriginalThe FBA computer model looks for the most efficient, if not the most realistic, pathways to use, meaning it was difficult to force any amount of flux through the pathways we had created to accumulate phosphate.As phosphate is used in nearly every part of the cells metabolome, we felt it was important to determine how the accumulation of large amounts might affect the overall function of our organism.These include, Polyphosphate Kinase (PPK), Exopolyphosphatase (PPX), and the Phosphate Specific Transporters (Pst).FBA calculates estimates of the rates at which metabolites in an organism will pass through various reaction pathways.The outcomes of the model also point to potential further developments that are currently out of reach due to the iGEM timeframe, but would greatly develop our final product.One of the immediate problems we found is that phosphate is used by many different parts of the cell, and as such altering any one part has knock on effects on many others.Graph showing correlation between theoretical growth restriction and accumulation of polyphosphate.The results of our model allowed us to better direct the project towards the genes that would give us our desired result, and provide a good starting point for optimising the levels of gene expression.These rates increase in a linear way as further restrictions on growth are put in place, showing direct links between growth and our organisms ability to accumulate phosphate.Figure

shouldn t be too much separated.Pollution of our ecosystem by plastic waste is undoubtedly one of the major issues of the century.We added at the beginning and at the end of the cluster a non-coding nucleotide sequence for the purpose of PCR amplification of the correctly-assembled construct.The promoter as well as the terminator was put outside this combinatorial system to avoid the change of their position.The increasing production and use of plastic materials combined with the lack of interesting financial returns have just worsened the situation.By assigning 1 specific lox sequence to one cluster and placing the last self-recombining one between each cluster we are able to change the position of each gene inside it s cluster and shuffle the cluster within the operon.", "human_practice": "At the beginning of June, the team were approached by Juliette Raynal, a journalist from the magazine \"Industrie & Technologies\" to talk about the project of the iGEM Pasteur 2015 team.We showed them how to perform a Western Blot, and then we supervised the making of their own.After this little session, we taught them a bit about microscopes, how it works and how to use them.We were very pleased that they chose us and the Institut Pasteur to learn more about science !Eligo Bioscience was founded in May 2014 as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Rockefeller University based on the discoveries from the Marraffini and the Lu labs.We talked about our project after a wonderful presentation by \"Op\u00e9ration 7\u00e8me Continent\", a group of scientists and explorers that sail in the ocean to observe how plastic waste impacts our ecosystem.This event happened for us after a Skype conversation with the organizers.The Institut Pasteur is one of the host Research Centers of the Amgen Scholars Program.We went to the World\u0092s Ocean Day at the UNESCO, where we took part in the UNESCO Campus where a number of students discussed how we could change the way people think about Climate Change, and more specifically the way it affects the ocean.Furthermore, we participated together to the conference of Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, 2008 medicine Nobel Prize for her work in the identification of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the cause of AIDS.We also took part in a few scientific events, without being the organizers.We attended the Scientific and Technic Communication Patchwork meeting in a Parisian cafe where scientists, artists and journalists came to talk about opening the public to the main scientific issues of our time.At this event, the contestants, mostly PhD students and researchers, had to sum up a scientific subject in 3 minutes.We gave them a small lecture about the basics of Biology and Crystallography before taking them to the lab.The ECCO XXXIV, European Culture Collections as tools in research and biotechnology, is a yearly conference at the Institut Pasteur where scientists present their work.We were given the chance to present and promote our work on plastic pollution and synthetic biology.The \"Maison des oc\u00e9ans\" or \"Institut Oc\u00e9anographique\" offers each week a conference by professionals to the public.The problem of plastic pollution in the ocean also came up.Our team took part in different conferences, doing a presentation of the iGEM competition as well as of our project.Our team was presented with the possibility of presenting the PlastiCure project.Eligo\u0092s technology is based on CRISPR/Cas9, the trendy and invaluable

have to be very careful that the modified strain of E.coli does not leave the plant and ends up in the ecosystem.In normal conditions people would not be directly exposed to the bacteria.We also thought of the possibility of using our bacteria before the plastic ends up in the ecosystem, at recycling facilities.The plant would function as follows : the water containing micro- and macro-particles of plastic enters the plant and is put in a first container where the bacteria are located.In order to reduce the risk of leaks into the ecosystem, we would implement a filtration system.This would be the main issue with our project.At the French Meet-up in Bordeaux, the Paris_Saclay team advised us to use a compartment with two filters to be safer and to reduce the risk of contamination.We also plan to have a kill switch using an inducible promoter, so that the promoter will not function outside of our factory.We also thought about what we could do to reduce contamination risks if our projet would become real.One application of our project is to use our bacteria in small to medium enclosed industrial plants.The plastic is digested and the fluid moves on to the second compartment after filtration.We also used Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, another Biosafety Level 1 organism during our experiments.As mentioned in the final safety form submitted in August 28, 2015, we worked in a Biosafety Level 1 lab and we took all the required precautions.PlastiCure has been thought in a modular fashion in order to produce a broad diversity of products, as an incentive to the industry to promote plastic waste recovery.For this sentence not to become a reality for our project, we thought long and hard about biosafety.", "keywords": "anaphylaxis7

would be designed and the chassis chosen with biosafety in mind.We wanted to design a chassis that could be used as broadly as possible in iGEM, so we asked in our survey to iGEM teams which organism they chose as chassis.Thus, any alleged dissemination would be impossible.These mechanisms can be of several types, the most famous examples are the suicide genes (encoding RNAse, DNase) and/or the establishment of a nutrient dependency, where the selected nutrient does not exist in the external environment.We reviewed previous iGEM projects over the last decade and found that despite the crucial aspect of biosafety in synthetic biology and iGEM, especially for projects registered in \"Environment\" and \"Health / Medicine\" track, often no biosafety mechanism is designed, or even considered.Indeed, biological machines designed in the iGEM competition, and more generally in synthetic biology, do not exist in nature and can be randomly introduced into existing natural biomass through undesired cross interactions.This is why the scientific community is unanimous in saying that the \"biosafety mechanisms\" are essential and will ensure the neutralization of the living device created outside the laboratory conditions under which it was generated.Most laws, \"guidelines\" and associations related to the Biosafety agree in trying to prevent the spread of any living modified organism.First, we wanted to provide the iGEM community with a system able to prevent, or at least significantly reduce, the main risk: the spread of GEO.This system would include biological containment with parts that can be integrated in the genome of any Escherichia coli chassis and called SafetE.coli.This is clearly stipulated in the Cartagena protocol on Biosafety (international Convention on Biological Diversity): \"The Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential Risks Posed by living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting and from modern biotechnology\".Very often, the risks related to the safety of a genetically modified organism (GEO), except for a possible toxicity or pathogenicity of the organism, correspond to the spread of GEO.This reason is understandable given the complexity of the challenge of Biosafety.In this context, the 2015 iGEM Paris Saclay team decided to focus its project entirely on Biosafety.This may be due to a lack of time or resources on the part of teams preferring to focus on developing their basic idea by putting safety into the background.", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "Due to
