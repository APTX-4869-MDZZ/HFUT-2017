Yiming: Experiment design and a lot of bench-work.", "background": "", "description": "For the light system we selected light-switchable two-component systems as the signal input, and intended to rely on three commonly used ones: red, blue, and green [1].The software provides two operating modes: the E.coli-code mode is able to convert any given information into light-coded files, and therefore turn these files into actual light-exposure commands of the E-light hardware system.This year we the team Tsinghua 2015 attempt to store biological information into E. coli by combining the light system with the gene editing tools.Using this screening system, we can also determine the optimal distance between sgRNA pairs and length of the linker.With the assistance from the software, we can either convert a file into the binary data string which can be transformed to a light emitting pattern with a coding protocol (a pre-programmed grammar), in turn being encoded into the bacteria by a modified recombinase, or we can put in light parameters and encrypt the information into the bacteria.With the help from structural biology, we in the future might know how this system works in the end.With the help of the coding-plasmids from our CRISPR-Recombinase system, we can eventually store any information into the E.coli DNA and of course, extract the information later on through sequencing.The E-light 1.0 hardware system has 3 major components: the light-exposure & bacterial culture system, the controlling circuit and the computer interacting port.For the Cas9-recombinase system, we designed an iPTG-inducible ccdB screening system to test whether its gene editing ability is powerful or not.We took advantage of the high precision and programmability of light system and the specificity and the convenience from a Cas9-recombinase hybrid.Thus, combined with our light-switch, the user is able to gain better control over the bacteria\u0092s metabolism pathways.With this information storage platform in hand, what can we do in the future?The controlling circuit utilizes 3 AT89S52-24PU DIP-40 SCMs (single chip microcomputer) to execute programmed-controlling of the 24 tri-color LEDs, while the computer interacting port monitors the whole system through given protocol sequences.Green-light system do not represent none of two types of binary information, instead it acts as a license that allows the recombines to work [4].The E-code 1.0 software system aims to provide convenient commanding for users of the E-light hardware system.For the Cas9-recombinsae system we selected recombinase system as the tool to edit the gene due to its specificity for consensus sequences.Adding NOT and OR gates downstream the light system might render the system more complex and therefore available for better information storing capacity.We also would be able to develop better encoding algorithm to integrate more information into the bacterial genome and in a more versatile way.In order to build an information storage platform described above we devised a hardware assisted by a software that can eventually convert any form of profile into biological meaningful information.It is not hard to imagine a world where you can simply store any kind of digital information you want into the bacteria, and break the storing limitation of general electrical device.In order to utilize the light as an input signal, we have to first test its basic parameters which can be refer to.For example, we can denote the blue-light system to control information containing \u00930\u0094 whereas the red-light system to control information containing \u00931\u0094.With more delicate design and further investigation into this system, we can take our platform onto a whole new level.We adapted an engineering strategy onto these two component system by combining different modules and components from different species in order to achieve highest efficiency [2].We additionally built a model of the relationship between the light input and the protein expression output based on previous results.All being said, we still needed to first determine the basic parameter of this inducible system.Again, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out, turning out to be promising to ensure that inducible system can work successfully in E. coli.A straightforward strategy is to use light-switchable two-component system to directly control the gene-editing hybrid.We received quite convincing results to support that light-switchable two-component system can work successfully in E. coli.At present our system can theoretically encode and encrypt any form of file and convert their binary data stream into biological meaningful information, i.e.The light-exposure & bacterial culture system is based on a 24-well plate coupled with tri-color LEDs.We therefore complemented this system by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, because it is guided by a sgRNA pair that is not limited to specific sequences.Given the ideas come up with above, how can we put all parts together in order to store information within the E. coli?Using smaller Cas9 endonuclease is also a must when considering transforming the entire plasmid into the bacteria, which is actually a metabolic burden for the cell.[2] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].", "design": "The green-light system works an extremely similar way to that of the blue light system: it is comprised of two essential components, a light sensor and a response regulator.The red-light system used in our project consists of two components, a membrane-bound light sensor Cph8 and a response regulator OmpR [3].Light-switchable two-component system (TCS) is one example of how light signal can be wired into the metabolic pathway within the bacteria [3].Additionally, there are two components within: a light sensor and a response regulator, the former sensing the incoming light and responding to it by changing the conformation, the latter reacting to the sensor and turning on or off the gene expression due to its transcriptional factor nature.The principle behind light-switchable two-component system goes like this: When a beam of light hits on the bacteria, the effector module in the sensor, i.e., the HK domain, will change its confirmation accordingly, therefore its catalytic activity transits from a phosphokinase to a phosphatase.In this system, a J? chain is introduced to link the light sensor and effector together, of which the conformation change is induced, switching the YF1 (the fusion protein) from a kinase to a phosphatase.The blue-light-sensitive LOV domain in its soluble light sensor YF1 is derived from a protein termed YtvA from B. subtilis, whereas the histidine kinase domain derived from the protein FixL and the response regulator FixJ are found B. japonicum.As a result, a recombinase system is the most ideal candidate when looking for an information storing executor.Thus, the response regulator, FixJ, is dephosphorylated and deprived of the ability to drive FixK2-promotor-regulated gene expression [3].Since that there is an endogenous expression level of red-light system in E. coli, a bacterial knock-out technique is introduce to avoid a potentially confusing result [4].To be more specific, a light sensor is made up of two modules: an actual light sensor and an effector which possesses both kinase and phosphatase activity.As a result, RR cannot recognize its downstream target sequence and cannot activate the expression of the reporter gene.As is indicated by its nomenclature, this system is switchable \u0096 it has two interchangeable states when stimulated by different light conditions.With the advancement of gene editing technology, today CRISPR/Cas9 system has been exploited to carry out a myriad of functions, such as knock-out and knock-down of a certain gene, single molecule imaging, etc.It turns out that the inducible ccdB system works perfectly well, so it is competent to be used to screen the optimal distance between sgRNA pairs and an appropriate linker choice.Cas9, an endonuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes, can target and cleave specific DNA sequences that are next to the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) when provided with a guide RNA.Different light systems generally do not interfere with each other, and therefore can be stimulated and silenced in parallel [2].Here, however, the light sensor module is designated as Cyb, along with its histidine kinase, constituting the light sensor component CcaS.The light sensor is made up of a red-light-sensitive cyanobacterial phytochrome sensor module Phy derived from a protein called Cph1 from S. PCC 6803, and a histidine kinase domain from a protein called EnvZ from E. coli.Generally, two families of recombinase have been identified: the tyrosine recombinase and the serine recombinase [5].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].In this way, precise gene editing and information storing can be achieved by utilizing the light system to regulate the dCas9-recombinase hybrid.In addition, the inducible ccdB system has other potential future applications.That is to say, we still count on the specificity and accuracy of recombinase, but meanwhile we need the assistance from Cas9.We established a model of the inducible ccdB system indicating the relationship between iPTG addition and OD value after discussing parameters of iPTG, ccdB, relative concentration of bacteria, and OD value measured.After successfully constructing all the systems required and confirming its efficacy, we can bridge the light-switchable TCS and the dCas9-recombines system together.CRISPR-Cas9 system is a newly developed gene-editing tool that breaks the limit of specific recognition sites.Consequently it is regarded as a complementary DNA cutter that is not restricted to recognize unique sequences, but is versatile that can recognize any sequence within the genome guided by its sgRNA.This means that if current information storage capacity is not enough, we do not need to search for a new recombinase, instead changing the sgRNA pairs can solve the problem.Engineering Escherichia colito see light[J].Therefore, if we have to choose one form of signal as the input, the optical input is favored [1].A pair of sgRNAs targeting the sense and antisense strand of the DNA sequence guide the fusion protein to the location, and the recombinase part of the fusion protein carries out deletion or inversion of the DNA segment.The blue light system follows similar principles, containing two components as well.Of course, it is easy to understand why we then turn to Cas9 and see if it can overcome the specificity issue from recombinase issue [6].There are two commonly used gene-editing tools: site-specific recombinase and CRISPR-Cas9 system.Following the guidance of sgRNAs, Cas9 endonuclease can be used to modify any site of the genome conveniently.Along ccdB\u0092s sequence we designed 25 and 24 sgRNAs targeting each strand of the DNA.However, accurate deletion or inversion, a vital aspect to consider when devising an information storing platform, are hard to accomplish because of double-strand breaks introduced by Cas9 endonuclease.With this new tool we don\u0092t need to bother considering and introducing recognition sites of the recombinases anymore.Also, without causing double-strand breaks, gene editing can be safer and more accurate [6].In other words, a major drawback of this information-storing platform is that every time a new recombinase has to be used when increasing the storing capability.[1] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].The response regulator is derived from OmpR of which the recognition site is a promoter named OmpC.Site-specific recombinase is an endonuclease that is capable of inserting, deleting and inverting a DNA fragment within the recognition site.In our system, three mainstream light systems we took advantage of all follow this basic scheme.Second, easy access and low cost renders light system frequently used.Effects of different designs of linkers are also tested using this inducible ccdB system.We built an inducible ccdB screening system for it.Refactoring and optimization of light-switchable Escherichia coli two-component systems[J].The sensor and the effector interact closely in order to give a precise light-induced response.Recombinases were previously utilized to accomplish information storage in biological systems due to its specificity [7].Although the screening work wasn\u0092t finished, a linker choice and distance between two sgRNAs worked finely.Three types of TCS are now the most commonly investigated, including red, blue and green light system, named by at which wavelength the system is responsive.Addition of iPTG induces expression of ccdB and then bacteria get killed, but if ccdB gene is successfully disrupted by dCas9 recombinase, then the bacteria survive.[7] Yang L, Nielsen A A K, Fernandez-Rodriguez J, et al.", "human_practice": "In addition to our telling the story of iGEM and some previous interesting projects, we encouraged them to form several temporary teams, which enabled them to exchange their preliminary ideas relevant to feasible iGEM projects.The most impressive part came when the representative of every group shared the amazing thoughts of their discussion, and those brave students were awarded with small souvenirs.The public we targeted to were mainly consisted of three groups listed below: students from other iGEM teams, freshmen from the School of Life Science in Tsinghua this year and some high school students who showed great interest in our project and daily experiment.Freshmen major in Biology always look forward to their research life in the future with enormous passion every year.At last, we received many reflections and encouragements written on the leaflet from them, which made us feel even more hopeful when thinking about future iGEM teams representing the School of Life Science in Tsinghua.In the light of this statement, we held an iGEM Mini-Jamboree on September 13th, 2015.In this way, efficient and harmonious communication between teams was realized while we got helpful advice at the same time.We decided to create a chance for high school students to experience experiments in the lab after we got to know their desire for practical attempt based on theoretical knowledge learned in class.Contacted successfully on May 18th, these senior three students from RDFZ visited the lab on May 24th for the first time.Several days in May and June spent in the lab with them, we introduced significant lab safety rules and basic molecular experiments.Xiao Yangbo and Zhao Yiqing, two of our team members, attended

GFP, will be expressed when bacteria carrying this plasmid are provided with blue light.Add gradients of 0.1% iPTG to bacteria suspension.In this experiment, we used a recombinase system to insert a Kanamycin gene into the genomic region where we want to target and then utilized other recombinase to remove the Kanamycin gene.For the red light system, we transformed a plasmid containing the entire red light system (Cph8, HO1 and PcyA), along with a promoter, a terminator and an OmpR regulated reporter.Therefore, when bacteria carrying this gene are provided with the red light, the reporter cannot be synthesized.The result supported this prediction because we can observe a distinctive expression pattern between the treated (provided with red light) and untreated (kept in dark) group.Eventually, we successfully fused two proteins with the seamless cloning, as is supported by the appearance of 4-5kb bands in nearly all lanes.In addition, we added a roughly 36bp linker between the two in order to increase its flexibility.As can be seen in Figure 3, roughly 1kb bands appear nearly in every lane, supporting that our knock-out system was effective.In this experiment, we planned to fuse two proteins, a recombinase and a Cas9, together.(c) Measure OD600 value of each dilution of the suspension, using liquid LB as blank.", "safety": "Before we started our project, all of our team members had received lab safety training, including standard experimental protocols, disposal of waste, information on hazardous chemicals and proper use of biosafety cabinets etc.The risks to team members were minimized by wearing appropriate PPEs in the lab all the time and following lab safety regulations of Tsinghua University.In order to avoid that problem, all members in the team were instructed of how to distribute and utilize this gene with specific orientation.Since that ccdB is an inhibitor of DNA gyrase and therefore interferes with normal bacterial activity, any improper disposal of ccdB protein and plasmids containing ccdB gene will pose serious results to the natural bacterial communities.In addition, since that ccdB is not harmful for human beings, it is trustworthy and safe to use this protein to kill the bacteria.In one of our experimental design, a lethal protein ccdB was used to screen for successful dCas9-recombinase hybrid design.Therefore, it\u0092s reasonable to conclude that our hardware is harmless.The E. coli we involved in the whole project was lab safe strain DH5?.", "keywords": "chromoprotein encouraged references respiration

it is a new discovered protein inspired us to work with UnaG.As part of this iGEM project, research has been done on the newly discovered green fluorescent protein called UnaG.This is the first fluorescent protein to be found in a vertebrate species, giving it a range of biochemical properties that differs from proteins found in the original FP family - one of the most astounding ones being that fluorescence occurs only when a ligand binds non-covalently to the protein, namely bilirubin.Induction of fluorescence of UnaG by the addition of bilirubin.Instead of binding a fatty acid molecule, the ligand of UnaG is bilirubin, which binds non-covalently to the center of this \u00df barrel.During the summer we created three different UnaG biobricks; one with a hexahistidine tag suitable for affinity chromatography, one with the hexahistidine tag and a flexible linker of six amino acids suitable for fusing to other proteins, and lastly one biobrick with only the flexible linker attached to UnaG.This feature could make UnaG suitable as an inducible marker by the addition and removal of bilirubin to cells.In addition to the affinity tag, the original sequence was also modified to include C-terminal flexible linker (GSG)2 in case the protein would be part of a fusion construct.Secondly, it fluoresces only when a bilirubin molecule is bound non-covalently to the protein.The binding buffer for UnaG contains 10 mM imidazole, the washing buffer (to remove the excess protein from the column) contains 20 mM imidazole and the elution buffer contains 350 mM imidazole.This does not interfere with 3A assembly, but a variant of the BioBrick without the flexible linker also exists.IDT sequenced the entire pUCIDT-Amp vector including the ordered insert as part of their quality control workflow, so their results were used as a reference when doing modification to the plasmid.The IDT plasmid contains the lac-promoter so it is possible to do test expression directly with IPTG.UnaG has shown the ability of being fused to other proteins via a flexible linker both on the C terminus and the N terminus, making it suitable to use as a fusion marker.At each step of the experiments, sequencing was performed using the iGEM standard VF2 and VR verification primers to ensure CDS integrity and especially to avoid introduced frameshift mutations.In addition to mutagenesis experiments, small-scale expression tests were performed to verify that UnaG expresses under our laboratory conditions (Kumagai et.al (2013) purified and crystalized the protein from E.coli, so in theory it should be functional in prokaryotes).In the original paper (Kumagai et al., 2013) the authors obtained the UnaG sequence from a cDNA library of unagi eel muscle.The result of the degradation are two toxic compounds; carbon monoxide (CO) and the bilirubin, were as it is only the carbon monoxide that is possible for the body to excrete easily (Mugnoli et al.The pigment also has the ability to conjugate with three types of proteins that are involved in the transport and the metabolism of bilirubin in vivo (Bonnett et al.In addition, none of the fractions fluoresced when bilirubin was added.Since sequencing confirmed that there are no mutations, and we previously managed to obtain impure functioning UnaG during the small-scale experiments of UnaG, the conclusion was that the IPTG solution was faulty and did not manage to induce the T7 promoter driven UnaG expression.Moreover, unlike all other fluorescent proteins of today, UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, meaning that it can be used as a marker protein in research under hypoxic conditions.1976).Hyperbilirubinemia, also called Jaundice disease or icterus (www.mesh.kib.ki.se), occurs when either the formation of bilirubin glucuronides or the excretion of these does not work in the correct manner.After successfully obtaining UnaG assembled with a variety of promoters, mutagenesis was performed in order to create several variants of the BioBrick for future use.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0140972 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco) created by the enzymatic reaction of haemoglobin degradation.There is a slight blue shift in the fluorescence (UnaG is 498/527 nm ex/em and Chlopsid FPI and FPII 489/523 nm ex/em).These contains two glucuronic acids per bilirubin molecule and the compound seems to simply be an effect of bilirubin\u0092s three dimensional structure.One chain of glucuronic acid is enough to make the bilirubin excretable, but diglucoronides can also occur in the human bile.However due to the way the final product is created, the UnaG sequence had a 50% chance to be incorporated in reverse, which was the case.(I)Since UnaG was discovered fairly recently, no mutagenic variations of the protein have been developed with improved characteristics than those of wtUnaG.Consequently the concentration of bilirubin and glucuronic acid accumulates in the body (Buchan, 1826).After the column is equilibrated with ion binding buffer, the buffer it switched out with 0.3 M NiSO4 and a new equilibration step is made with 5 CV\u0092s of ion solution.According to Akiko Kumagai and his team, the quantum yield of holo-UnaG is 0.51 and it is stable in a pH ranging from 4 to 11 (I).UnaG does not seem to be present in any of the fractions 1-7.Afterwards 5 CV of wash buffer is pumped through to remove of all the excess protein still in the column.UnaG is a fluorescent protein that was recently discovered in eel muscle (Anguilla japonica).Since the glucoronic acid contains several COOH- and OH-groups the bilirubin conjugate becomes more hydrophilic than the bilirubin alone.The column is equilibrated with 5 CV of binding buffer, afterward 25 ml of the binding buffer is mixed with the UnaG lysate and loaded onto the column.The researchers suggest that this blue shift stems from the fact that the 57th amino acid in UnaG is asparagine, whereas Chlopsid FPI and FPII contain a histidine at this site.Bilirubin exists in all vertebrates and is a metabolite of the heme group in hemoglobin.Annotations: 2_3F - UnaG under a strong constitutive promoter BBa_K880005 + bilirubin1_5M - GFP under a medium constitutive promoter BBa_K608011 (control)RFP - pSB1C3

PBS - phosphate-buffered saline solution with lysozyme (control)bilirubin - 1mM bilirubin solution in DMSO (control)After observing the small-scale expression results, plans for large-scale purification were designed.All of the fractions were then tested for the target protein using SDS-PAGE.Common properties for these compounds, among which bilirubin is included, is that they can diffuse through biological membranes in the placenta, blood brain barrier and hepatocytes.After centrifugation at 4\u00b0C and 10 000 g for 1 hour, the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 \u00b5M pore filter and loaded to a Ni2+ affinity column, also called IMAC.Alignment of the DNA sequences of UnaG and the Chlopsid proteins show 54% homology.In fact, BR is the actual fluorophore of UnaG.This part has been designed for studying the properties of the protein in vivo, since the high positive charge of the affinity tag could interfere with its function or localization.Upstream of it lies a 6xHis affinity tag, separated by an additional Serine amino acid to increase flexibility between the tag and the protein.When BR binds to the cavity of the protein, it emits green light at 527 nm.Since the haemoglobin is located inside the red blood cells, the protein is hidden from the catabolism.Downstream of the part lies a short Glycine-rich flexible linker to minimize the effects of possible protein fusion.(2015) Adaptive Evolution of Eel Fluorescent Proteins from Fatty Acid Binding Proteins Produces Bright Fluorescence in the Marine Environment.This is part retains all the features, including the RFC25 prefix and suffix, but now the flexible linker is properly expressed and in case of fusing to another CDS would not cause premature termination.Finally, to avoid potential interference from the 6xHistidine affinity tag, BBa_K2003012 was created based on BBa_K2003011.After staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destaining, the band corresponding to UnaG\u0092s expected size (15.6 kDa) was not observed anywhere.The isolation and characterization of bilirubin diglucuronide, the major bilirubin conjugate in dog and human bile.These cool features, alongside the fact that it is always exciting to work with new discoveries, made us want to add this protein to the iGEM toolbox!The UnaG sequence itself was excised from the IDT plasmid using EcoRI and PstI and ligated into pSB1C3 backbone cut with the same set of enzymes.(I)UnaG is a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP).Thereby it becomes possible for the bilirubin to leave the liver and go along with the bile, through the kidneys and then finally get excreted with the urine.In this part, the six amino acids were removed (again through PCR), as well as the Serine linker in between.is almost never present (if so the molecule would have been directly polar and lipophilic) (Mugnoli et al.An exception is an NsiI site in the N-terminal 6xHis tag, but a BioBrick without it was also made.The human being\u00b4s survival is dependent on the monoglucuronides, but not on the diglucuronides (Gordon et al.This protein is interesting firstly because it is about half the size of other fluorescent proteins that are being used today, making it suitable as a fusion protein.In the registry it is annotated as BBa_K2003010.It is only when the exchange into new red blood cells takes its place that the haemoglobin becomes exposed and decomposed by either fagocytosis or haemolysis.1985).Bilirubin is naturally excreted in the liver by, with the help of enzymes, conjugating with the sugar glucoronic acid to create glucuronides.The structure of bilirubin.Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.The molecule has a tendency to form several derivate of bilirubin such as biliproteins, several conjugates and glucuronides etc (Harris, Kellermeyer, 1970).The results verify that UnaG does not fluoresce in absence of bilirubin.Afterwards the column had to be charged with Ni2+ this is done with a ion binding buffer (50 mM Na+CH3COO-, 300 mM NaCl, pH4).This discovery suggests possibilities of changing the emission wavelength of these proteins by mutagenesis comparableto what has been done on GFP for the past 40 years.They contribute to the transport of lipophilic compounds, often fatty acids.To avoid unspecific fluorescence, cell debris were pelleted before the experiment and small aliquots of the supernatant were added to 200 \u00b5L thin-walled PCR tubes.Figure 1.No other fluorescent protein has a ligand that binds non-covalently to it.Therefore suites of different BioBrick promoters were extracted from the 2016 distribution to test for expression.No indications that the diglucuronides are more biological efficient have been noticed so far.It originates from the muscle fibers of the Japanese Unagi eel Anguilla japonica.Even at the pH-values where the COOH-group is in an ionic state the formation of Figure 1C is predominant.In these forms the pigment creates several hydrogen bonds between the NH/O-groups and OH/-groups, which in turn makes the hydrophilic COOH- and NH-groups not available for polar interaction with their environment.The bilirubin molecules have a tendency to create different complexes with other proteins as well, such as serum albumin.Bilirubin does not exist naturally in lower classes of organisms such as bacteria and yeast, so it would have to be added exogenously when research is being done on these types of cells.Bilirubin can only bind to UnaG in its unconjugated (4Z,15Z) form, meaning that wild-type UnaG shows high specificity to this particular molecule.Comparison in different species of biliary bilirubin-IX? conjugates with the activities of hepatic and renal bilirubin-IX?-uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases.The Effect of pH on Green Fluorescent Protein: a Breef Review.The bilirubin is difficult to excrete since it is a non-polar compound and therefor not soluble in water (Fevery, J et al.High levels of bilirubin are toxic and it can result in neurologic harm that causes deafness, delayed development and cerebral pares (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco).UnaG is a \u00df barrel structure containing eleven \u00df strands - a typical quality for FABPs.Consequently the bilirubin becomes insoluble in water and methanol, but easy to dissolve in chloroform (Mugnoli et al.Chlopsid FPI and FPII are also bilirubin inducible.Note that this part is designed with RFC25 (Freiburg Standard) prefix and suffix in mind, hence it contains additional restriction sites, that do not affect normal 3A assembly but enable in-frame protein fusion without creating stop codons.is present when bilirubin is in liquid and solid constellations (Le Bas, Allegret, et al.Structure of bilirubin IX? (isopropylammonium salt) chloroform solvate, C33H34N4O62?.2C3H10N+.2CHCl3.Acta Crystallographica Section C Crystal Structure Communications,39(9), 1287-1291. doi:10.1107/S0108270183008252Karolinska institutet, https://mesh.kib.ki.se/term/D007567/jaundice-neonatal, Retreived 2016-08-11.Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco.Bilirubin is not very soluble in water, so the stock 1mM solution was prepared in DMSO instead.Breaking open the cells was performed using Qsonica Q700 titanium-tip sonicator since lysozyme has nearly the same size as UnaG and would make purification more difficult, as well as just slower and less efficient compared to sonication.Kumagai, A., Ando, R., Miyatake, H., Greimel, P., Kobayashi, T., Hirabayashi, Y., Shimogori, T., and Miyawaki, A.UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, making it suitable for research executed under anaerobic conditions where FPs are not functional.(III)(I) Kumagai, A. Ando, R. Miyatake, H. Greimel, P. Kobayashi, T. Hirabayashi, Y. Shimogori, T. Miyawaki, A.Those include a medium constitutive promoter (BBa_K608006), a strong constitutive promoter (BBa_K880005), IPTG inducible promoter (BBa_J04500), and a T7 promoter (BBa_K525998).", "design": "The feature area is where channels can be placed and is the part of the design which will actually be translated into a PDMS chip.The total running length of the heat shock channel is 2.276 cm and the part of the heating channel which runs parallel with the heat shock channel is 1.41 cm.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the electroporation chip.However there were still some problems with warping (about one out of four turned out to be good), so we went back to the drawing board to create our finalized design.The basic design is a box which is 2.2x3.3x2.5 cm.The heat shock channel itself is 300 \u00b5m wide at its thin part and 800 \u00b5m wide at the broader parts, it is 500 \u00b5m high in all parts.Early in the summer it was decided that we would primarily work toward creating a functional chip for heat shock, and if there was time to make a electroporation chip and design an incubation feature/chip.The running channels in the electroporation chip are 200 \u00b5m across and 100 \u00b5m high, while the \u0093channels\u0094 where the electrodes are supposed to be placed are 200x200 \u00b5m.The electroporation chip was designed, printed and assembled but there was not enough time to test the transformation capabilities of the design, mainly due to difficulties in getting the electroporation electrodes firmly and correctly attached to the chip.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the heat shock chip.A schematic view of the heat shock chip can be seen in Figure 2.The feature area is 1.6x3.0 cm on the finalized designs.The inlet channel for the cell suspension is 500 \u00b5m wide and 100 \u00b5m high.Size-wise, these were about 2/3rds of the chip in Fig.This design paradigm was quickly scrapped mainly due to the moulds (and therefore the chips) easily becoming warped during the curing process.The chip in Figure 1 is about 7x3 cm (slightly larger than a microscrope slide).Figure 1: Early design: Easily made and easily warped.Smaller, thicker rectangles.We went over several iterations of designs until we settled on the box designs.The resistor which we added is theorized to produce longer and larger droplets, since these scale with the length of the outlet channel.The total distance that the liquid travels inside the resistor is 103.4 mm or about 10 cm.", "human_practice": "To make an example this manual is made specifically for heat shock transformation, but the design of the chip can be altered to fit any other purpose.When we wrote the manual we wanted it to fit the needs of smaller laboratories that might lack all the necessary equipment and prior knowledge.As a part of Human Practices we decided to develop a manual for manufacturing a microfluidic chip for heat shock transformation.After a short discussion concerning intellegent property and the writing of a contract, our files containing the design of the chip, as well as the manual while it was under progress we re sent to them.The Biohackers at Makerspace are going to test our manual in practice in the near future and we look forward to see the results from our manual and manufacturing method being used.The manual covers the full manufacturing process for a microfluidic chip based on a 3D-printed mold.The collaboration with Makerspace gave us important feedback and lead to an overall improvement of the manual.", "modeling": "The flow rate of the inlets was set to a laminar inflow with average velocity of 10 cm/s and the outlets was set to open.The initial temperature of the whole chip was set 25\u00b0C and the initial value of the velocity field was set to 0 everywhere in the channels.Fig3: Simulation progress after 0.02, 3, 5 and 10 sThe results of modelling the heat shock system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.We decided to model our design for the electroporation chip so that we could test out different designs of the chip and view the effects of changing parameters such as flow rate and channels size.Modeling the heat distribution over time in the heat transformation chip circumventedthe technical problems of measuring the temperature inside the channel which proved to be very complicated due to the small dimensions of the channels and a lack of equipment.The main goal of the model was to determine if the structure we designed would be able to generate droplets with our intended values for the flow rate of a dispersible phase, an oil phase, and a continuous phase, cell solution.In our case, we were not able to measure the exact temperature of the cell channel inside our heat shock chip.To set up the simulation we choose time dependent study and the conjugated heat transfer interface which is used to simulate the coupling between heat transfer and fluid flow.That is, your actual values may not be exactly like those shown in the model but the model can give you a good picture of what is going on inside the chip.For the electroporation model we decided to focus on a liquid/liquid interface system as these are generally easier to model and drew the T-junction in COMSOL and assigned correct materials, PDMS, oil and water.The mesh is necessary because COMSOL uses the finite element method, a numerical approach where the problem is divided into smaller parts, \u0093elements\u0094, to calculate difficult partial differential equation systems.After generating the mesh the initial values and the boundary conditions of the problem was set.This means that higher flow rates require a finer mesh and smaller time step in order for the solver to converge.The results of modeling the electroporation system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.This is a good approximation for viscous fluids.The boundary of the chip to the surrounding was set to a constant temperature of 25\u00b0C andthe boundary condition of the two inlets was set to a constant temperature of 65\u00b0C to simulate a constant inflow of 65\u00b0C water.With the help of a COMSOL simulation, we could see the heat spreading in PDMS.A mesh was generated of the drawn chip using the inbuilt mesh generating feature with the parameters set to physics-controlled mesh and element size finer.For these reasons, models are a good method of acquiring knowledge about the details of your chip, especially the details that are difficult to measure.Finally an outlet was placed at the end of the main channel.One important aspect of designing the heat shock chip was to determine how heat dissipated in the chip.The initial flow rate for both phases was set to 0 as the two phases flow rate are defined under the inlet panel for each channel inlet.The heat equation of the fluid was coupled with the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow.The geometry of the model was built in COMSOL and the domains of the geometry was assigned material specific attributes from the library like heat capacity etc.We focused on modelling the T-junction where the continuous fluid acts on an orthogonal channel with incoming dispersible fluid, leading to droplet generation.In fig 4 the geometry of the t-junction is shown as seen in COMSOL with a blue line representing the initial liquid/liquid interface.Fig4: Geometry of t-junction with initial line liquid/liquid interfaceThe wetting conditions of the walls was set to no slip conditions.The boundary conditions was set to laminar inflow and the average velocity for the continuous phase: 100 nl/min and dispersible phase: 100 nl/min.Droplet formation is thought to occur as a combination of shear stress on the dispersible fluid and a pressure drop when the dispersible fluid droplet has almost filled the entire cross section of the channel.Lastly a \u0093coarser\u0094 mesh was generated with corner refinement around the edges where the orthogonal channel(dispersible phase channel) meets the main channel (continuous phase channel).This was important in order to know if the cells are actually being heat shocked, and at what temperature.By testing a virtual chip system we get both fast and detailed information that is helpful when deciding on the actual parameters of the physical chip.The entrance length can be calculated from the formula 4A/P were A is the cross sectional area of the channel and P the circumference.This method is accurate but also has a high computational cost making it ideal for microfluidics applications where the number of droplets needed to be tracked are few.Generally interface tracking uses a fixed mesh to calculate how the interface changes between two phases.Therefore depending on the interface type, gas/liquid or liquid/liquid, the final model had to be changed to meet the requirement for each type.This structure is critical as the size of the droplets and their flow rate after formation will determine how well the cells is being transformed.It uses the regular heat equation for the heat transfer in solids and the heat equation for fluids that accounts for energy transport due to flow, heat from pressure work and viscous effects that produce fluid heating.The properties for the surface tension was defined by a liquid/liquid system and the library value for the olive oil/water surface tension coefficient was used.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "As a proof of concept we did 2 rounds of experiments on our heat shock chip, one where we compared its transformation efficiency to that of regular heat shock transformation done off-chip and one where we compared transformation efficiency on the chip at different temperatures.During the summer we made over 30 chips and numerous successful heat shock transformations using only 8.4 ng of DNA and 5.9 ?L of competent cells.This waslikely due to the primitive and direct way cells were fed into and out of the chip (usinga syringe to push in/out cells and eye-measuring to see whether cells have entered thechip makes for inaccurate timing and a lot of back and forth).For each transformation at a set temperature the amount of formed colonies can be viewed in figure 3.The average (avg) number of colonies at each temperature drops slightly when going from 55 ?C, 65 ?C to 75 ?C since the latter two contain replicates with zero number of colonies.The avg value for the number of colonies at each temperature was used to determine the average transformation efficiency, represented by the cfu/\u00b5g value and is presented in Table 3.We found that the transformation efficiency was much higher in the conventional heat shock than on our chip.There was also very high variation in the transformation efficiency among the experiments done on on the chip(which were done using similar/identical reagents).Figure 3 shows the data points for the triplicates at each temperature having a large spread of the amount of formed colonies.That is, two transformations carried out on the chip in the same manner could yield a varying number of colonies.The cleanliness of our chip was good as little to no colonies grew on the plates with only SOB run through the chip nor on the plates with only cells (negative control).The plates with bacteria transformed on the chip showed many colonies, considering the small amount of cells and DNA that were plated.On a per plate basis the highest efficiency we had was123 000 and the lowest was 0 (8 out of 50 plates had 0 colonies), with the averageseveral potential causes which could cause this large variation of results.Variation could be due to human error.Here the raw data of every transformation is presented alongside the comparison transformations we did.According to the results presented in Table 1 and Table 2 the heat shock chipdid not reach higher efficiency than conventional methods, at least with the comparison metrics used.The crosses represent each replicate, the circle is a contamination check, and the rhombs are the average amount of colonies at each temperature.The highest average value for formed colonies was at 55 ?C for the heating fluid, giving 30 colonies whilst heat shocking at 65 ?C and 75 ?C yielded 21 and 14.7 colonies.In other words, the transformation worked on our chip and it greatly reduced the amount of reagents needed since colony growth was observed on plates were only 6mL of cell/DNA suspension was heat shocked.The setupof the chip involved running heated water from a beaker through the chip and thismeans that there can be a chance that there is higher or lower thermal leakage thanexpected, leading to the transformation efficiency being affected.55 ?C showed formed colonies for each of the three replicates.Figure 3.Mean transformation efficiencies of the different chips (1-3) and conventional transformations (0).Number of colonies formed after transformation at each temperature.Calculations of colony forming units per microliter DNA were made and the mean for each chip is shown in Figure 1.", "safety": "Besides following standard laboratory safety procedures (gloves, glasses, laboratory coat) we also did the majority of our work in a fume hood or in a \u0093clean corner\u0094.Still we maintained good lab etiquette and treated it with similar safety precaution as we did with E. coli.Acrylamide - The gel used for SDS-PAGE is made from an acrylamide solution.Cured PDMS is also non-toxic and does not have any specific flammability.Chloroform - Chloroform was used for cleaning PDMS, glass/plexiglass slides and the chip molds, especially directly after receiving the molds or directly after a curing of a new chip.To keep bottles of growth media sterile, we used gas burners on the bench.Since chloroform can melt vinyl gloves to the skin we used nitrile gloves when handling it.Whenever liquid nitrogen was used, we made sure to use safety goggles, insulating gloves and worked in a well ventilated area.Nickel Sepharose Fast Flow - Resin used for IMAC loaded with Ni2+ ions is flammable.During work with liquid PDMS we always worked in a fume hood, except when we put the mold inside the laboratory oven.Furthermore we always left all chemicals related to the creating and curing of the chips inside the fume hood, to prevent any gas leaks to the rest of the laboratory.CRISPR systems as Cas9 and CPF1 have the ability to digest DNA, making them a possible mutagen.As a final safety precaution we blasted our guide RNAs against the human genome before we synthesised them, choosing only sequences that had low or no homology.The gas burners were also used to sterilize loops for streaking bacteria and to sterilize glassware at the bench.We used the E. coli strains DH5?, MG1655, BL21(DE3).Even if non-pathogenic organisms are used, some of the reagents can be harmful for humans and the environment.Chief among these were ethanol and 2-propanol, but we also used chloroform during some parts of the summer.Since liquid nitrogen expands a lot when it boils, a special thermos has to be used to ensure that gaseous nitrogen can escape.Before starting the work in the lab, the whole team attended a safety demonstration regarding the lab and lab work.Gloves should always be worn when working with SYBR safe.Liquid nitrogen - We used liquid nitrogen to snap freeze our freshly made competent cells before placing them in a -70? freezer.It should always be handled in a fume hood using nitrile gloves.SYBR Safe - This compound is used to stain the DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis.It is however very unlikely to affect humans (or any eukaryote) as the protein would have to get into the nucleus.The booklet \u0093Common sense for laboratory work\u0094 by IBG, Uppsala University was available in the lab for quick referencing.However protective glasses, gloves and lab coat should always be worn since PDMS is very sticky and can easily stick to clothes or skin, where it is hard to remove and poses a moderate eye hazard.If CPF1 would end up in the cytoplasma, it would then have to be transported into the nuclei for it to be able to cut in the genome.That way, even if CPF1 was imported into our cells and then into the nucleus, it would have no nuclease activity.When possible we forwent the use of chloroform in favor of using 2-propanol or ethanol.During work with microfluidics we used some chemicals for cleaning PDMS, mold, plexiglass and glass slides prior to usage.A lab technician was available during the weeks for further support and questions.The protein would have to be transported over the cell membrane.Working in a lab involves many safety concerns.When handling the organisms, we wore lab coats and gloves when needed.While it is much less toxic and a less potent mutagen than Ethylium bromide, it is by no means completely safe to work with.Since not all team members had previously worked with bacteria or other microorganisms, the more experienced team members taught the others proper sterile technique and how to handle biological samples.", "keywords": "TAT-Apoptin antibiotics mechanical encryption calcitonin LC-Cutinase fusicoccin tetracycline controlled polystyrene", "track": "Hardware", "part_favorite": "",

on our Project Design and 3) Produce a more temperature stable form of oxytocin using E.coli and/or yeast: The third, and original goal, of our project was to directly address the short half-life and need for refrigeration of the life-saving drug oxytocin.Our next step was to order several shuttle vectors from AddGene so we could produce more of our part using E.coli, mini-prep it out, and transform it into yeast where it would express the proteins required for our oxytocin receptor to form on the cell s surface, and when oxytocin is detected, trigger the FUS-1 mating pathway and produce measureable green fluorescent protein.2) Create an oxytocin quality sensor using a G-protein coupled receptor in yeast: The second goal of our project was to design and test a diagnostic system for medication quality that leveraged G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in yeast.1) Design and build low-cost open source biotools: Denver, allowed our team to build many of the tools we use in the lab including a fluorimeter, an optical density sensor, a DNA concentration meter, an incubator, a refrigerated centrifuge, and a yeast dryer, which we will be exhibiting at the Jamboree expo as part of our \"Hardware\" track deliverables.We are working to improve upon their part by experimenting with different secretion tags to facilitate easier We are still working on this aspect of the project, researching possible mechanisms for producing the human oxytocin protein using yeast, and exploring possible temperature regulation mechanisms to mitigate the instability of this essential medication.In our work on this aspect of the project we experimented with different reporters, yeast promoters and terminators, yeast strains, and selection techniques.Our goal was to use the same GPCR approach to design yeast that could detect active oxytocin in order to determine if the medication sample was expired or not.The goal of the Lethbridge team was also to create a longer-lasting form of oxytocin by adding precursor molecules to slow the hormone s degradation.We therefore wanted to design a system where engineered yeast could be \"dried\" similar to the process for bakers and brewers yeast, shipped in inexpensive packets at room temperature, and reconstituted on site to preform the intended diagnostic funtion.We also used a four-button Olimex LCD screen, which required re-mapping functions to the four different buttons, and adding DNA concentration calculations to the code base.The fluorimeter and optical density sensor we built was based on a design by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team.We used 3A assembly to remove the composite part which included a yeast promoter, a RBS, our OXTR part, a terminator, and the FUS-1 and EGFP parts from TU-Delft.We relied on the DIY receptor design instructions created by oxytocin GPCR.We also requested a part iGEM HQ submitted by the Lethbridge Canada 2013 iGEM team .Different colored filters can be inserted interchangeably into the cuvette holder to filter different frequencies of light, and thus detect opitcal density or fluoresence or DNA concentration.We have begun work on this aspect of the project in several ways.We

liquid, and contributed to a lot of the yeast sticking to the sides of the column.To avoid this in future iterations, we would explore using higher velocity and hotter air in the heating manifold and the column.Cut two three-inch slits 10 inches apart in the middle of the 20\" cylinder (see image below) 2.Cut a small hole in the bottom of the liquid media bottle and epoxy a piece of tubing with the airgun attachment on the other end into the hole (let dry).Attach the vacuum hose attachment into the 10-inch slit with tape  3.We also insultated the column with space-blanket-like material to reduce the dried yeast powder from sticking to the We found that vast majority of the yeast powder was sticking to the inside of the column.Assemble the large square base using 8 of the 1-foot sections, 4 of the elbows, 3.We would also insert acrylic windows into the column so we could watch the activity inside the column during test runs.We found that the \"warm\" setting on high for the blow-dryer blowing into the vacuum attachment and high, hot setting on the heating manifold blow-dryer worked the best.Attach the 8\"-to-6\" reducer to the 14\"-to-8\" reducer and the 6\"-to-4\" reducer to the 8\"-to-6\" reducer.Place 45-degree street and regular fittings in the holes all pointing toward the airbrush tip inside the duct cap - use high temperature foil tape to the secure the fittings in place 4.Attach the bottle to the airgun and start spraying!Cut a hole into the cap of the 1-liter media bottle  6.Pictured below is a general design Liquid culture is piped through an atomizer at the top of the column.Hot air is simultaneously vented into the column, and a third inlet to column vents air to create a vortex inside.Note: We also tried to avoid static electricity buildup by grounding our column to the building.Attach the top square to the tops of the 4-foot pieces of PVC.", "human_practice": "The final deliverable of our project, the yeast dryer, was designed

of antibiotics, we are determined to implement micF to sense the existence of sulfamethoxazole and sulfadimethoxine in waterIn the circuit, micF and SoxS won t directly reporter fluorescence signal, instead, antibiotic substance sensing module, LuxI will be expressed directly for Bacteria II amplification, as known, quorum sensing is a system for stimulation(some signaling molecules called autoinducers) and response(receptor that will transcript certain genes) that is related to the bacterial concentration in the system.So, the mechanism and construction of CACCI can be divided into theChemotaxis Modification: to increase the bacterial mobility, modification based on E. coli chemotaxis related to the parts cheZ will be introduced into bacteria.Permeability Improvement: Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic circuit is very difficult.Chemotaxis consists of two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrates different behavior when the bacteria are exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial or harmful to their metabolism and reproduction.When absence of chemical, there is no molecules bind to the chemoreceptors, cheW, an intracellular protein, is associated with cheA and cheA will autophosphorylate itself and capture phosphate group from ATP.measure the nano distance, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface, the film we used isDuring our experiment , when elastic deformation--caused by the movement of the bacteria antibiotic concentration determination.Deformation caused by CACCI motility can be recognized with optical interference and the interference pattern recognition program inside NDM will analyze the deformation, thus antibiotic situation in sample canAntibiotics, or microbiotics, in narrow sense, are a various type of artificially constructed or naturally existing chemicals containing the capability of killing bacteria or inhibiting their growth, which are implemented widespread around the world.The overexpression of OprF in E. coli will drastically improve the antibiotic absorption capability, like antibiotic condensation occured in E. coli.Viroporins are similar to porins in which they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occurs between hydrophobic, transmembrane and alpha-helical domains of the proteins.SCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria.We hope one day, iGEM could not only share parts, but also share device, a nanomachine with mature functional system.Chemotaxis is a phenomenon of the movement of an organism, specific cells or bacteria, stimulated by chemical molecules.During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.In order to produce slight deformation on the polymer film, we need to find a proper material to make it.Then, bacteria will still swim but not tumble.Because of lack of natural chemoreceptors for antibiotics, we need to construct a genetic circuit specifically to sense antibiotics, and according to the mechanism of chemotaxis, we need to overexpress cheZ to improve its phosphorylation capability on cheY.The resulting interference pattern that application, the two paths may be of different lengths or include optical materialsCooperating with the optical part, the electric circuit part makes use of a CCD camera to take pictures of interference fringe, and then our software in the Raspberry-Pi analysesThis is our design of hardware part.Figure 3 : The design of our hardware, looing from outsideThe Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.The resulting interference pattern that application, the two paths may be of different lengths or include optical materials orBeam splitter combination, consists of three mirrors, a 50% reflection - 50% transmission beam splitter (50%(R)/50%(T) in brief), a 80% reflection - 20% transmission beam splitter(10%(R)/90%(T) in brief).Thus, we transmembrane protein, or more specifically porin, and inhibition of efflux system Previous research from Sahar Melamed and Shimshon Belkin has already selected dozens of promoters responding to antibiotic concentration specifically through the fluorescence able to sense tetracycline(26.5) and oxytetracycline(26.1) at relative high intense.Cas9, which is CRISPR Associated Protein 9 in brief, is an RNA-guding DNA endonuclease enzyme associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from Streptococcus pyogenes and other bacteria.To get more information on our adhesion assay, please refer to Results-Adhesion assayStrategy II: Covalent Adhesion between bacterial membrane and film with proper modification.To achieve covalently adhesion, we decided to implement the parts from 2014 iGEM TU_Eindhoven, and the whole system including these parts:DBCO-PEG4-NHS Ester (Dibenocyclooctyne-Polyethylene glycol-N-Hydroxysuccinimide), which covalently binding to polymer film.pAzF(p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine), a rare amino acid that would be implemented in bacterial transmembrane protein biosynthesis.In order to introduce pAzF into bacterial transmembrane protein, we need to mutate one of transmembrane protein, which is called COMPX.In order to make bacteria bind tightly, we provide two possible and promising solutions to figure it out, one of which is coating bacteria with polylysine(PLL) and the other is to chemically covalent bind between bacteria and polymer film.Polylysine refers to lysine homopolymers, whose precursor amino acid lysine is composed of two amino groups, one at the ?-carbon and one at the ?-carbon.Optical part is actually Michelson Interferometer, which can transform the shape change of a film into the change of interference fringe.In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene.In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene.Implementation of SCVE in ROSE may potentially improve the permatilibty of small molecules including antibiotics.Efflux system is a kind of mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic substances, microbiotics.According to previous researches, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic resistance, or multidrug resistance(MDR).The Young s Modulus of polypropylene is about 1.5Gpa, so it is selected as our candidate polymer film.Bacteria adhering to polymer film is one of the most important parts in CACCI.Implementation of SCVE in ROSE may potentially improve the permatilibty of small mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic According to previous research, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty.Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able in different situations for different molecules.Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.OprF represents one of the largest pore sizes on bacterial outer membranes, allowing diffusion of polysaccharides in a range of 2000 to 3000 Da.\"Breadboard\" is alsoThen let s see the screen , keyboard and mouse.Figure 7: screen , keyboard and mouse movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value.Theoretically, when elastic deformation--caused by the movement of the bacteria containing cheZ parts--occurred on the film, interference will be observed.Consequently, CACCI is also established with systematic permeability reconstruction to increase its capability on molecules absoprtion.Adhesion: According to our modeling, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface.Using Michelson Interferometer, the optical part, Spring transforms the shape change of CACCI s membrane into the change of interference fringe.As for bacteria, naturally, chemoreceptors were expressed on the bacteria membrane, which enables the bacteria to  sense  the existence of chemical molecule concentration in the surroundings.Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of smallOprF represents one of the largest pore sizes on bacterial outer membranes, allowing diffusion of polysaccharides in a range of 2000 to 3000 Da.The plasmid containing tRNA is as following: Figure 16:Schematic covalent interaction, this picture is extracted from guidebook of 2014 iGEM TU_EindhovenTo see more about constitution of our adhesion system, please refer to Notebook-Protocol-Adhesion PreparationOMPx is a integral outer membrane protein X from Escherichia coli, belonging to a family of highly conserved bacterial protein that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells.According to our modeling, see more in Modeling-Film Candidate, pressure caused by adhesive bacteria is about 10^-4 Pa. Consequently, the wavelength of laser about 650nm is able to detect um-scale deformation.Natually, CRISPR/Cas9 system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRISPR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms.In order to completely inhibit the major efflux system of E. coli in genetic level, CRISPR would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.Clutersted reularly interspacaed short palindromic repeats, abbreviated as CRISPR, are some fragements in prokayotic DNA with short repeats.And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9.And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9.Cas9, which is associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from * Streptococcus pyogenes* and other bacteria.CRISPR/Cas system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRISPR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms.Consequently, ROSE is established with both genetically amplified circuit andIn general, ROSE as a community, containing two kinds of bacteria, among which Bacteria I specifically receives antibiotic concentration information from antibiotic substance expression regulator by quorum sensing, whose information is provided with positive amplification for Bacteria II.Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the center of the beta barrel to interact with the aqueous channel.Porins are beta barrel proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able to diffuse.Nowadays, with proper modification, CRIPSR/Cas9 has become a common gene editing tool, being able to cut the target gene with gRNA design.When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depended on the structure of gRNA.CACCI depends on Spring.Actually, SPRING is a measurement system which is designed to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.In order to would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.The signaling signaling molecule will be produced in the cytoplasm using LuxI synthase enzyme and N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone begins diffusing back into cells or other bacteria, threshold concentration, about 10ug/mL.Consequently, we name our main body of device, SPRING, we hope with the assistance of our SPRING, we are able to share and enjoy those clean river, likeThe Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson.There was a time when antibiotics, alongAntibiotic substances containing several mechanism, rendering them to kill and inhibitOrdered formal course of treatment, these antibiotic would effectively treatgonorrhea,However, treating with microbiotics may be associated with a rang of side effects, from some mild including gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea to severe like hearing loss, kidney concentration utilization of antibiotics alter the host microbiota, especially theThe production of antibiotics in pharmaceutical companies explosively expanded these years.Besides, the discovery of NDM-1(New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase)Though, antimicrobial resistance can be transferred through evolutionary theory, main contribution of increasing antibiotic resistance comes from individuals  inappropriate antibiotics treatment, overuse of antibiotics without prescription from professionalDemonstrably, attribution of antibiotic resistance not only from clinically, but from agriculture and animal husbandry.As planned, OMPx will be mutated at residue 16, from glycine to p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine, zooming in the mutated site in orange:Consequently, the model of adhesion goes like this: modified bacteria containing special p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine transformed tRNA carry OMPx with mutated p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine site.In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (AKA plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term \"breadboard\" is commonly used to refer to these.It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance,which is to inhibit the function of efflux system.3.Package: In order to let everyone use the integrated improvement bacteria, CACCI in a more convenient way, we will provide CACCI in powder.Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic circuit.When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depends on the structure of gRNA.The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains physiologically improved of their cell bodies or genetically enhanced capacity of mutagenesis and geneBecause of such horizontal genetic exchange, nowadays, efficacy loss may attribute to the emergence of many antimicrobrial-resistent strains.The head of the drill can be replaced by many part such as saws or polish-head.Oh, all parts should be fixed with hot-melt adhesive (hot glue), in order to maintain stability.In farms or hospitals, solution containing ecological equilibrium of bactierial colonies and sidelong threaten public health.Because individuals neglecting antibiotic emission, rivers in China now encounter substances for human(48%) and animal(52%) in 2013, which is tenfold usage of USA and antibiotic substances in high concentration can be detected from many river basins that evaluation, antibiotics can be detected in all rivers in China in different degree.As figure-1 shows, the system SPRING includes Optical part, Hardware part and Software part.Finally, target gene such as LuxlCDABE will be engineer Bacteria I to release quorum sensing molecules to Bacteria II for exponentiallyTo achieve antibiotic concentration corresponding to AHL production, AHL produced by Bacteria I will be regulated by antibiotic substance sensing promoters.In general, bacteria tumble in the absence of chemical.When presence of chemicals, cheA is free from cheW interaction, and cheZ will efficiently remove phosphate group from cheY.He helps CACCI in three aspects, which are the optical aspect, the hardware aspect and the software aspect.Besides, these proteins as well play an important role in the resistance against attack by human complement system.As a result,It is notable that this second level amplification module won t directly expand the signal intensity, in another way, it will indirectly enlarge the resolution of different antibiotic concentration gradients.In NDM, there is a system for measurement: CACCI which contains chemotaxis modified bacterial adhered to a polymer membrane.The former one is regulated by Lux complex and produces cI inhibition protein and the latter one will be inhibited by cI protein and EGFP will be expressed when lack of cI protein.Consequently, this genetic amplification circuit, compare with others, will not directly enhance the intensity of GFP expression but toThe design intention on bacterial membrane permeability improvement is directly from part of mechanism of antibiotics resistance.For example, in E. coli, AcrAB efflux system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty.It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance, that is to inhibit the function of efflux system.The model is illustrated as following:Our CACCI construction is systematically not only including chemotaxis modification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.Theoretically, bacteria won t receive antibiotic substance because of mutation of its transmembrane protein and efflux system.Besides, using traditional genetically modified circuits to express report is still time-consuming, comparing with generalConsequently, we originally established CACCI based on chemotaxis and interference to make a larger level of antibiotic molecule detection, even a detection for other chemical molecules.Among these rivers, the Pearl River Basin in South China and Hai River Basin in North substances were discovered in these rivers, one of them, for example, in the Pearl River Basin, amoxicillin was found at 3384 ng/L and fluprofen at 2867 ng/L.Although, antibiotics in the river samples, its feature is also deficiency: that is such strong specificity may hurt extensive measurement.Artificial synthesis of sulfonamides, quinolones and oxazolidinones enrich theAs the matter of fact, microbiotics, the great saver of our life, is now putting us inEmergence of antimicrobial resistance is theoretically predictable by evolutionary potential.When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA.When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA.Plus considering cm squared film, we need the Young s Modulus of the film is less than 1GPa.(Attention: the LB liquid medium should contain glycerol which is used for cryopreservation.At last, the software analyses them and transmits the results to PC.However, facing that large scale contamination, complicated routine and trained personnel cannot be satisfied at all districts, so do it in many developing and undevelopedAlong with ROSE, CACCI embedded in SPRING will be used to detect antibiotic.These maximal induction of each promoter strain is tested in the course of 10h ofThe mechanism of these promoters are different from each other.Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments that is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief).Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments which is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief).This phenomenon is based on the interaction between the positively charged polymer and negatively charged cells or proteins.Since the discovery of penicillin by British biologists Alexander Flaming in 1929, the antibiotic family has been enlarged a lot.In China, the overuse of antibiotics for animal is the same serious as the clinical therapy.Spring s hardware, based on Raspberry\u0096Pi, allows spring to take photos or videos of the fringe.Though lack of standard ranking on antibiotic contamination, according to environmental scientistsNow, many technology including ELISA, Delvotest, HPLC-MS/MS, CE and Quantum Dot are able to detect antibiotic concentration in river sample, however much of their have muchNot portable, many big and automatic equipment are indispensable for concentrationComplicated Routine, which requires trained personnel to conduct experiment.The overexpression of OprF they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occursSCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria.CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transferThe Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson.Our theoretical modeling also illustrate a higherOur ROSE construction is systematically not only include quorum sensing and logic amplification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.This is achieved by \"shifting\" the signals between stages within the device one at a time.Later, phosphate will be transferred to cheY and the phosphorylated cheY associates with the flagella motors making flagellum rotates clockwise.During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to 3.MicF: An Antisense RNA Gene Involved in Response of Escherichia coli to GlobalTherefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with an optical interference path, recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.Based on a Raspberry-Pi, hardware part can take photos or videos of interference fringe, then our software analyses them or transmits to your PC.With treatment of IPTG, LuxR will be constitutively expressed to ensure LuxR-AHL complex willIn addition of signal amplification through quorum sensing, an artificial genetically engineered cascade magnification circuit is also implemented in ROSE construction.In this cascade signal circuit, LuxR-AHL complex trigger the activation of promoter Lux, then express cI derived from ? phage.As for E. coli, a gram-negative bacterium, whose surface is formed by lipopolysaccharides(LPP), which is negatively charged at physiological pH.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We hope kids can possess a memory about the mechanism in biological world and the seed sowed by us can prosper in the future.Finally, a panel session was beginning: This session is for students and adults to know iGEM, establishment and history of our team built in 2007 and the future of synthetic biology and biological technology.This is the beginning of our integrated human practice in April.Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and governance of antibiotics in China: This is a main human practice activity closely related to our project.They all hoped these incredible jobs would make more contribution to our human being, environment and the earth.In April 27th to 28th, a theme activity called Saving earth, saving water was established in University of Science and Technology of China.We saw their perfect work in necklaces, and we also enjoyed their smiles during the activity.After people had saw the tiny bacteria and DNA in a large scale, it was time for them to know about a latest track of biology\u0097synthetic biology, and iGEM, the most important platform for youths to know and develop syhbio.With the explanations by the leader of our team, kids began to know the basic principles of synthetic biology.We iGEM team, cooperating with Encoding Life Association (ELA), Natural Conservancy organized promotion and introduction to the public.At the beginning, our host briefly introduced the situation we human-being encountering in China.We hope our human practice would deliver the public fresh ideas on scientific researches as well as build a communication bridge between public need and the frontier of science.The first two things about biology coming up in people\u0092s minds must be bacteria and DNA.I do not know much about synthetic biology, I think it might undermine the law of natural evolution.USTC: Probably, ethics is a very important issue, let\u0092s take the X-Men for it, I think if there is a group of people with specific abilities in the world, maybe the order will be destroyed.As is often the case that the boss is out of sight, people can only notice the tiny part of the pollution while the primary is obscured\u0097because people can never believe that certain antibiotics, sulfamonomethoxine, for example, used on the animals in their plates can be a hundred times more than that on themselves.The data show that only 1% of people know the concrete condition, and the rest 99% of people are only guessing or even totally unaware of the consumption of antibiotics of China.So we can see that people know a little about the dangerous resistance via media, but their concept about this severe problem is still vague.In regard to the techniques to detect antibiotics in water, people seem to be blind, let alone the difficulties we meet in the specific detection of the types and the concentration of the antibiotics.They are not only curious about make their own genome necklace, but felt cool on the mechanism of DNA introduced by our members.Then, our team members briefly introduced iGEM and our projects to the audience.It is pretty good to share our gains and losses with them and enlighten the kids who are interested in science.Then, the leader held a small class for the kids: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for kids to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures.Nearly half of the people hold an optimistic attitude on the antibiotics residue in food and drinking water.When asked about the source of the pollution, more than 80% believe that the major blame of the antibiotics residual should be hospitals, but in fact, the usage on human is only 16%, while on veterinary, 84%.General biotechnology and previous iGEM projects on water cleaning are included in the lecture, as well as our draft ideas about nanomachines detecting trace antibiotics in water.USTC: That is actually molecular biology did not play a significant role in animal protection?sNC?I certainly believe that molecular biology and ecology are closely connected, but generally speaking, science develops focusing on the needs of society, for example, pharmaceuticals.The activity finally attracted hundreds of people joining us, which made such big contribution to evoke public cognition on water and other environmental issues.Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and administrating of antibioticsAntibiotics are widely used on both human and animal in order to defense the illness caused by bacteria.Saving water, a lecture for iGEM: An introduction of the situation of waste and contamination of water around the world nowadays to the public.Leader of USTC, Juntao Yu introduced the basic molecular biology mechanism and iGEM to high school students who were deeply intrigued in biology.The leader firstly introduced the daily laboratory apparatus to the kids and students such as centrifuge, vibrator, PCR Instrument, high pressure steam sterilization pot, incubator and etc.We still believe few can influence many with their constructive suggestions and going into action so that one day people in China, even all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.CineCom, movie community of University of Science and Technology of China, is interested in communication with our iGEM team.We tried our best to eliminate the gap between the fast developing science and puzzled people even if we finally managed to influence few.We hope our work will make a great contribution to letting more people know iGEM, synthetic biology, and believe the fact that we benefits a lot from genetic engineering technology already!It indicates that a number of people neglect the side effect that the abuse of antibiotics may cause.More than 95% of them know that antibiotics can cause antibiotics resistance.Thus, further publicity is needed.According to the last part of the questionnaire, although few of them have heard of synthetic biology, they are positive about biological techniques in detecting antibiotics.We gathered data about people\u0092s awareness of the issues of antibiotics contamination in China.In our human practice section, we combined general biology, molecular engineering and synthetic biology with public health, policies, art, movies, education, environment and society.In fact, the superheroes are human beings with specific features, perhaps one day, synthetic biology can realize the superhero story.So this is not an individual can decide, but will reach a uniform height in the future.sNC?For eco-propaganda, public misunderstanding about it is just like the one about genetic engineering.These are some applications of the techniques, but not science researches.And in 2013, China even consumed half of the antibiotics in the world.This year iGEM, along with ELA, delivered an integrated human practice (IHP) activities for the public.As for the species under the threats of human destruction, humans should not look for ways to protect them just to cover up their bad damage to them.We are surprised to know that children are aware of the word DNA, while they hardly understand the essence of it.CineCom: I think nowadays science fiction superhero plays the main theme of the majority of these movies because such script does not need too deep excavation, but only gorgeous special effects, which can gain substantial box office.Can we preserve the genomes of the extinct species and use them to culture new ones?We explained the mechanism of some of them and we were glad to see some middle school students caring about the working mechanism of centrifuge.In April 14th, we USTC iGEM along with our supervised Encoding Life Association (ELA) held a lecture on water cleaning technology based on common physical and chemical technology as well as some biological engineered technology.So we continued teaching them more about the physic theories in it.For the endangered species, if they cannot adapt to the natural changes, humans cannot help them, either.The abuse of antibiotics is the ringleader because it causes antibiotic resistance.CineCom: From the perspective of evolution, the evolution of our abilities is to meet the real needs.Maybe next time we could try on our epithelial cells!A lecture on general molecular biology, synthetic biology and iGEM was held in August.USTC: Yes, but haven\u0092t the superheroes started to tiring us?People judge things based on subjective preferences of decision, and therefore does not comply with the laws of nature.Nowadays, the unsupervised discharge of antibiotics arouses a big concern about their negative impacts on ecosystem and human health.For example, at paramecium stage, we can only engulf and divide; until the evolution of adult classes, we have the ability to build and engineer.We iGEM team established a club in our university called Encoding Life Association (ELA), especially for science education for children in China.Synthetic biology, a new method, promising it is, we believe it will have wonderful application in solving antibiotics pollution.This year, we continued developing our online account in Facebook and Weibo.Children wrote down their dreams on our broad, some of whom proudly promised that they would join in iGEM, were they admitted to university one day!In order to make our audience better enjoy these galleries, activities, we designed dozens of questions.This activity firstly sent fundamental knowledge and mechanism of DNA extraction for the attenders.sNC: With the reduction of wetlands, and the destruction of the habitats of the migratory birds, the birds are facing unprecedented pressure to survive, not only birds, many other species\u0092 extinction rate is higher than last century.USTC: Certainly.Since recently the public in China is concerned about GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) severely, we want to directly and briefly introduce to them the genetic engineering technology and let them judge whether the GMO is safe for our daily requires with our guidance.Now, we invited their leader Mr. ChungKim Whang.sNC: The main activities of natural conservancy of USTC are bird observing and cradling.Consequently, there is great necessity to make the crowd acknowledge of the proper usage of antibiotics.Isn t it fun and cool?Attempting to attract more contemporary and children on synthetic biology, we built an activity called Come and extract the genome of strawberries with our kitchen materials.Then they started extracting DNA from strawberries according to the protocol we had prepared.sNC?Molecular biological researches on genes provide us with a better reference of classification and explanations of the reasons for extinction from the microscopic point of view.Cross Talk: Now we are expanding our connection from the public to the professionals.Putting it into tiny bottles as the pendants of the necklaces.One of a sci-freak major in organic chemistry in USTC laughed in those following words,That was incredibly amazing!This survey is really important in the promotion of antibiotic pollution and antibiotic resistance.How fast do the birds extinct around the world?However, the improvement in medical conditions extend humans life span and promote humans well-being.So there are lots of collaborations in the progress of filming and screening.For example, the black hole in Interstellar and the theory of clone in Orphan Black?I think this is precisely the potential threat of the \"super heroes\".According to our project, we held a water saving activity and launch a questionnaire survey.But only very few of them care and get to know about whether the pollution of antibiotics approaches to our environment and our daily life.We do not pay enough attention to the treatment of animals suffering from the disease, because generally it seems to follow the laws of nature, sick and old animals should be eaten by predators, so that evolution goes forward.Many people said, taking part in this activity made them better and deeper understand the magnificent work that synthetic biology could achieve.During this lecture, our team member introduced some intriguing methods that provided by previous iGEM teams, including genetically modified phytoremediation of TU-Munich 2013 iGEM team and biological replacement of heavy metal ion contamination in water.A brief introduction of iGEM: A general introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology lecture for high school students.We usually start from the child, giving lectures in primary schools.And we found those children quite imaginative on synbio, neural science and molecular biology.Our simple interpretation on our chemotaxis and interference approach is so fascinating that many adults strongly changed their perspective on genetically engineered bacteria and molecular biology.So, we provided the opportunities for people, especially kids, to get access to megascopic bacteria and DNA, which are usually invisible, just as they are called as microorganism and molecules.", "modeling": "Consider in a current area S, the density of bacteria on surface is ?, and during a interval dt, the change of bacteria density is d?(Sdsigma =K_{a}\times (1-frac{sigma }{sigma _{0}})\times dN-K_{d}\times Ssigma dt)Where Ka is the adhesive rate of each hit, Kd is the drop rate of the adhered bacteria.Then, after solving this Ordinary Differentiate Equation, ODE, we got the equation shown below,(sigma (t)=frac{K_{a}CV_{z}sigma _{0}}{KCV_{z}+K_{a}sigma _{0}}\times (1-e^{-frac{K_{a}CV_{z}+K_{d}sigma _{0}}{sigma _{0}}\times t}))According to this result, the density of bacteria at time t is related to adhesive rate of bacteria Ka, concentration of bacteria c and velocity of bacteria Vz.And we can let (frac{K_{a}CV_{z}}{K_{d}sigma _{0}+K_{a}CV_{z}}) equals an integrative constant, K. In addition, we cannot start recording the image data the moment we put the bacteria on the cover glass in reality, so there should be a time delay in our modeling.Also give some irreplaceable constructive opinions and key indicators on the operation of detecting the concentration of antibiotics.Vz: Average swiming speed component in the z axis, which is perpendicular to S.(m/s)and irrespective of contacting with each other when swimming, we are able to conclude bacterial movement is free.(V_{z}=int_{0}^{frac{pi }{2}}V\times cos\theta \times frac{dS}{S}=int_{0}^{frac{pi }{2}}frac{V}{2}cos\theta sin\theta d\theta =frac{V}{4})Consider during the interval dt, in area dS, there are dN bacteria in tiny volume (dS \times V_{z}dt) hitting the wall whose area is S. Schematic image illustrates the process mentioned above,Because the number of bacteria in solution is much more larger than it on the glass surface whose area is S. So the concentration of bacteria (C) can be regarded as steady during the measurement period.Assuming the number of hitting wall bacteria is stable, the surface can only adhere one layer of bacteria, that is the place which has already adhered bacteria can not stick any more bacteria.Results are delivered below:It is interesting that we could know the \"Initiation moment\" through our data analysis, which is very cool.Another intriguing and important property we got through our data analysis is the adhesion ability(Bacteria to Cover Glass)(AA-B-CS in brief).According to the fitting results and modeling equation, the derivative of the fitting function at the beginning(t0) is the bacteria number growth rate in its maximum.Assuming the rate of stick (P) is constant, the movement percentage of bacteria will present in an exponential form changing through time.According to the fitting results shown above and equations, we could get some useful information when operating NDM, such as,Because we can not start recording the image data the moment we put the bacteria solution on the cover glass, so there is a starting time delay in the equation.After solving these equations above, we ultimately get the Young modulus of material required G <1GPa in order to get ~um order deformation.Therefore, we selected several materials as possible films: low pressure polyethylene, rubbers, and glass as our material of the film.Just think about it, if every bacteria pull together, we can detect the deformation even the film is made of steel and even bigger than steel.This part introduces the data of adhesion experiment, makes exploration and interpretation on bacteria adhesion dynamics.According to the simulation result, when  m  reach 95% of its maximum or minimum value(frac{K}{K+k}), t~100s.Consequently, we recommend user to get the results in NDM, you should wait approximately 100s after putting film into optical path.This part explains the fundamental principle of our detecting method - interference.This explains why we emphasize both bacteria and film material when we defined this parameter.Note: The bacteria solution in  HCB1-PLL(+)-0  sample was not the same with other samples, so the AA-B-CS value is much different with other s.Surprisingly, we found that the concentration of antibiotics doesn t effect the AA-B-CS in our assay, which suggests that we are able to use the same type of bacteria treated with antibiotic in different concentrations, which is another important theoretical base of our NDM.Through the pre-test and data in paper, we use 20ug/ml poly-L-lysine coating the film over 4 hours or overnight at the temperature 4? eventualy.Because the motility of bacteria will decrease when we do not administrate antibiotics.We got the best interaction time is the moment when the number of movement bacteria reach the maximum value.Thus we highly recommend the Bacteria-film intraction time(Ti) is approximately 100s after treating with bacteria solution, which means since you inoculate the bacteria about 100s, you should put the film into your sample solution and determine its antibiotics concentration.In test \"PAO1-PLL-0\", the bacteria solution was culture overnight in 37?(which means the bacteria was in platform stage).One thing need to know is that the different clip we implement in our pre-experiment will get different fringes.In the pre-experiment1 (you can read protocol of our pre-experiment in annex showed below).In the pre-experiment2 (you can read protocol of our pre-experiment in annex showed below).As the deformation range(h) is much more smaller than the radius(r) of the film (h<<r),Because the area of CCD camera is relatively small, whose size is ~cm x cm, the interference pattern is approximately paraxial spherical as well.Ideally, light path sketch should be as follows.Thus we got the accurate equation depicting the density of bacteria time t as,(sigma (t)=Ksigma _{0}\times (1-e^{-frac{K_{a}CV_{z}}{Ksigma _{0}}\times (t-t_{0})}))In order to fit the data conveniently, we change the equation form into a more general one,This program is used to calculate the amount of bacteria and get the percentage of moving bacteria, which is essential for our further research.As the deformation range(h) is much more smaller than the radius(r) of the film(h<where f is the resultant force of the bacteria, F is the tensile force in the film, h is the deformation distance, r is the radius of the film,?r is the variation of the radius, which is r, d is the thickness of the film, G is the Young Modulus.The thickness(d) of film is 0.16mm.Then, we are able to get Young Modulus, a critical physical parameters to depicting the characteristic of film candidates.Assume that 1% of bacteria are push ahead statistically, then the additional pressure given by bacteria is (Delta P=0.01 \times sigma F_{0}).Assume the radius of film is r, deformation range equals h.The film is subject to several forces acting, including force f given by bacteria and tensile force F through the film.Let s get some approximation on this model.Assume the driving force of the movement of single bacteria is (F_{0}) in horizontal plain.Where f1 means the resistant force bacteria containing in water solution, k is a constant called drag coefficient at this conditions.Besides, in the gravitational field, if we consider bacteria dragged by gravity in solution, then the static equation is revised as below, Where rho represents the density of solution, V indicates the extra volume of liquid immersed with bacteria, g means the acceleration of gravity.Then, in accordance with the data in previous research, the speed of bacterial movement(((V_{1}))) is approximately ~10(mu m)/s, while the speed of bacterial sedimentation(((V_{2}))) ~(mu m)/s.And considering the size of single bacterium, assume bacteria as cylinder, whose diameter equals 0.5um and length is 1~3(mu m).This part starts with the bacteria movement ability, analyze the interaction between bacteria and the special film, and obtain the requests of the material properties eventually.The interaction between bacteria and film is essential for our work.(Light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film).However, in reality, because the virtual image of holophote and the film can not be set strict parallel in actual situation, the light path sketch becomes like below, where light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film.We could use the method of coordinate transformation to simplify them as follows, where light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film.where r is the radius of the film, h is the deformation length of the film, a is the length of each side of the CCD camera, ? is the slip angle between the film and the holophote which we estimate.Using these parameters, we simulated the interference fringes image as following,How amazing our model is !More details on our coding using Matlab please refer to 2015 USTC in Github.Calculate a self-adapting or special threshold value in the image binay progress.Now we got the theoretical bacteria density variation formula and an efficient program to demonstrate the real number of bacteria on film.Simulational result just hit the row image we got before!Consider the reflect surface was not strictly parallel with the CCD, and the angle between the surface and x/y axis is ?/?.So we can know the optical path differences and light intensity distribution on CCD areUse matlab to simulate the interference pattern, and the result showed as following, When bacteria pushing the film and making film deform, the angle between film and axis will change.diluted bacteria solution 50 times.If we want to observe the deformation of the film, the bacterial additional pressure on film should reach a stable stage.Solving these equations, we are able to get Young Modulus, a critical physical parameters to depicting the characteristic of film candidates.The film is shown in black edge and the clip that used to fix the film presents in green edge.Through the modeling of bacteria adhesion, we can get some characteristics important but difficult to directly measure on bacteria adhesion and reaction to antibiotics.Calculating with all data, consequently, we concluded that driving force of bacteria is (10^{-13} N) by solving the equations.Firstly, let s check the geometric size of our special film I.So we defined this derivative value as the adhesion ability of the bacteria solution to cover glass, or call it AA-B-CS for short.This equation told us AA-B-CS relates to Ka, the adhesion rate of bacteria on every hit, C, the concentration of bacteria solution, Vz, the average swim speed of the bacteria.Because of the same interaction between solution and bacteria, in gravitational field, bacteria share the same k with the horizontal movement constant.Assume the motor ability of each bacteria does not change.The thickness(d) of film is 0.1mm.Assume the numerical density(?) of bacteria is ~(1000 /mm^{2}), which means a single bacteria occupying the area of approximately ~100 (sim 100 mu m^2).The wavelength of laser we used is 650nm.The film I is a circle with the radius(r) of 2cm.Give a method to process the interference image and calculate the deformation of the film in a high precision.Our experiment is initiated from interference fringes pattern formed naturally.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "The more fluorescence intensity we got, the more permeable theHere s our results, the first picture illustrate the total fluorescence intensity to 335nm and emission wavelength range is 370nm to 410nm, which is recommended by other hand, the fluorescence intensity in E. coli BL21 with T7-OprF (BBa_K1593210) and E. are respectively 207322 and 151820, which are significantly larger than the wildtypeThough we have already got the exact data on NPN uptake, we still need to revise

relatively low optical density as its OD600 after 9 h is 2.3 compared to the wildtype.Besides, owing to the existence of ?-galactosidase in bacteria, a more intense optical density we detected, that means there are more ONPG uptaked by bacteria.Consequently, using this feature, we are able to characterize bacteria permeability by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the bacteria solution.Based on these, we know that the concentrationsFrom this figure, we can see a rising trend in all bacterial solutions.We can infer that the absorbtion of modified bacteria is higher than the wildThere is a more visual figure for comparing the absorbtions.These two Figure 5: Extraction of gRNA-AceB and gRNA-EmrE, two fragments are synthesized by Sangon Biotech Company Figure 6: Construction of T7-SCVE

were negative controls and demonstrate that no residual EtBr was present in the absence of DNA bonded to the glass.Figure 1 shows that EtBr localized in the regions where DNA was added to the slides.This indicates that there is at least some DNA present on these slides after the wash.It is possible to state that this is the the newly ligated oligonucleotide, a combination of both the 52mer and the 23mer.It is unclear whether or not the DNA washed off or just the EtBr.To recap, the RNA Ligation is an important step our system because it provides mean for PCR amplification of the newly assembled oligonucleotide.As a control, the second type of reaction is between a 52mer and a 43mer without any extra phosphate(This was done to also show that an extra phosphate was necessary for the ligation of both oligos).Figure 2 shows 4 different glass slides that underwent a wash step similar to the ones that would be done by the loomino device.Then, appropriate primers and PCR elements are added to the reaction chamber to amplify this newly formed sequence of DNA.The bottom two slides show slight orange fluorescence highlighted by the black boxes superimposed on the image.On each slide, the number of oranges circles corresponds to the number and location of the regions DNA was added to.Samples were sent out for sequencing to confirm that the proper sequences were present in the plasmids.At this point, we only need to purify the proteins from the Rosetta cells and test them on oligonucleotides to make sure they function properly.Sequences for the three different forms of TdT

laboratories can afford it.Re-inventing the lab: Development of a highly flexible, affordable and open source robotic automation platformAlmost everyone working or studying in biology have heard about liquid handlers and robots dedicated to biological sciences.1) The consumables used by these robots are expensive and can cost up to 10 times more than the usual consumables found in a laboratory, which is simply too pricey for most research groups to afford for day to day operations.Despite the fact that many know about them, and could potentially use them in their lab, very few scientists actually use automation.One of the main difficulties is getting access to one of these robots.5) Other problems like complicated not sufficiently flexible software tools (with costly updates) or the need to have dedicated personnel trained to run the robots discourage many potential users.Our team has developed an affordable, modular and open source robotic automation platform to address these problems.A second recombineering step could remove this cassette without any residual \u0093scar\u0094 sequence through a counterselection using the inducible toxin.To do so, a \u0093scarless\u0094 genome editing deletion system is being constructed using an inducible toxin and a double selectable marker (amilCP and KanR).3) Many lower throughput but still time-consuming and repetitive experiments cannot be performed by current robots because specific modules that support their automation are not available or too costly.", "design": "(Nature 2013)) were synthesized and joined to

practice, this part was built from two previously submitted parts of our team: BBa_K1744000 and BBa_K1744001.First of all, different toxin CDS were cloned (separately) in pBAD30 to obtain different

DNA to bind it with PEG onto magnetic beads.Then, we used 1 \u00b5L of both PCR products to do a fusion PCR using kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-F1 and kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers).After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Although it is not tested, we are confident that the cassette should work at least as good as BBa_K1744000.To test the effect of the toxins on the cells containing the different kill swiches:2 ul of culture was used to inoculate 198 ul of LB-ampicillin-Glucose 5% or LB-ampicillin-arabinose 1%The OD[600] was measured at different intervals during 16-24 hours using a plate readerThe only medium used in this project was LB in broth and agar form.This is a problem on many levels: it\u0092s harder to get a clean PCR amplification, the recombineering efficiency and specificity is impaired with long cassette, there is some elements that can be changed or are unnecessary and ampicillin resistance is not a good positive selection marker since it allows satellite colonies to grow within an overnight time lapse due to antibiotic fast degradation.To build it, we used BBa_K1744000 as template in a PCR with the primers pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R1 to obtain a part of this plasmid that contains the kill switch without the resistance marker.Thus, the marker amilCP, with our promoter and RBS, can not be used as a positive marker in recombineering experiments, but it could serve us as a plasmidic marker to avoid plasmid background and only the gene aph3\u0092-I would serve us as a positive recombineering marker to help us select the good recombinants.To do so, we cannot use our newly constructed recombineering cassette because the toxin will not be able to counter select with a functional vcrx027(the anti-toxin) in the background.So, the pKD4 casette was amplified using vcrx028-KanR-del-F and vcrx028-KanR-del-R (see primer details in the design section).The cassette was then purified by SPRI with agencourt bead ratio 1:1 and digested with DpnI to get rid of plasmidic background.The primer used are lacZ-homology-ext-F and lacZ-homology-ext-R. Then, the cassette was integrated in the genome through recombineering using a pSIM6 containing BW25113 strain.The resulting cassette was then SPRIed using Agencourt beads and used in the recombineering experiment.The recombineering used again the same plasmid pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and arabinose at working concentration and incubated overnight.So, the method can be used, not only to purify DNA, but also to get rid of primers and non-specific bands that are often smaller than the band of interest.It turns out that if the good colonies are blue, or, if any blue colonies can be associated with a clear result (like plasmid background for example), it would be much easier to design an automated system in the BIOBOT to seek and pick only the right colonies for screening.This system will ultimately serve as the basics for automated recombineering using BIOBOT, even if we haven t had the time to actually do it with the robot because of the early deadlines.In order to test our BIOBOT platform (which could ultimately do automated MAGE experiment), a recombineering experiment has to be set-up.After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Firstly, by doing so, we will enable cyclic deletion using our cassette on pVCR94, which is the only plasmidic that we could do so beacause expresses the anti-toxin of vcrx028 which is vcrx027 and would resist to toxin induction.Those clones will be used for phenotypic test of each toxins.The different kill switches (pBAD30-[mosT;ccdB;mazF;vcrx028]) were tested (see here for the protocol) to investigate if they worked and to know which one was the best.The cells are heated up to denature it s proteins and lysate it so in the supernatant we get only the partially denatured DNA with denatured proteins.Mix 10 \u00b5L of dense culture (overnight is far more than sufficient) to 100 \u00b5L of Chelex (5%w/v in water)Incubate 10 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius (you can put your tube in the PCR to make a program that does both incubations for you)Transfers 50 \u00b5L of the supernatant in another microtube.The procedures are specified by the manufacturer, but here is how we do it:Design your primers to have at least 20 bp of homology on both sides for the adjacent part on your futur DNA construction.Using the part in that fashion, if the colonies would be blue, it would be plasmidic background and if they would be white, then they would be recombinants (since the expression of amilCP in single copy is not visible).This part contains a portion of BBa_K1744000 and the whole sequence of BBa_K1744001.Traditionally, the recombineering technique use an antibiotic resistance gene as a positive selection system.Basically, the DNA source of the transformation doesn\u0092t need to be pure for a chemical transformation and can be highly concentrated in salt.We decided to use Aph3\u0092-II, the resistance gene to kanamycin from pKD4, a commercially available plasmid that have the characteristic to have flanking FRT sequence at both sides of the Aph3\u0092-II gene.exo firstly degrades one of the two strands of a double stranded DNA fragment through its 5\u0092->3\u0092 exonuclease activity.We found that mosT and vcrx028 were the best counter-selectable markers (see here for the results)Our multi-copy plasmid results shown that mosT and vcrx028 were the best candidates for our system, but we needed to test them in single-integrated-copy for it to be more representative.Then the two purified products were used in a gibson assembly with the linearized pSB1C3 provided by the IGEM team to obtain the whole sequence of BBa_K1744002 in pSB1C3.To assess these concern, the cassette needs to be modified in order to be smaller, more efficient in PCR amplification and recombineering and easier to work with in screening assays.Even if adding this chromoprotein to the cassette makes it bigger it can still be worth it if the difference between negative and positive clones can become more visual.To build this part, we ordered a gBlock from IDT containing a P1U8 driven amilCP ORF.Secondly, the goal of this experiment is to test the recombineering in a relatable context.Therefore, we amplified cassettes containing all the needed elements of the kill switches from pBAD30-[mosT;vcrx028] (which are basically AraC with its promoter, inducible toxin with promoter and terminator and bla gene from pBAD30) with primers (killswitch_ins_LacZ_F and killswitch_ins_LacZ_R) adding homologies that allow lambda-red mediated recombination in the lacZ truncated gene of Escherichia coli BW25113.Again, one primer on two binded in the cassette and the other one binded in pVCR94.The primers (vcrx027-del-F and vcrx027-del-R) listed in  of the design section are used to amplify the cassette as described in the same section.You can see the result in vcrx027 clean deletion resultsOne major aspect not discussed in the previous sections about our cassette is that it is really big.The primer used for amplification of the cassette were pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-R.After the gibson, DNA was transformed using chemically competent cell into E. coli EC100 strain.To do so, primers described in the design sections were used on different template: pSXT, ptac-ccdb-cassette, gBlock_FG1, pVCR94.Then another PCR was done on BBa_K1744001 with the primers vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-F2 and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers) to get its whole sequence.The principle under this method is that chelex beads display chelator molecules that bind to the ions released by the cells that could inhibit PCR.The recipe for all PCR mix is as follow:The PCR mixes were all done on ice and we followed manufacturer\u0092s recommendation for denaturation and elongation temperature.For TFBI and TFBII composition, please refer to other reagents section.Dilute digestion samples 1:2 at least to get better DNA yield.Place your tube on a magnetic rack and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Once dry, resuspend the beads in molecular grade water in the volume needed for further experiments.Transfers your tube on the magnetic rack again and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Chelex DNA purification is a quick and cheap method for DNA purification.Unfortunately, we had problems amplifying the cassette in order to integrate it in the genome so we did not have the chance to test the cassette.See the results for the cassette insertion in pKD4 insertion result section.We can now test our cassette through vcrx027 deletion.The clones were confirmed by digestion and lyophilised for IGEM shipping.This part is the optimisation conclusion of the final deletion cassette.In each case, one of the two primer in internal to the pKD4 cassette and will only bind to pVCR94 if the pKD4 cassette was successfully integrated.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and glucose amounts.Since the kanamycin marker is no longer wanted in pVCR94 and is adjacent to the gene to delete, we will delete it as well.For schematique details on the resulting plasmid, please visit:The clones for each construction were screened by digestion (results not shown) and good clones for each constructions were obtained.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and arabinose amounts.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics amounts.The full protocol is available with the kit purchase.IMPORTANT NOTE: This technique can be affected by the buffer in which the DNA lies.Both come from BIOBASIC, their catalog numbers are SD7002(S518) and SD7003(S519).Here are the complete list of antibiotics used in this project with the working concentration for each:TFBI:30 mM KOAc, 100 mM RbCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MnCl2, 15 % glycerol, pH 5.8 (adjusted with acetic acid), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.TFBII:10 mM MOPS or PIPES, 75 mM CaCl2, 10 mM RbCl, 15 % glycerol, pH 6.5 (adjust with KOH), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.The polymerase used for all experiment was Veraseq from Enzymatics\u0099.They were used as described in the primer table in the design section.You can also see in the results that the colonies with BBa_K1744001 inserted in single copy in the genome were not really blue.All the tested clones for mosT shown that behavior, but only 1 of the 3 vcrx028 clones did.Those plasmid are thermosensible (the origin of replication do not work at 37 degrees Celsius) and the lambda red system is heat induced.See the protocol or See the resultsSince vcrx028 seems to work better than other toxins, we decide to use it in order to test a cyclic recombineering cassette using the as template.pVCR94 is a plasmid isolated during the 1994 cholerae outbreak in a Rwanda refugee camp.This part is basically just the previously described cassette, but transferred in pSB1C3 for IGEM shipping of the part.This comes from the fact that recombineering uses lambda red system.As the primer name says, the first pair screened the 5\u0092 end of the insertion and the second pair screened the 3\u0092 end section of the insertion.Furthermore, the longer the DNA molecule, the more affinity it will have for the beads because it carries more negative charge than smaller DNA fragments.After confirmation of the recombinants, they were tested and it shown that both killswitch were still working even in single copy.All of these primers are described in the primer table .The cassette basically contain an araC gene for repression, an arabinose inducible vcrx028 toxin and a resistance gene for ampicillin (bla), see the part description for full design information.As shown in the results, all the recombinants tested were good.We will firstly need to take out vcrx028 to take out vcrx027 with our cassette and make our cassette \u0093pop-out\u0094 with a fusion PCR of both adjacent regions.The first thing to do is to delete vcrx028 from pVCR94.That be said, we still have a working cassette with strong results to send to IGEM Headquarters as a part.Preliminary results will not be shown for they are not necessary to the comprehension of this section.To do so BBa_K1744001 was amplified using kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-F and kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-R. Then 1 \u00b5L of a 1/100 dilution of PCR product was used in a second round of PCR to enlarge the homologies to 80 bp approximately.All PCR except those specified in the text were made with 50 Celsius degrees as annealing temperature.The inserts and the vector were then mixed for Gibson experiment.It was designed to contain the advantages of both preceding parts : the working vcrx028 kill switch and the dual positive marker amilCP-aph.The results for the clean deletion was perfect.Than a polymerase will fill the sequence left empty by the exonuclease and a ligase will join both strands together.The DNA of those clones was then extracted using Chelex method and screened through PCR using 2 different pairs of primers.There is two major adds and changes to the protocol.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.It contains kanamycin resistance from pOK12 (a commercially available plasmid) which is a truncated, shorter version of Aph3\u0092-I and amilCP, a deep blue chromoprotein Biobrick standardised by a previous IGEM team from part BBa_K592009.In this section, we will detail the experiments leading to a fully working clean deletion system through recombineering.2015 for details, this version had the multiple resistance genes region deleted and replaced by Spectinomycin resistance).Those two fact explains the major changes in the protocol.The aspects of the colonies was indeed deep blue.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB ampicillin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.The plasmid used was still pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB ampicillin, streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and glucose at working concentration and incubated overnight.(2000) and uses three protein for the lambda phage: bet, gam, exo.It is now a well known technique that uses an exonuclease to degrade 5\u0092->3\u0092 one strand of DNA, permitting the homology regions to merge.The 3 \u0091 region was also amplified on the same distance with vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -R.Store at -80\u00b0C.When needed, cells can be thawed 15 minutes on ice before using them for transformationLet cells recuperate 1 hour at 37 degrees before plating them on the right selective plate.To execute this protocol, make sure you have access to an electroporator and be carefull handling the device, as its function is to give electric pulses.Furthermore, we know that recombineering works in pVCR94 since there are quite a few articles that have used this technique to modify its sequence (one of these is Carraro et al.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin and chloramphenicol.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx028-KanR-del-F with vcrx027-28-del-verif-R; and vcrx027-28-del-verif-F with vcrx028-KanR-del-R.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_R; and 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_R.You can use 1 \u00b5L for each PCR as template DNAThe DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx027-28-del-verif-F and vcrx027-28-del-verif-R.To do so, adjacent 5\u0092 region of vcrx027 was amplified on about 200 bp using vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -R.It uses Chelex beads (available commercially) and heat to extract poor quality DNA for PCR screening only.Our team is sorry about that, but since the cassette will be optimised, we have put more effort on actually improving the cassette than making it Biobrick proof.", "result": "For the right side of the gel, the same clones in the same order were screened for the 3\u0092 end of the insertion with a primer binding in the 5\u0092 of the inserted cassette.We kept clone # 3 for further experiments because it was the one with the lowest background of non-specific amplification.The above gel shows a representative success rate of BBa_K1744000.The result shown above demonstrate that the insertion had a 100% rate of success.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.The success rate of the method is, so far, of 100%.In order to assay the expression of amilCP in single copy, it was inserted through recombineering in lacZ gene in E. coli K-12 substr.The cells were photographed to show the difference between cells with the plasmidic form of amilCP gene and the inserted version of the gene:In this previous image, you can see the appearance of colonies on LB agar when they carry plasmidic or genomic amilCP-KanR cassette.But, with amilCP, the plasmidic background will be eliminated rapidly because the colonies will be deep blue instead of white therefore accelerating the screening and eliminating a good proportion of the background.You can see that only the control exhibits a different amplicon size, and that all clones have the sized band.The presence of a band in the red rectangle means the clone is good.We can see that after 10-12 hours, all the tested clones of mosT recombinants and 1 of the vcrx028 ones started growing even if arabinose was present.This was achieved through PCR screening as described in the experiment section.As it can be seen on the above gel, all of the clone exhibit the correct size band.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.In a recombineering experiment, the longest part if often the screening.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The only thing that is not good about this result is that there is non-specific amplification in all of the clones.The second primer pair (at right) produces a 1.7 kb band if kanR-amilCP was successfully inserted in the genome and a 1.2 kb band if it did not.Therefore, we conclude that vcrx028 is the most fitted counter-selectable marker for our clean deletion system.This section shows the results for pKD4\u0092s cassette insertion in pVCR94 and deletion of vcrx028.In the other hand, it would be unlikely that the predicted band could be non-specific because we screened with two primer pairs for confirmation.For the first series of amplification, the clones were tested for 5\u0092 end of the insertion, with a primer binding in the 3\u0092 of the cassette.It also shows that both mosT and vcrx028 are the most deadly among the tested toxins.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].As you can see, the expression of amilCP in single copy is not sufficient to make the colonies blue even faintly.As you can see, the success rate is really high.The clone order is the same on 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 screening.The first one (at left) produce a 875 bp amplicon if insertion of the part in the genome is successful but no bands if it failed.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].Therefore, no product should be visible if the cassette was not inserted at the right place.Thing is that we restarted the PCR verification multiple times but we could not get rid of the non-specific binding.", "safety": "Of course, like for mechanical tests, we had our glasses on, and, if required, when we were using a reflow-oven, using gloves to manipulate the PCB afterwards.All manipulations implying a living organism have been executed in a certified level 1 biosecurity laboratory.Here are some examples of the biggest safety concerns we had during our project.A standard procedure we followed when testing new mechanical assembly, for examples the platform motion system or the centrifuge plate spinning, we would always wear safety glasses.That way, risk to damage the equipment and ourselves were lower than to run a full speed test right away.When soldering our BananaBoard PCBs, to ensure our safety and proper assembly method, we always used suitable equipment located in a controlled environment.Also, to help detect problems and prevent it, we would start with a low speed test and doing faster tests as the previous was concluding.So, when testing new design for the first time, or trying new things with them, safety was a concern we needed to deal with.For our project, we design a lot of new electrical and mechanical systems.All organism used are from risk group 1 according to the Canadian\u0092s PSDS.", "keywords": "Dronpa145N interviews automation collaborated perception computational Biohackspace beneficial development
