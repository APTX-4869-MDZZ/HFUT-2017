[2004].Note: this article was written by last year s WLC iGEM team, we are using it as it still applies to this year s project.According to the Phage Therapy Center, bacteriophage therapy is defined as \x93the therapeutic use of lytic bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infection.\x94 (1) And while this technique was discovered prior to antibiotic treatments, inconsistent results and a lack of understanding caused it to be almost completely overshadowed by antibiotics.As a continuation of the 2015 WLC iGEM team s project, we have taken the idea of phage therapy for treatment of bacterial infection to a new environment: the coral reefs.(1) Finally, while a phage\x92s ability to mutate could be seen as a safety threat, it also provides a built-in mechanism to continue to infect bacteria that have adapted a resistance to the original strain.Without zooxanthellae, corals would bleach (lose color) and die due to a lack of adequate nutrient uptake (3).Hard coral species also use the fixed carbon during the production of their Calcium Carbonate skeleton (3).Because of this the coral are, in effect, stripped of their immune defenses, and their nutrient providers.If the S. marcescens infection could be wiped out with bacteriophage therapy (see our team\x92s previous article on phage therapy below), the coral would have the potential for rehabilitation.2 Aug. 2016.Note: this article was written by last year s WLC iGEM team, we are using it as it still applies to this year s project.TolC is a protein comprised of 471 amino acids to compose a homotrimer that forms a tapered hollow cylinder 140Å in length: a 40Å long outer membrane barrel [the channel domain] that anchors a 100Å long helical barrel that projects across the periplasmic space [1].The protein is exported through translocase, such as AcrAB, then through the TolC periplasmic entrance [1].TolC\x92s role in antibiotic efflux is what interests us as a target for fighting multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.The complicated structure of Elkhorn contains many large branches with a full-grown coral reaching up to twelve feet in diameter(1).Part of the reason Elkhorn is such an important component of reef building is its ability to grow very rapidly.But our reefs are threatened now as never before in a myriad of ways, from pollution, dredging and destruction of the physical reef, to disease and an increasingly acidic environment affecting many aspects of our lives and placing the future of our oceans in danger.One such pressing concern for the coastal reefs of the southern United States (such as those located along the Floridian coast) has been a decimation and massive decrease in the populations of the primary reef building coral of these reefs, Acropora palmata, otherwise known as Elkhorn coral.(2) Phage therapy works based on the bacteriophages\x92 ability to lyse specific bacteria while not harming eukaryotic cells.The early founders of phage therapy made many mistakes that ultimately led to antibiotic treatments being favored over phage therapy.These numerous traits of our reefs, that affect so many global interactions, highlight just a few of the many benefits coral reefs provide for the earth we live on.(2) The ever increasing issue of antibiotic resistance has led to a phage research revival.The most significant cause of this scarcity, however, is rampant disease, largely caused by the human pathogen Serratia marcescens.Serratia marcescens, a pathogenic species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, is known to infect humans, as well as other animals.The goal being that a phage can be isolated that will bind to the S. marcescens TolC protein.Without the coral reefs and the solid structure they provide, erosion of beaches and shorelines would proceed at significantly higher rates due to the lack of wave dissipation that reefs provide.Without reefs, many larval fish species would lack an environment in which to develop or would lack a vital link (a food source for example) in the food chain they rely upon.(2) The bacteria are able to thrive in a wide variety of environments including soil, water, and the digestive tract of their host.Phage therapy has overcome many of the obstacles that cleared the way for antibiotics to take over, and is now in many ways superior to antibiotics.This way, phages specific to the Serratia tolC gene can be isolated without having to deal with any harmful bacteria in the lab.[4]Gossard, Kimberly A., "Genetic Profiling of the White Pox Disease Coral Pathogen Serratia marcescens from the Florida Keys" (2014).Honors Program Theses.Specifically, the infection of Elkhorn coral by S. marcescens or \x93white pox\x94 can be attributed to immense destruction of the coral reefs(4).Elkhorn coral has been subject to infection by S. Marcescens since the first outbreak of white pox in 1996.(4) Also, phages are very specific, making it difficult to kill the correct bacteria with the correct phages using the technology of the time.[1] Falkowski PG, Dubinsky Z, Muscatine L, and James W. Porter: \x93Light and the Bioenergetics of a Symbiotic Coral.\x94 BioScience: Vol."Human Pathogen Shown to Cause Disease in the Threatened Eklhorn Coral Acropora Palmata."(1) Modern technology has also allowed for the easy and effective isolation of phages without disrupting their function.(1) Phages have also been identified with coat proteins that are harder for the body to identify as foreign.First, phages can be very specific and can be programmed to target only the virulent bacteria so as to not damage the microbiomes or probiotics.Read on for a more detailed explanation of the premise and goals of this year s project.Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) is a vital reef-building coral native to the Caribbean.Finally, the researchers faced the issue of the phages being rapidly eliminated by the body and were unable to prevent it.Due to the overuse of antibiotics, alternative treatments like phage therapy have been sought.There are also small loops present on the sides of TolC that allow for phage binding or colicin attachment.While some at the time believed that they were viruses, many of the studies hinted at phages being an enzyme that was created by the bacteria.(3) The phages create two enzymes, hollins, which perforate the plasma membrane, and lysins, which attack the cell wall.Thanks to scientific advances, many of the original problems have been solved, and phages are now even superior to antibiotics in many ways.Because of the high efficiency of S. marcescens to utilize glycoprotein components in the mucus, it is able to completely outgrow any other bacteria present.(4) The lack of knowledge also led to very inconsistent reports causing Eaton, Bayne, and Jones to write a report which deemed the technique no better than prior treatments.In addition, while the body metabolizes antibiotics, lytic bacteriophages are constantly replicating in the host bacteria and thus grow exponentially in number.Because WLC is a Christian school, we want our projects to always be rooted in our faith, which is why we chose a project involving good stewardship of the Earth and its resources.(5) There is also much less risk of resistant bacteria forming as only the target bacteria will be infected while the others remain untouched.The new surge of research being done on phage therapy continues to reveal exciting new options for the technique.In the lysogenic phase, the viral genome integrates into the bacterial DNA and goes into a hibernation allowing the cell to replicate on its own until it enters the lytic cycle.Paper 5.Importance of Reef Building Coral and Associated SymbiontsThe importance of hard corals to the global ecosystem as we know it cannot be overestimated.(5) The lack of research and understanding also led to impurities being injected into patients, further infecting them, and denaturing the bacteriophages during isolation leaving them inactive.In the lytic cycle, the bacterium is used to create parts of the phage which are then assembled.The phages do this by injecting their DNA into the host.The reasons for the low population in recent years is due to a wide variety of pressures including predation and bleaching.The outer membrane protein common to many gram negative bacteria: TolC (see our team\x92s pervious article on TolC below), can be cloned into a plasmid and function in E. coli.The bacteria can then enter one of two phases, the first of which is the lysogenic phase.& Hughes, C. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF TOLC: The Bacterial Exit Duct for Proteins and Drugs.If, and when, a bacteria does become resistant to a phage, it is much easier and faster to find a new bacteriophage than it is to develop a new antibiotic.These two processes for the fixing of carbon into usable molecules (such as glucose) and stable calcareous molecules are large contributors to the global carbon cycle.It is thought that the tunnel assembly is supported by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.TolC is interesting because unlike other efflux pumps, TolC bypasses the periplasm.This name is given because of its resemblance to elk antlers, in both shape and the brown color given by the photosynthetic protozoans living symbiotically inside the coral\x92s tissue.Fortunately, modern technology has had more success with phages than the discoverers.At least one of the strains causing the infection (PDR60) can be traced back to human sewage.This protein interacts with the inner membrane translocases traffic ATPase and an adaptor protein.In 2005 it was added to the endangered species list and remains there today despite many efforts to restore and revive the population.In review, the trimer forms a single beta barrel for the passing of proteins.(5)While phage therapy is not a new technique, it has only recently started a comeback as a viable antibacterial treatment.Once a phage is isolated, it could potentially be used to treat infected coral.[1] "What Is Phage Therapy?"A review of the mechanisms that drive Serratia towards diverse lifestyles.Modern knowledge of bacteriophages gives hope that phage therapy will not only work with but surpass antibiotic treatment.Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria to reproduce.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'The students finished out the day with a snack and spent some time polishing up their presentations.We made it to day four of the camp and the students seemed as engrossed as they did on day one!The responses to this survey statement showed an initial preference towards disagreeing with the statement that \x93Genetic Engineering is Unethical\x94 with some students indicating a lack of opinion on the topic due to the 20% of \x93I don\x92t Know\x94 responses.After the camp and our rigorous educational efforts on the uses for and importance of, genetically modified organisms in the medical field, the students reflected those efforts with strong indications towards agreement that GMO\x92s should be used as vital medical treatment options.After completion of the camp, the students indicated a shift in opinion on the statement \x93You are Familiar with GMO\x92s\x94 towards agreement with the survey statement, providing evidence that over the course of the camp we presented information in such a way as to admirably educate on the topic of Genetic Modification.Harrison, Elise, and Jack presenting at Biotech Info NightIn late September, we held an informational night for the students on our campus.Throughout the week, the students learned various concepts on bioengineering, and they also spent quality time in the lab completing hands-on procedures.It is humbling to see that no one did not know whether genetic engineering is ethical or not; they all had an opinion in the matter.In our forty-five minute discussion with these students, most of them were able to formulate a better perception of how GMOs work and how they are applied to our world.It was interesting to see that this particular answer in the survey did not change significantly.Before commencement of the camp, the students showed a general lack of knowledge and disagreement with the topic of familiarity with GMO\x92s.After the camp completed, there were no responses indicating a lack of opinion, with all students showing disagreement with the question, providing confidence in the education provided throughout the week.After completion of the camp, the students showed a strong opinion on the statement presented, with all students indicating that they believed Genetically Modified Organisms were not inherently dangerous to human health.The last lab of the week, the students spent time examining living coral samples, invertebrates, and bacteria, among other microorganisms under various microscopes.Following the presentation, we had multiple students approach us and ask how they could get involved with the WLC iGEM team.Lastly, towards the end of the day, the students went to work on their group projects, preparing to present on and share past iGEM projects with each other.Overall, the post-camp surveys indicated that the students greatly enjoyed the camp, learned a lot, and would love to return for an advanced, or altered summer camp in future years!The students were asked to agree or disagree with the statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).After the presentation at Biotech Info Night, there seems to be more students who disagree that GMOs are dangerous to human health.The students were asked to agree or disagree with the statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).The camp finished off with a fun jeopardy style bioengineering game that the students seemed to enjoy immensely.During the summer, the 2016 WLC iGEM held a week-long bioengineering summer camp for high school students.In the lab, Dr. Henkel led the students through plating and culturing of microorganisms from an external source point, specifically, raw eggs, chicken, and beef.This shows that our presentation was successful in informing the students on various concepts of biotechnology.As a result of biotechnology info night, there seemed to be an increase in the knowledge and opinions formed by the students who attended.This was the perfect way to set the tone for the rest of our summer camp as we deal with not only basic biology, but also some controversial topics.We then dove headfirst into science, first with the Central Dogma of Biology prepared by Dr. Werner.We did not have much time to cover all the topics involved with biotechnology, but we were able to get the ideas into the students\x92 minds.There is less variation in the students\x92 answers.Following our discourse and our discussion on ethics, the students seemed more likely to disagree with the fact that these matters are unethical.The day wrapped up with the students putting the final touches on their presentations for Friday morning.Friday began with the last devotion of the week and quickly moved into the students presentations on past iGEM projects.In lab, after lunch, Harrison led the students through an integrated lab where the students performed PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, and a Restriction Digest.This project was a chance for them to see what iGEM was all about and hopefully get them more interested in joining an iGEM team when they get to college.Today was a very exciting and enjoyable day for the campers!The following graphs are the result of the surveys which allow for analysis on how successful our camp was for our students.Over the course of the camp, we sought to incorporate and discuss bacteriophages in great detail as they play an integral part in our current project.Most of these students have attended Christian schools all of their lives; therefore, a short conversation on the matter will not sway their minds.The students showed a very strong initial lack of knowledge on the issue of use of Genetic ally Modified Organisms for Medical Treatments.This graph is strongly indicative of the general lack of information in the community on Bacteriophages and their uses as shown by the large percent (80%) of responses that were in strong disagreement with the statement or selected \x93I don\x92t Know\x94.Students were able to learn about the structure of DNA and how it becomes RNA with licorice and marshmallows.The pre-camp and post-camp responses to the statement \x93GMOs are inherently dangerous to Human Health\x94 indicate an initial lack of knowledge on this topic due to the large volume (40%) of \x93I don\x92t know\x94 responses.This is great for the continuation of the 2017 iGEM team and we have begun to involve new members into our project.Gina first shared the principles of water with magnetic models so the students could understand the difference between hydrogen, ionic, and covalent bonding.However, it is encouraging to see how many students disagree with the statement.There was an almost unanimous vote in the post-survey among the students.Dr. Henkel had the students plate the prepared samples on selective plates in order to incorporate bacterial identification into the lab and introduce the concept of gram negativity and gram positivity among other differences used in bacterial identification.It was the student\x92s turn to make bacteria glow red, and we used the plasmids they had isolated on Monday in the mini prep to do so.At the end of the day, we introduced the campers to the group project that they would be completing.The small scale science that we are performing in the lab this week really came to life.After the camp, the surveys showed a drastic split in survey response with a large number being in agreement and a large number being in strong disagreement.We advertised this event by passing out flyers at the tutoring center and asking professors of biology and chemistry to pass along the information to their students.Elise, Jack, and Harrison spoke to the eager undergraduates and they were also given a chance to ask questions of their own.The presentations went exceptionally well and although initially intimidated by the prospect of presenting for the class, the students excelled in their explanations of complicated genetic concepts and projects.After the student presentations, Dr. Balza presented on Coral biology and Morphology, helping further incorporate this year\x92s project into the camp along with touring the schools coral reproduction systems and marine life support equipment.We had the undergraduates participate in a survey before the presentation and also after the presentation.The central placement of the responses was expected due to our measured and cautious approach in discussion of this issue and the rising issue of antibiotic resistance.We discussed the various applications of biotechnology along with the implications of our own project on coral and bacteriophages.After lunch we headed into the lab.We started the day with a devotion and light snack, progressing quickly into what turned out to be one of the campers favorite lectures; Biological safety and Warfare with Dr. Henkel.Back at Wisconsin Lutheran College, Dr. Werner walked us through the basics of genetic engineering before we went into the lab once again.The responses received pre-camp to this question showed a large information gap in antibiotic education received prior to camp attendance with a majority of students simply responding with a selection of \x93I don\x92t Know\x94.We began with some review from the day before with a fun jeopardy game.Dr. Henkel took over for the rest of the day and began with the importance of medical microbes.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': 'We ended the meeting with an icebreaker and organizing team leads for each portion of our project; with lab work planned to begin next week.Lab activities this week consisted of the plasmid isolation of the tolC gene on pUC57 for Salmonella enteric, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholera in order to move to iGEM shipping plasmid pSB1C3.K. pneumonia, and E. coli which was largely worked on by Harrison and Melissa (the first trial had proven unsuccessful because of low DNA concentration).Jack contacted the various speakers for the camp and finalized the times that they would lecture.In the lab a gel electrophoresis protocol was performed by Harrison which determined that the second enzyme digest with the four tolC genes was unsuccessful.We also advertised the Bioengineering Summer Camp on our Facebook page.After a brief break in lab activities, work resumed by looking for bacteriophages that would bind to the TolC protein for S. marcescens.Meanwhile, Elise verified that many of the tolC genes were moved successfully into pTrc99A.The E. coli tolC gene from the previous week was extracted from the gel and a ligation to the pSB1C3 vector was attempted but was unsuccessful.Unfortunately, lab progressed fairly slowly due to our staff dedicating a majority of their time to the summer camp, but no regrets, as our students had a wonderful time.This was the highly anticipated week of the Bioengineering Summer Camp!We transformed these new plasmids into the tolC deletion strain of E. coli.The Biotech Info Night took place this week and Elise, Harrison, and Jack spoke to the 44 students in attendance.A new plasmid isolation was performed with the above tolC genes by Ching Tzu and Theresa Boyadjian with just the tolC genes for K. pneumonia and E. coli.Lab consisted of an enzyme digest using the products of the plasmid isolation from the previous week which was conducted by Harrison and Ching Tzu.The binders were filled with the PowerPoints of all of our lecturers and the lab was stocked with all the materials that would be needed.Summer Camp week!Gel electrophoresis by Harrison confirmed that the E. coli tolC gene was successfully removed from the plasmid.We really wanted to get as much of our wiki completed before Wiki Night to avoid the stress that comes from doing everything at the last minute.Elise and Ching-Tzu performed Western blots to verify our tolC gene expression on both plasmids.The campus cafeteria was also contacted to request lunch boxes for the campers during the day.We held our first meeting this week to get to know one another and to get an idea on the interests of our fellow teammates.The team also decided that we would be holding another Biotechnology Information Night on campus to better educate the new freshman on the various concepts.Additionally, we verified that all of the tolC genes had been successfully moved into the pTrc99A plasmid.We were prepared to welcome our students for a week of bioengineering fun!The week before summer camp was quite hectic.The school cafeteria was also informed on the number of campers and any concern of food allergies.This week was really focused on making sure that everything was prepared for the summer camp.Campers were asked to take the same survey before and after the summer camp to gauge the impact that our camp had on them.Overnight campers began to arrive on Sunday night and the rest of our campers joined us on Monday morning for a jam packed week.We set up a poster to give the new students a better idea of what iGEM really is.This was the first week back to school and the first time that the entire team was able to be together at once.In lab, Elise and Ching-Tzu verified that we successfully moved our three new BioBrick parts into the shipping plasmid!Committees were organized to help make things run more smoothly.The new part that was ordered arrived this week: the tolC gene for Serratia marcescens on pUC57 with the pBAD promoter.This week our wiki design was finalized and various parts of the project were sent to Troy to get uploaded onto our wiki.Additionally, Elise worked on Kirby Bauer assays with the strains that contained tolC genes on pTrc99A.Thursday night was our first meeting and we decided that there would be weekly meetings from now until the Giant Jamboree.Ligation of the E. coli tolC to pSB1C3 followed.Our project was solidified and plans began to form.We needed to put all the survey answers into bar graphs or pie charts.We started the design for our wiki.We also received survey responses from the WELS teachers which were then arranged onto pie charts to be analyzed.New freshman students were welcomed to campus this week.Jack and Harrison set up a table at the campus \x93Org Smorg\x94 to recruit for the iGEM team for the following year.We created lectures on viruses/phages and antibiotics.The t-shirt design for the summer camp was agreed upon with the entire team and were then ordered.Kirby Bauer Assays were done a final time with the strains containing all of the tolC genes on pTrc99A .More phage screening was done to attempt to isolate phages.Jack contacted MSOE to guarantee their involvement with the Bioengineering Summer Camp.Another round of camp flyers were sent out to WELS churches.The team discussed the easiest and most efficient ways that this could be advertised throughout campus.Elise and Ching-Tzu started again working on moving our BioBricks into the shipping plasmid.Thus beginning our lab activities for the year as a continuation of last year s project.After this, Harrison ran a gel of the restriction digests and a gel extraction.Restriction enzyme digest followed to remove the part from the plasmid.Read about the blast that we had with our students here.', 'protocol': '', 'result': 'To avoid using any pathogenic strains in lab, we used the tolC genes of the various bacteria in an E. coli deletion strain that lacks the gene.Lane 1 is the pTrc99A plasmid with no tolC gene, lane 2 is E. coli tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid, lane 3 is Klebsiella tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid and lane 4 is Serratia tolC in the pTrc99A plasmid.Figure 2: Western blot Analysis of TolC Protein Production by Plasmid-Encoded tolC Genes on pUC57.The top right plate is our positive control, as it contains the pTrc99A plasmid with the E. coli tolC gene.Once the TolC proteins were confirmed to be produced and functional in the tolC deletion strain of E. coli, we used these strains to screen for bacteriophages.The bottom left plates contain Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumonia tolC genes on the pTrc99A plasmid respectively.Figure 4: Functional Variation in Pathogenic Bacterial TolC Proteins.Western blot analysis of the various strains containing plasmid encoded, pathogenic tolC genes demonstrate the production of the TolC protein (Figures 1 and 2).Alternatively, the genes can be expressed in pTrc99A, a medium copy number plasmid (Gel 1).Because TolC is necessary for antibiotic efflux, the presence of the protein in the outer-membrane increases antibiotic resistance.The Serratia tolC gene allows us to isolate bacteriophages specific to the Serratia TolC protein, which has potential for use in bacteriophage therapy of Elkorn coral, a highly endangered coral.However, our team plans to continue phage screening with these strains, especially the S. marcescens tolC strain: the goal being isolation of a TolC-specific phage that could be used in coral rehabilitation.After cloning the tolC genes into pTrC99A, we transformed the plasmids into a deletion strain of E. coli lacking the chromosomal tolC gene.This is likely because these tolC gene sequences are dramatically different than the E. coli tolC gene.The plasmid-encoded TolC proteins being produced in each strain are decreasing the minimum inhibitory zones (when compared to the strain containing only the plasmid).Previously, the purpose was to isolate bacteriophages that use TolC (an outer membrane protein) of pathogenic bacteria for infection.Reducing the copy number allowed better study of the function of TolC without the overproduction that occurs in a high copy number plasmid.These preliminary results do not show the induction we would expect, however, the protein is being produced.Figure 3: Functional Analysis of TolC Proteins.It is relevant to note that all of these bacteria, including E. coli normally contain the tolC gene, and therefore this gene modification will not result in increasing the pathogenicity of E. coli or causing this laboratory strain to be infectious in any way for humans.Each of the four plates was overlaid with top agar and a culture of E. coli that is lacking the chromosomal tolC gene.The average zones of inhibition in millimeters of multiple trials of Kirby-Bauer Antibiotic assays with standard deviation for both novobiocin and erythromycin is shown for each plasmid-encoded tolC gene.Various pathogenic tolC genes do not all work alike in E. coli.The top left plate demonstrates our negative control as it contains the pTrc99A plasmid with no tolC gene.We also added a new tolC gene, S. marcescens tolC, to our set of tolC genes of pathogenic bacteria.In the Kirby Bauer assays, the zones of inhibition, highlighted with a double headed arrow, demonstrate the minimum inhibitory concentration the antibiotics for each strain (Figure 3).Notably, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholera tolC genes do not appear to function in E. coli.Figure 1:Western blot Analysis of TolC Protein Production by Plasmid-Encoded tolC Genes on pTrc99A.Kirby-Bauer Antibiotic assays can be used to demonstrate functional TolC proteins.Notably, the production can be induced with arabinose when the plasmid with arabinose-inducible promoter is used (Gel 2).We first decided to move the tolC genes of pathogenic bacteria,

main task was also creation of our Wiki.', 'background': '', 'description': 'Using the rankings we have maximized and minimized codon context for two ORFs, sfGFP and mRFP to test if there is a correlation between single codon, codon pair frequencies and protein abundancy.According to the criteria that each group has to fulfill in order to get gold medal, we improved function of two biobricks, which we delivered to the iGEM Registry in 2015: one arabinose induced promoter- Arashort1 (araBAD; BBa_K1741000), and one xylose induced promoter- XylS (xylA-proD5 UTR; BBa_K1741009).Considering that the additional ribosome binding site in 5 UTR seems to be an universal mechanism which allows for an efficient polysome takeover in E. coli and possibly in other procaryotic systems, it opens new attractive opportunities, at least to develop very efficient expression systems for other bacteria like Bacillus, Lactococcus, and many other.Degeneracy of the genetic code means that some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, thus the same protein sequence can be translated from various mRNAs.Moreover, cellular RNA polymerase is more accurate and introduces less mistakes in the transcribed sequence than that of phage origin from pET system, which is important if one\x92s aim is to produce recombinant proteins for crystallography and medicine.Our group modified arabinose, rhamnose, xylose and melibiose promoters, from which AraC-pBAD arabinose promoter is commercially available.Our biggest achievement this year is the experiment in which we have transplanted a 39nt fragment of 5 UTR of gene 10 of bacteriophage T7 to three of four (melibiose inducible promoter is still under construction) tightly regulated E. coli promoters.We decided to check what is the difference in the protein synthesis rate between two very different versions of the same reading frame- sfGFP [Pedelacq JD, 2006], one composed of the most common codons (sfGFP-B, the best choice) in E. coli orfeome and another codon-monotonous as well but composed of the rarest ones (sfGFP-W, the worst case).Considering that translation in prokaryotic cells occurs on just transcribed mRNAs, slower cellular RNA polymerase can be beneficial for an accurate translation of mRNAs with stronger secondary structures, which have lower chance to form before ribosomes will cover the nascent mRNA molecule.Our group, UAM_Poznan, aims to generate four sets of promoters induced by sugars: xylose, melibiose, arabinose and rhamnose, and give the user the possibility of introducing numerous genetic circuits into one cell, which expression can be independently controlled.We have reduced promoters  size \x96 they are minimal but fully functional and tightly regulated.We have also introduced changes in 5\x92UTRs (untranslated regions), as 5\x92UTR regions with their secondary structures and 16S rRNA binding sites of different sequence and location regarding AUG codon are known to strongly influence the efficiency of translation.Our latest activity focuses on trials to find out to what extent the structure of an open reading frame (ORF) can be optimized and what is the difference in translation rate of let say optimal, less optimal, and much less optimal reading frame.In the presence of glucose, cAMP levels are low and CRP is unable to bind to the promoter, which results in blocked transcription.Our multipromoter system provides differential levels of protein expression, so one can choose either stronger promoter, or the one ensuring lower levels of inducible expression.; A novel sequence element derived from bacteriophage T7 mRNA acts as an enhancer of translation of the lacZ gene in Escherichia coli.These year\x92s improved constructs are as follows: BBa_K2014003 - pBAD-M5 UTR->sfGFP \x96 improvement of pBAD promoter (BBa_K1741000) with M5\x92UTR,BBa_K2014004 - pxylS-M5 UTR->sfGFP - improvement of XylS promoter

sugars: arabinose (Ara promoters), rhamnose (Rha promoters), xylose (Xyl promoters) and melibiose (Mel promoters).Further experiments concern examining codon context effect, a hypothesis claiming that the translational efficiency of a given codon depends highly on its neighboring codons.Right now, pET lactose/IPTG induced T7 RNA polymerase dependent system, which enables high efficiency of protein production, is the most popular one.The frequency of particular codons in the gene of interest can cause expression problems because of rarely occurring tRNAs.sfGFP_B and sfGFP_W constructs differ within all codons with the exception of the first ten residues that correspond to a stable N-end as a 6-histidine tag, which is often used for affinity purification of recombinant proteins.We have substituted original 5\x92UTRs of genes located downstream these promoters with synthetic sequences considering RNA structure, the RBS motif and its positioning.We would like to check which approach to optimize a reading frame is the best and to what extent it can improve the expression of the optimized gene.We have checked if four rare arginine codons (namely AGG and AGA) added to the 3  end of GFP reading frame will influence its translation.Song S., Park C.; Organization and Regulation of the D-Xylose Operons in Escherichia coli K-12: XylR Acts as a Transcriptional Activator.Roles of Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein and the Carboxyl-Terminal Domain of the a Subunit in Transcription Activation of the Escherichia coli rhaBAD Operon.(1995) Effects of rare codon clusters on high-level expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli.These factors are dependent on the binding of the catabolite receptor protein (CRP)-cAMP complex to the promoter.Promoter is induced by a specific sugar and starts the expression of a gene.The choice of a proper promoter is a factor highly affecting protein expression.It appears that all fusion promoters (araE1, xylE1, rhaE1) are still much tighter than the lactose induced T7 systems and all fusion promoters are much more responsive to inducers.According to bioinformatics analysis we indicated 7 codons that occur in E.coli genome with the least frequency rate.It is believed that by codon optimization one can substantially increase the gene expression and that the optimized gene will more effectively compete for cell resources and will be more accurately translated [Kane JK, 1995].Journal of Bacteriology, Nov. 1997, p. 7025\x9670329.Journal of Bacteriology, June 2000, p. 3529\x9635357.We have prepared four different codon context rankings: one based on whole orfeome and three different sets of coding sequences for high abundant proteins.However, it has some downsides: the system is leaky, so proteins toxic for the host cell cannot be produced.Its leakiness is very hard to control once the stable and highly active T7 RNA polymerase is produced.Hans Peter Sørensen, Kim Kusk Mortensen., Advanced genetic strategies for recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli.Since all four sets of promoters are tightly regulated, they can be useful in production of proteins toxic for E.coli cells.E.co-Factory ensures independent induction of expression of at least two different genes and efficient blockage of all promoters by glucose.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'We\x92re glad to say that the conference was a big success for our iGEM group!We intend to spread the word about our iGEM project not only among students and other iGEM groups, but also among scientists connected with molecular biology in general.In the course of our project, we had the pleasure to spread synthetic biology among high school students who are the most valuable future source of innovation - who knows, maybe one day they will form another great iGEM team and come up with life-saving ideas.We have organized several workshops combined with laboratory classes.High school students don\x92t really know synthetic biology and most of them met this field for the first time during our workshops, probably because of the high specificity of the field and the fact that high school curriculum doesn\x92t contain this topic.The program of the workshops was divided in two parts \x96 a theoretical part where teenagers listened to a presentation about synthetic biology and, of course, safety (how to work in the lab and not to hurt yourself).We\x92ve received lots of advice and suggestions and won second award for the best poster (the poster about xylose-induced promoters).What young people think about socially important topic \x96 GMO?As a part of the XIXth Poznan Festival of Science and Art and the Night of Biologists, we have organized workshops entitled \x93Not all that glitters is gold \x96 on the fluorescent proteins\x94.Our iGEM group is not only focused on working in the laboratory, we also want to share the amazing synthetic biology experience with others - teach people about possibilities connected with this field and encourage them to expand the boundaries of their own mind.After The Night of Biologists we received an e-mail from a few students from one of Pozna?\x92s High Schools.Almost half of the respondents (46%) thought that they know what synthetic biology is dealing with but only 55% of those were able to give definition of this field.Combining fun with learning is the best way to spread knowledge about molecular biology and learn safety rules of working in a laboratory.In the meantime students prepared agarose gel and performed protein extraction.Next places went to zoology (11%), molecular biology (7%) and new generation drugs (7%).Majority (93%) knows what the GMO abbreviation stands for.In March (18-19.03.2016) we had a pleasure to participate in scientific conference \x93Biological problems of the modern world\x94 organized by Student Scientific Circle of Naturalists (Ko?o Naukowe Przyrodników, KNP) at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna?.First place went to Maria Sk?odowska-Curie (40%), the second place was taken by Albert Einstein (29%), what was not very surprising \x96 the former was a double Nobel prize winner and the latter is probably the most known scientist of all time all over the world.The results of extraction and gel electrophoresis confirmed that the students have good abilities to work in laboratory.Both the extraction and the PCR were a great success!The Night of Biologists is an event organized every year in January at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna?.The biology teacher from Turek\x92s High School was impressed with our workshops during Pozna?\x92s Festival of Science and Art.The first group started at 4 p.m. and the last one finished at 11 p.m. We hosted both organized as well as young people keen on science or even parents with teenagers.There was an anniversary cake, speeches of former Presidents and members of the KNP and the motivational talk from the Dean of our faculty.At the conference, our group presented our iGEM work in details during oral presentation, which was given by Julia Zieli?ska with Daria Niewiadomska, and during poster session, where we presented two posters.During the workshops participants worked with our iGEM constructs, including promoters induced by sugars and learned basic molecular techniques used in laboratories.The most interesting field of biology in students\x92 opinion is genetics (27%), then animal physiology (17%) and biotechnology (15%).One of the teenagers wrote about his teacher, what must be a real appreciation of his work!The results were similar for the question about using drugs produced with GMOs \x96 70% agreed, 17% had no opinion and 13% disagreed.We have also requested to write down the pros and cons of GMO.In January 2016 we hosted a group of 18 ambitious students from a biology and chemistry-focused high school class.We were interested in the opinion of the young people about socially important and rough topic \x96 GMO.We are glad that we could expand the knowledge of young people in some of the important and socially turbulent topics.She asked if there is a possibility to organize the same workshops for other students interested in molecular biology.In the next part we focused on extraction of GFP (or RFP) from E.coli and agarose gel electrophoresis.In the end we asked participants to fill in a questionnaire we had designed.However, we know that the best way to learn something is to do it by yourself.Marcin presented the production of miraculin protein in E.coli cells and won 2nd place in the poster contest.All of them were high school students from Turek (41%), Bia?ogard (17%), Zb?szy? (17%) and Mi?dzyrzecz (24%).Marcin Osuch was the author of the second poster, at which he indicated practical use of our expression system.Our team members explained lab safety rules and the possible ways to assemble genetic constructs.Students were also able to perform electrophoresis in agarose gel, which is used in molecular biology to separate DNA fragments.One half preferred to work in groups (47%) and second half would rather work individually (53%).We have also asked the teenagers to name a famous scientist of their choice.This meeting aimed to celebrate 95th anniversary of the KNP Science Circle and to gather students- members of science clubs from other Polish Universities, in order to share work, exchgange ideas and start the collaborations.A very famous Polish cardiologist, very important for the Polish medicine - Zbigniew Religa, who died few years ago, was also mentioned.On the other hand, threats that students see included superweeds, threats to biodiversity, human diseases, allergies, uncontrolled expansion, genetic mutations and diseases, tumors, death of natural species and unknown reactions to foreign DNA.She won 1st place in the Best Poster Contest.As a result workshops for three 16-people groups took place at our university on 17th June 2016.All the respondents were from 15 to 25 years old.Most of them considered themselves to be \x93scientific minds\x94 and only 9% identified as \x94humanistics All of them attended a high school program with extended biology and chemistry curriculum.Most of high school students know what GMO means and what the abbreviation stands for.This time we hosted a lot of students from Pozna?\x92s high schools.In our laboratory we hosted 5 groups, 16 students each.We decided to organize four laboratory workshops for high school students.Furthermore, we described all stages of recombinant protein production and then they also performed protein extraction from E.coli.We also told them about synthetic biology and described our iGEM project.Half of them (54%) declared to accept genetic modification, 39% had no opinion and only 7% disagreed.They attended the final year of a biology-chemistry class and they were keen on molecular biology.Asked for using GM animals in study of human disease pathogenesis most of them (74%) agreed, 17% had no opinion and 9% disagreed.It is nice that young people know not only a world-known scientist but also a Polish one.Each practical class ended with a quiz about synthetic biology.Their friend had taken part in our laboratories and they asked if it is possible to organize a meeting for them too.Each student performed their first PCR and amplified different parts of our iGEM genetic constructs such as promoters, protein-coding sequences.60% of students viewed themselves as extroverts, 36% as introverts and 4% of teenagers had no opinion.Many of them have no opinion on using GMOs, possibly because of incomplete knowledge or contradictory information from different sources \x96 school, politicians, internet, television.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': 'After cutting the bands from the gel and cleaning them on columns \x96 we performed the CPEC reaction!This week we repeated the experiment and compared three versions (sfGFP, sfGFP_Best, sfGFP_Worst) of green fluorescent proteins production on three different media: SB/PKB, 1xLB and M9 minimal medium.Next day we measured the fluorescence of the samples on Tecan (See: Methods) to check the difference in protein production between two versions of GFP.We compared the fluorescence of all variants of the green fluorescent protein (sfGFP, sfGFP_Best, sfGFP_Worst) under wild-type arabinose promoter (araBAD-araC) on 3 media: 1xLB, SB/PKB and M9 minimal medium.Then we isolated plasmids from single colony and sent them to sequencing laboratory.In order to have glycerol stocks, which are necessary for further experiments we performed 17 electroporation with 17 different constructs!It was a lot of work but hopefully everything went perfect and next day we obtained colonies on solid LB dishes.Next day we prepared cultures (we started from OD600= 0.4) and add xylose to the final concentration 0.4%.This week started with good news- sequencing confirmed the sequences of genetic constructs of GFP_best and GFP_worst under arabinose promoter!We introduced the isolated plasmids to E.coli DH5? by electroporation.In the richest medium- SB/PKB there isn\x92t any change in fluorescence intensity between all sfGFP versions.We also introduced two variants of RFP to E.coli DH5? by electroporation.We used the cultures from the previous day to inoculate 1xLB and M9 minimal medium with 0.4% arabinose.We have successfully obtained another two constructs: RFP_Best and RFP_Worst under the arabinose promoter (araBAD-araC) (BBa_K1481002).Those two variants of sfGFP and primers with overlaps were ordered in IDT at the end of the week- now we are waiting\x85Our exams at the university have finished and we can concentrate on iGEM project!In the morning we started culturing the bacteria in 1xLB and M9 minimal media with 0.4% arabinose.When we obtained all fragments needed to assembly our constructs, we performed CPEC reaction to obtain two constructs.This week we started from desalting the CPEC products on silica columns.Below you can see the photo made under the Blue light.To verify the sequence of our arabinose promoter and GFP_Best/Worst we isolated plasmids and sent them to sequencing laboratory.We also performed the PCR to amplify the arabinose promoter and the vector (pSB1C3).The fluorescence was measured during 6h culture in three medias (1xLB, SB/PKB, M9 minimal medium) with 0.4% of arabinose.This week we obtained the list of codon pair frequency rankings.To check the production of different versions of sfGFP under xylose promoters we inoculated 1xLB, SB/PKB and M9 medium with previously prepared stocks.At the end of the week we created charts according to fluorescence measurements on Tecan.We were continuing with measurements\x85 Our instructor sent as a few interesting publications about the influence of sequences on 5\x92 or 3\x92 end of ORF on protein production and stability.Next day the fluorescence was measured on Tecan- and the results were similar to the previous ones.We also amplified arabinose promoter (AraC-pBAD) (BBa_K1481002) and visualized the PCR products under UV light after electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel.We cut out the bands that represented the desired products and purified them on silica columns.We measured the fluorescence and we could observe differences in fluorescence between RFP_Best and RFP_Worst not only on M9 minimal medium but also on 1xLB.The samples were collected every hour during 6h of culturing in the same way as already described (See Methods).At the end of the week geneblocks of RFP_Best and RFP_Worst came to our lab!We prepared cultures (we started from OD600= 0.4) and add arabinose (inducer).We performed PCRs to amplify halves of RFP_Best and RFP_Worst with appropriate overlaps in order to create constructs built of mixed versions of RFP.The scheme of the procedure is shown below.We were very surprised by the results- they showed that a simple translational circuit can easily adjust and produce GFP protein in richer medium irrespectively of codon content!Both the geneblocks and the primers were ordered in IDT.This week we spent on computer to engineer two different variants (Best and Worst) of green fluorescent protein (GFP).This week we received primers from IDT so we started from PCRs.The results from sequencing laboratory confirmed sequences of GFP_Best and GFP_Worst under xylose-induced promoters (XylWT, XylE1)- we have another two constructs.The first half of coding sequence is made of the most frequent codons and the second half is built from the rarest ones and vice versa (the scheme of the constructs is shown below).We came up with an idea to check the intensity of GFP production in SB/PKB medium (See: Materials), which is a richer medium than 1xLB.Next day we took one colony from Petri dish and inoculated 1xLB medium for overnight.All the IDT fragments and geneblocks came to our lab!The same day we also introduced the constructs to E.coli DH5? (from New England Biolabs) by electroporation.Next day we started from purifying the CPEC products and electroporation of E. coli cells.Then we performed CPEC reaction to assembly the constructs.To check the intensity of two GFP versions we transferred a few randomly picked colonies on Petri dishes with 0.4% of arabinose and chloramphenicol to induce GFP expression.The same week we also isolated plasmids and sent them to sequencing laboratory to confirm the sequence.Two versions of sfGFP were amplified using primers with overlaps designed in NEBuilder.We can\x92t wait till our further experiments!It was a \x93planning week\x94- we were wondering, which constructs should be assembled.Based on the special software- the Codon Pair Bias measure (created by our advisor- Melania Nowicka) she designed fluorescent proteins ORFs built of the most or least frequently codon contexts.Our iGEM project started at the beginning of June.Then the products were separated on agarose gel to confirm the appropriate length.We cut out the bands from the gel.The same day primers with overlaps were designed and ordered from IDT.In order to assemble constructs with those variants we designed primers with overlaps in NEBuilder.Next day we inoculated liquid LB media to prepare glycerol stocks.', 'protocol': '', 'result': 'In contrast to rich media, in M9 minimal medium the codon optimization based on codon usage is important so probably E. coli cells cannot quickly biosynthesize minor tRNA molecules and keep up with translation from ORF composed of the least frequent codons with same efficiency as optimized ORF.We have found that there is no obvious difference between sfGFP translation encoded by optimized codons (which are the most frequent in E. coli orfeome) and the inversely optimized ORF composed of the synonymous rare codons in E. coli cells growing in rich media (SB/PKB or LB).2, 3, 4) suggest that in E. coli cells rich media, the introduction of rare codons into a sequence coding for a well soluble protein, expressed at a moderate level (like in pBAD systems) is not sufficient to observe any significant decrease in the rate of its translation.Translational rate of different variants of sfGFP ORFs during 6h culture of E. coli DH5? in the rich medium \x96 LB upon induction with L-arabinose (0h) (0,4% final concentration).We decided to check what is the difference in the protein synthesis rate between two very different versions of the same reading frame, one composed of the most common codons which occur in E. coli orfeome (sfGFP-B, the best choice) and a very different codon-monotonous as well ORF but composed of the rarest codons (sfGFP-W, the worst case) (Fig.Translational rate of different variants of sfGFP ORFs during 6h culture of E. coli DH5? in the richest medium \x96 SB/PKB upon induction with L-arabinose (0h) (0,4% final concentration).Instead of arginine residues, sfGFP_TagX has a degradation tag at before stop codons (coding for a decapeptide sequence: ANDENYALAA), which is added to defective mRNAs devoid of stop codons, by translation of tmRNA which binds to the vacant A-site on a stalled ribosome and directs the truncated protein to proteolysis [Hayes et al, 2001].We wanted to check to what extent such four consecutive codons could be detrimental to the biosynthesis of a stable and soluble recombinant protein in E. coli.We have created another four constructs with sfGFP_B and sfGFP_W composed of exclusively the most frequent or the rarest codons in E. coli orfeome under both wild-type xylose induced promoter and pxylS-E1_5\x92UTR.Much of the codon-usage literature focuses on inefficient translation of a set of rare codons in E. coli [Kane, 1995] especially those for arginine, namely AGG and AGA.In M9 minimal medium the codon optimization based on codon usage is more important because the translational apparatus has to adjust in E. coli cells and biosynthesize the less common tRNA molecules.The synonymous codons in protein coding genes are not necessarily random; codon usage bias is correlated with imbalance in the tRNA pool.To overcome this problem and enhance the expression of \x93difficult\x94 ORFs containing rare codons there are available special E. coli strains like BL21 Codon Plus [Rosano GL, Ceccarelli, 2009], which encode additional tRNAs and recognize these codons.The translational rate of sfGFP from inverse optimized ORF is higher or equal to sfGFP biosynthesized from the most frequent codons.Further experiments concern examining codon context effect, a hypothesis claiming that the translational efficiency of a given codon depends highly on its neighboring codons.In order to check if the same results can be observed in the case of a fluorescent protein of a different sequence and structure we designed two variants of mRFP coding sequence.Thus, the codon optimization is necessary to adjust the synthetic gene\x92s sequence to replace rare codons with codons occurring in efficiently translated mRNA in host\x92s transcriptome.Translational rate of three different variants of sfGFP ORFs transcribed under control of weak and strong xylose-induced promoter during 6h culture of E.coli DH5? in LB medium upon induction with D-xylose (0h) (0,4% final concentration).The results present significant decrease in the translation rate from inverse optimized ORF (mRFP_W) comparing to the optimized one (mRFP_B) not only in M9 minimal medium but also in both rich media (SB/PKB and LB) after 18h of E.coli DH5? culturing.We decided to check to what extent codon optimization based on orfeome influence the sfGFP biosynthesis under another induced promoters to be sure that what we observe is not dependent on the choice of the arabinose induced promoter.Codon optimized - composed of exclusively the most frequent codons in E.coli orfeome (mRFP_B) and mRFP_W - composed of synonymous rare codons (mRFP_W).Translational rate of three different variants of sfGFP ORFs during 6h culture of E.coli DH5? in M9 minimal medium upon induction with L-arabinose (0h) (0,4% final concentration).This is the result of degeneracy in the genetic code, which means that some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, thus the same protein sequence can be synthesized by various mRNAs.The sfGFP_W composed of the rarest codons is efficiently translated at the low/moderate level (under control of pxylF-xylA promoter) (Fig.The opposite situation is observed between sfGFP biosynthesis under control of stronger promoter (pxylS-E1_5\x92UTR is most likely the strongest available version of a xylose-induced promoter in E. coli (See: BBa_K2014002).(2009) Rare codon content affects the solubility of recombinant proteins in a codon bias-adjusted Escherichia coli strain.The ranking and the ORF scores are calculated using the Codon Pair Bias measure (see Methods).Surprisingly it appeared that there is no clearly visible difference between the rate of sfGFP reading frame under identical promoter with an identical 5\x92UTR (biobrick: Ba_K1481002 provided by Poznan_Bioinf as well) and sfGFP_4R biosynthesis.The set of biobricks composed of different variants of sfGFP reading frame under identical arabinose promoter (AraC-pBAD) starting from the stable 6-histidine tag at the N-terminus.According to the software, Codon Composer, designed by our advisor, Melania Nowicka, she calculated a codon pair ranking for any set of ORFs and optimized the codon context considering restriction enzyme sites and other aspects at the same time.Since the difference between translation efficiency of codon optimized and inversely optimized ORF based on whole orfeome codon usage is not big we continue our investigations to test codon adaptation index and codon contexts.Codon optimization based on orfeome still leaves many questions unanswered and that\x92s why we are looking for any other general way to optimize ORFs.According to bioinformatics analysis we indicated 7 codons that occur in E.coli genome with the least frequency rate.First construct dedicated to this phenomenon was sfGFP with four rare arginine codons located before its two stop codons TAA (sfGFP-4R-Ba_K1481003 biobrick provided to iGEM in 2014 by Poznan_Bioinf team).We are working now on contrasting ORFs, which are AT or GC rich, with codons optimization based on codon adaptation index.Protein expression was induced at OD600= 0,8.Our results were difficult to believe because many people wanting to improve translation of heterologous protein optimize synonymous codon usage to better match the host organism.The results of translational rate obtained from fluorescence measurements were referred to non-optimized sfGFP coding sequence (BBa_K1741007 and BBa_K2014002).(1995) Effects of rare codon clusters on high-level expression on heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli.This indicates that E.coli translational apparatus can be easily adjusted or that such a gene takes advantage of this that it uses a different tRNA pool than highly expressed proteins do at the same time.(2001) Stop codons preceded by rare arginine codons are efficient determinants of SsrA tagging in Escherichia coli.Variation in codon usage is considered to be the major problem in heterologous protein production.We have chosen two other promoters from our collection: a rather weak promoter - pxylF-xylA (wild-type xylose promoter) and a strong one - pxylS-E1_5\x92UTR.', 'safety': 'This company, specialized in DNA synthesis, is constantly checking ordered samples\x92 quality in respect to biosafety and regulatory conformance; so that the procedure of production could be easily disrupted if biohazardous material is detected.Each member of our team had some previous experience in working in a lab.As it\x92s presented in report of Kopernik Science Center, there is an acceptance for the use of GMOs for the production of drugs but according to genetic modification in the area of the animal world, there is a clear opposition.Let\x92s focus on the field of biology and describe bioethics, which is- ,,a field of study concerned with the ethics and philosophical implications certain biological and medical procedures, technologies, and treatments, as organ transplants, genetic engineering, and care of terminally ill.\x92\x92 Working with genetically modified organisms (GMO) has a tendency to lead to difficult ethical issues in society.Before the project\x92s start day, everybody had to read special safety protocol that describes how to work with different chemicals and with Genetically Modified Organisms, how to use protective equipment and what to do in case of emergency.Furthermore, the location of fire extinguishers, first aid kits and emergency showers in the laboratory were shown by our instructor.Bacterial cells used during our project were maintained in the lab; they do not cause any risk to the environment.So that\x92s why we are responsible for raising public awareness, for telling them the truth about synthetic biology and GMO, telling about advantages and disadvantages.Actually, the main ethical issue can be associated with ,,playing in God\x92\x92.But also, what seems be an essence of ethical problem, some of them (47%) thinks that this is an unacceptable intervention in the order established by God.2.According to results published by CBOS (Public Opinion Research Center) from year 2013, we see that the majority of Poles (65%) claim that the cultivation of GMO should be banned.There must be a balance between detriment to these organisms and the benefits for humanity.,,A branch of philosophy dealing with what is morally right or wrong\x92\x92 -this is one of the common ethic\x92s definition but there are many, many more, depend on the field of interest.Some people, sometimes even scientists, are convinced that genetic engineering and creating GMOs are wrong because it is the interference into the natural, divine order.Two-thirds of responders would use the drug on the basis of GMOs to save his own life.What kind of ethical issues could E.co Factory project have?Taking under consideration the fact, that working with bacteria is more acceptable than working with vertebrates, our research should not be criticized.As we already know from our survey (you can see the results in HUMAN PRACTISE tab), people usually do not support the GMO.Bacteria transformed with our constructs were decontaminated before removal, either in our laboratory by adding an appropriate disinfectant, or by packaging for decontamination in the special autoclave.Simultaneously, majority of respondents claim that this kind of food has a negative influence on human\x92s health.It generates important ethical question: \x91What is the right balance of risk and potential benefits?\x92.Going back to ethics, working with living organism is always a controversial issue.In Poland GMO is mainly associated with the food products based on the GMO crops.To some extend it is true, we interfere with nature, but we don\x92t do it for fun!More than a quarter of responders would use such a drug in order to improve the quality of life.Most people are afraid of consequences of eating GMO food: new diseases and allergies (76%), uncontrolled genetic changes in humans (67%), uncontrolled intervention in nature (71%).', 'keywords': 'aeruginosa pSB1C3-Orikan transcription microcysis Shiga-like biosensors Rhodospirillum pathogenic nitrogenase Mississippi', 'track': 'Manufacturing',

Choudhary et alii used 1-19AA-EutC to successfully target the bulky 464kDa homotetrameric ß-galactosidase to the interior of EutS and EutSMNLK protein shells: ß-galactosidase retained its functionality, hydrolyzing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- ß-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) into the insoluble, blue colored 5,5\x92-dibromo-4,4\x92-dichloro-indigo (2012).Background on Photoisomerizing Amino Acid Substitutions: Hoersch et alii\x92s research on the incorporation of azobenzene into protein nanocompartments to impart light-inducible conformational modularity has granted utilitarian advantage to synthetic and molecular biologists alike.In light of future applications of photoswitchable molecular mechanization, Hoersch et alii note that protein complexes have been evolutionarily winnowed to exhibit deep energy wells in conformational landscapes that reflect thermodynamic ideals (in the case of chaperonins, energy wells exist for the open and closed states) (2013).These preliminary findings on the EUT BMC\x92s structure and function indicate that it\x92s among the simplest of the known proteinaceous BMCs, whereas the formation of propanediol-utilizing microcompartments (PDUs) and carboxysomes require orchestrated expression of larger genomic operons (2012).In light of Choudhary et alii\x92s experimental observation that substitution of the conformationally labile glycine with valine at the 39th residue of EutS resulted in a mutant isoform ?V/G39V-EutS incapable of punctually sequestering coexpressed eGFP:1-19AA-EutC (ergo incapable of forming complete, functional BMCs), we conjecture that an amber stop codon substitution for an azobenene moiety containing amino acid at or near 39AA will serve as an ideal candidate for photoisomerization-driven molecular mechanization of EUTs.As Held et alii allude, the contemporary understanding of EUT BMCs\x92 evolutionarily origins as selectively segregating nano-bioreactors lends to myriad synthetic applications of EUT functionality (Held, 2016).?C/K87C/S199C mutants of the chaperonin were azobenzene-crosslinked as such, and exhibited bidirectional light-inducible conformational change when examined on a native gel assay (2013).As previously indicated, Hoersch\x92s research team used PyMol and Rosetta to find all cysteine residue pairs within 5-14Å in the closed conformation, and 16.6-19.5Å in the cytosolically-accessible state.EUT bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) house enzymes responsible for isolation and degradation of cytotoxic ethanolamine, and the genomic EUT operon genes are expressed only in the presence of ethanolamine and vitamin B12 (Choudhary et al., 2012).Thiol-reactive azobenzene-dimaleimide was introduced to selectively crosslink solvent-accessible cysteine residues on the translated group II chaperonins (Hoersch et al., 2013).The most prominent aspect of EUTs lending them to utilization as model protein nanocages is the capacity for a single gene\x92s product (EutS) to homohexamerize and further oligomerize into polyhedral protein nanocages.To properly photo-mechanize protein structures with crosslinkers like azobenzene-dimaleimide, researchers should computationally verify that the conformational energy well(s) to overcome don\x92t exceed the minute forces allosterically imbued by the photoisomerizing moieties.These results indicate that the quasi-polyhedral EutS shells may exhibit greater permeability of sequestered products or small molecule cargo than their five-component EutSMNLK counterparts (2012).Background on Computational Predictive Molecular Modelling: In an effort to avoid laborious high-throughput assays of potential azobenzene-containing EutS mutants, we\x92ve opted to employ powerful modeling software to compute answers to the investigation\x92s biochemical constraints.Ethanolamine-utilizing microcompartments (EUTs) are endogenous to Salmonella enterica, Clostridium difficile , and Escherichia coli (Held et al., 2016).To address these biochemical and thermodynamic constraints, we\x92ve employed molecular modeling engines like PyMol and Rosetta to run predictions on the energetic feasibility of proposed amino acid substitutions.Fig.Further investigation of the conformational modularity of these chaperonins was carried out with cryo-electron microscopy; results corroborated the native gel findings (2013).Of the nine cysteine residue candidates for crosslinking in the chaperonin, three residue pairs were investigated, all of which appeared to impart some degree of photoswitchable conformational mechanization when crosslinked with azobenzene-dimaleimide (2013).EUT BMC functional schematic indicating the putative biochemical pathway for the catabolism of cytotoxic ethanolamine substrate into biologically-inert products including ethyl alcohol, acetyl-phosphate, and acetyl-CoA.As previously indicated, amino acids 1-19 of the EutC gene product appear to target covalently bound proteins to the interior of the forming bacterial microcompartment, as evidenced by the fluorescent puncta (points) observed in E. coli coexpressing EutS and EutC:eGFP, or EutSMNLK and EutC:eGFP.As Choudhary et alii illustrated, EutS and EutSMNLK shell proteins don\x92t merely form hydrophobically agglomerated inclusion bodies; they\x92re shown to form hydrophilic semi-regular polyhedrons of ~50nm and 100-150nm, respectively."Reprogramming an ATP-driven Protein Machine into a Light-gated Nanocage."In E. coli cultures coexpressing EutSMNLK and 1-19AA-EutC: ß-galactosidase in the presence of X-gal, accumulations of the vibrant indole indicator were observed within the BMCs, whereas otherwise equivalent cultures without EutS displayed cytosolically diffuse localization of the indigo indicator.In our fundamentally equivalent endeavors to photoisometrically mechanize the assembly and disassembly of EutS shell proteins, PyMol and Rosetta have been employed to incandesce potential candidate loci for noncanonical amino acid substitution(s).Figure courtesy Hoersch et alii\x92s research team; cited from pp."Modularity of a Carbon-fixing Protein

Ligation of the Neptune onto high and low cassettes and imaged these using electron microscopy.We extracted the Eut SMNLK via an agar stab provided from the Schmidt- Dannert lab and PCR amplified the Eut S gene using the biobrick primers and cloned on the high, low, and lac promoters onto the 1C3 backbone prior to the ligation of the Eut S gene onto these modified backbones.eGFP is good The Eut S lac: 4A5 construct has continued to show insert ligating to the 6A1 backbone on gels as well as not sequencing correctly.The nep high showed inclusion bodies but the nep low resulted in good images so we decided to use the nep low construct for all further cotransforms to be imaged.Gel.2 - Lane 2: bad cut with E Lane 3: Nep-Lo 1k3 Lane 4: Nep-Lo 1k3 Lane 5: Ladder Lane 6: eGFP-Hi 1k3 Lane 7: eGFP-Hi 1k3 Performed cotransforms of the Eut S high and low both with nep low but failed to see any turbidity in overnight cultures.Eut S lac cotransforms with the eGPF hi: 1K3, eGFP low:1k3, and Neptune low: 1K3 were carried out regardless of sequencing data.Finally, we ligated the Eut S- high, low, and lac onto PSB1C3, the bio-brick standard backbone.We redid the entire construct by repeating the gel insert of the 4A5 backbone as well as the ligation of the Eut S lac insert.We transformed the eGFP: Eut C low: 1C3 and eGFP: Eut C lac: 1C3 and Eut SMNLK: 6A1 and sequenced confirmed Eut S low: 1C3 and the eGFP high: 1C3.Due to the previous failure of the insert onto the 6A1 backbone, we once again employed the piecewise method of cloning the Eut S insert onto the 4A5 followed by a separate cloning of the lac insert onto the backbone.Colonies successfully grew of the transformed Eut S low and the Eut S high constructs on the 6A1 backbone.We PCR amplified the Eut SMNLK as well as the Eut S lac and ran overnight ligations of the Eut SMNLK, Eut S lac, Eut S hi, and Eut S lo all onto 6A1.The Eut S lac insert continued to be problematic to clone onto the 6A1 backbone because the insert and the backbone are almost identical in size.Repeated cotransforms of the Eut S high nep low, Eut S low nep lo, Eut S lac nep low, pBad eGPF Eut S lac.We used Electron Microscopy to image all combinations of eGFP and Eut S as well as the inducible pBad with various level of arabinose.Performed the cotransfoms of the eGFP Eut C low & Eut S low: 6A1, eGFP Eut C low & Eut S high:6A1, eGFP Eut C high & Eut S low: 6A1, eGFP Eut C high & Eut S high: 6A1.To remedy this, we will move all inserts from the 6A1 backbone onto the 4A5 backbone that is in the iGEM registry and repeat all cotransforms.Performed the ligation of the Eut- SMNLK, provided by the Schmidt- Dannert lab, onto the 6A1 backbone.Chose mutations at interfacial positions of the Eut S hexamer to best break apart the compartment without destroying the structure forming compartment entirely, as an intra- mutation would likely do.GENOME TEAM: Put the IPTG inducible promoter into the E.

confirmation.Re-cloned the libraries as well as re-cloned in the promoter using Gibson assembly and used electroporation to transform into E. coli cells.Realized that the 6A1 and the 1K3 backbone have the same origin of replication which explained why the cotransforms failed continuously.We next began to move all fluorescent proteins over to either a Tetracyclin or Kanamyicin backbone because these are compatible with the non-canonical plasmid that we will be using in subsequent weeks.The microscopy images were inconclusive as to if the induced overnights formed better localization than the non-induced due to a strong background fluorescence.PLASMID TEAM:Took final data for cultures of EutS mutants with AzoPhe.The 1C3 backbone was taken from the 2016 iGEM registry.Performed PCR mutagenesis to change Low promoter cassette to a medium expression level, which came back successful.Lane 3 and Lane 5 look good Made ethanolamine plates to image the endogenous Eut S compartments, but no growth was found initially.We continued to try and get Eut S lac onto 6A1 by repeating the ligation of this.For the first week, the team participated in \x93iGEM boot camp\x94 in which we quickly went through the procedures and equipment that we would be using throughout the summer.PLASMID TEAM: More PCR mutagenesis with Q5 polymerase, two rounds total with 6 loci each.Purchased Phusion polymerase for main lab, as this was the suspected culprit, with primer length and affinity the suspected problem with the other 3 loci.Sequenced the Eut S Mid overnights prior to PCR mutagenesis and imaging of this construct.Used the k808000 (pBad modified with an RBS that includes a GFP protein) from the iGEM registry and sequence confirmed our modification to the protein.We will try these next with the addition of thiamine (vitamin B1) to promote growth of the DH5 alpha NEB cells in the media.', 'protocol': '', 'result': 'We will also continue to attempt to create these compartments on the native EutS compartment of our NEB-5alpha E.Coli using our mutation library; this would enable easier growth of compartments at scale, as well as prevent the cells from losing the plasmid in media.Several issues occurred during our first attempt at the three plasmid system, which we should like to avoid if we were to repeat the experiment.Two-Plasmid System localizes fluorescent proteins We used standard BioBrick plasmids pSB4A5 and and introduced high (BBa_314100), low (BBa_314100), and lactose (BBa_K314103) promoters with the EutS compartmental structure protein (BBa_2129001), along with a EutC1-19 tagged enhanced GFP fluorescent protein (BBa_2129003) on pSB1K3 with the same high and low promoters as well as an arabinose inducible promoter (BBa_2129006, 007).Mutation of EutS Sequence to introduce Amber stop codons Using site directed mutagenesis, we changed the sequence of our EutS Low plasmid construct to instead use a Mid promoter, and we introduced amber stop codons into the sequence of EutS at residues that we selected based on predictive protein modelling with Rosetta and Pymol.Sequencing confirmed that several of these plasmids were successfully mutated at the loci we selected, including the part EutS Mutant C (BBa_2129002) which we characterized more fully with our three plasmid system and fluorescent microscopy.Additionally, we would explore the possibility of incorporating EutS and the fluorescent protein we switch to onto the same plasmid now that we have a good idea of which expression levels are most efficient.Once sequenced and confirmed for incorporation of amber codons at desired sites, we performed a co-transformation of eGFP Low (BBa_2129006) and the pEVOL AzoPhe plasmid provided by the Shultz lab, and then introduced our mutated EutS Mid plasmids via electroporation.Amber codon mutation into the sequence of the EutS gene was sequence confirmed at five loci, all of which were transformed with the prepared two-plasmid e.coli and viewed under fluorescent microscopy.We have tested and demonstrated the results of different expression levels of our EutS compartment with variable levels of tagged eGFP using a variable two-plasmid system and a variety of promoters (BBa_K2129003-K2129007)3.We introduced a 3-plasmid system using the AzoPhe pEVOL plasmid and then visualized the results of adding irradiated phenylalanine-4\x92-azobenzene to the medium of cells with the mutated plasmids5.Fluorescent microscopy demonstrates increased localization of fluorescent proteins when the EutS plasmid is present.Introduction of azo-phenylalanine amino acids to EutS structure Using QuikChange PCR mutagenesis, we introduced Amber (UAG) stop codons to the EutS sequence at residues predictively modelled to produce super and substructure altering effects.Construction of the EutS BioBrick compatible part Using the part EutSMNLK (BBa_K311004), we PCR amplified out the S protein of the operon and cloned it alone onto a plasmid backbone.The best results can be seen with EutS with a low cassette (BBa_2129006) and araC-Pbad (BBa_K808000)under non-arabinose added medium using Luria-Bertani broth (this is documented behavior on the parts page for BBa_K808000).Fluorescent microscopy of the tri-plasmid system without mutation produced similar results to the two plasmid system with successful growth in tri-antibiotic media, confirming the viability of the three-plasmid protocol.With reduced efficiency from the control, eGFP localization was still notable in the mutant-plasmid transformed cells, suggesting successful incorporation of phenylalanine-4\x92-azobenzene (AzoPhe) into the EutS structure.A three plasmid system has the potential to cause problems with successful transformation of E.Coli, so switching to a single plasmid expressing both would cut down on potential failures and also reduce the need to use as many antibiotics.As is evidenced by our microscopy, many E.Coli cells would grow far past the length of a healthy E.Coli, which we believe is largely due to the use of Ampicillin.Upon confirmation of gene presence and function, we performed high-throughput mutation to attempt to reproduce our two-plasmid expression system with genomic transcription, introducing an IPTG-inducible promoter in lieu of the normal ethanolamine operon induction into the genome.Localization of the EutC1-19 - eGFP system was tested with low, high, and arabinose cassettes on pSB1K3.Testing using our two-plasmid system has demonstrated that EutS does indeed produce localization of EutC tagged fluorescent proteins, as described in Schmidt-Dannert et al.We successfully mutated amber stop codons at at least three loci in the EutS gene4.Genome modification of NEB 5(alpha) cells for IPTG-inducible Eut expression Genome sequencing of the NEB-5alpha cells used for all our cloning was performed to confirm the presence of a functional e.coli Eut operon.Due to the considerable time-latency this procedure requires, we did not successfully produce functional mutants at the time of the competition, but we did produce a mutation library and transformed our cells.These results demonstrate that the standard BioBrick promoters and plasmids are able to produce similar results to those previously discovered, with some possibility of reduced fidelity and frequency of \x91misbehavior\x92 by individual cells.Localization was always noticeable with good levels of EutS expression, however, cells would frequently overexpress eGFP resulting in sporadic cells being extremely fluorescent and making visualization of surrounding cells more difficult.', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'resistance expression metabolism chaperonin engineered Magnetosome

half of last century, the numbers of insecticide resistant pests have been rising at an alarming rate [1].Though they might have succeeded in increasing the potency or hardiness of a fungus specie, they did not take a step further to consider that the evaluation the fungal insecticide must follow before commercialization, which includes the assessment of its toxicity towards humans and animals, dispersal, horizontal gene transfer rate, and its effects on the resident microflora [5].In reality, the amount of insecticides applied is actually proportional to the increase in resistance in the target pest population [2], [3].Some would argue that as researchers and chemical pesticide companies develop new insecticides, the resistance couldn\x92t possibly catch up.Currently, the biopesticides that are the most widespread, in terms of usage, are the entomopathogenic-fungi insecticides[4].Using an entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, that is applied as an insecticide around the world as our chassis, we have constructed a genetically modified M. anisopliae with wildtype lethality and the additional ability to self-terminate after killing its

change the status quo, the ongoing population control of insect pest will become even more of a struggle.Biopesticides, including insecticidal plant extract, bacteria, and fungi, are some of the more popular alternatives to chemical pesticides.Reid, M.

eliminate the influence of other proteins.This test aims to show the temperature influence on KillerRed protein by measuring its fluorescence after being treated for 2 hours at the following temperatures: 70, 70.5, 71.7, 73.5, 75.5, 78.3, 81, 83.6, 86, 88, 89.5, 92.2 (degree Celsius).', 'design': 'Utilizing PMcl1 from M. anisopliae, a promoter with fast activation and high production rate, high amounts of KillerRed protein with SV40 NLS will be produced and transported to the nucleus.Utilizing the promoter of PMcl1 in genetically engineering Metarhizium allows the expression of target genes to be limited to the hemocoel of the fungus  host insects, ensuring the specificity of gene expression[2].The KillerRed protein is a red fluorescent protein with excitation and emission maxima at 585 and 610 nm respectively.Through the utilization of different gene expression and location of M. anisopliae cells during different stages of its infection cycle alongside with light-induced phototoxic fluorescent proteins, we aim to design entomopathogenic-fungi-specific killswitch that can greatly mitigate the safety concerns of the genetic modified fungal insecticides in hope that it will increase the feasibility of wide spread use of these enhanced bioinsecticides.Here we show a short overview: The infection process of M. anisopliae is similar to other entomopathogenic fungi, i.e.This sets the mass production of KillerRed proteins to the hemolymph infection phase of M. anisopliae\x92s infection cycle.Gisbert Zimmermann (2007): Review on safety of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae , Biocontrol Science and Technology, 17:9, 879-920.During M. anisopliae\x92s stay within the hemocoel and other interior organs of the insect, KillerRed molecules will remain inert due to the lack of yellow light.The killswitch circuit contains the hemolymph-induced promoter, PMcl, followed by the KillerRed gene and a fungal terminator, TtrpC.This put fungal cells in direct contact with sunlight, allowing KillerRed to create reactive oxygen species like O2?-, which will disrupt the metabolic functions of the cells and eventually killing the fungi.This promoter controls the production of Metarhizium-collagen-like-proteins in wildtype Metarhizium anisopliae, the transcripts of the Mcl1 gene could be detected within 20 minutes of the fungus contacting the hemolymph, but could not be detected when the fungus is cultured in any other medium.However, chromatin is also a ROS-sensitive intracellular localization.So we designed to fuse a SV40 nuclear localization signal to KillerRed protein in order to increase efficiency of KillerRed-mediated oxidative stress.We designed our circuit to utilize the gene expression change of M. anisopliae to activate the production phase of our killswitch.When M. anisopliae depletes the nutrients in host s body, the fungus will emerge from the carcass of its host for conidiation.The increase concentrations of ROS in the cytoplasm disrupt normal cellular functions and impede fungal growth and, in the best case scenario, induce programed necrosis[5].KillerRed effectively killed bacterial cells when exposed to white light for several minutes.Structural Basis for Phototoxicity of the Genetically Encoded Photosensitizer KillerRed.In conclusion, our In-Out-Suicide system allows for more lethal genetically modified fungal pesticides to be developed because it provides them with a ability to clean up after itself, lowering their threat to the surrounding environment.the infection pathway consists on the following steps: (1) attachment of the spore to the cuticle, (2) germination and formation of appressoria, (3) penetration through the cuticle, (4) overcoming of the host response and immune defence reactions of the host, (5) spreading within the host by formation of hyphal bodies or blastospores, i.e.The following two ways have been found to be effective for killing the eukaryotic cells using KillerRed: (1) via an apoptotic pathway using KillerRed to target mitochondria, and (2) via membrane lipid oxidation using membrane-localized KillerRed.Proceedings

reaction: Using the enzyme complex soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).The Braunschweig team used with the chaperones GroES, GroEL and TF to help fold the different MMO proteins.Our team wants to engineer E. coli so that it can break down methane by cloning and expressing the sMMO of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath).The sMMO operon of M. capsulatus (Bath), figure 1, has ten known protein encoding genes, summarized in Table 1.Our team wants to engineer E. coli in order for it to break down methanol to biomass by cloning and expressing the genes methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) Hps and Phi are both part of the fixation phase of the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway and convert formaldehyde to hexolose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate respectively .Since methanol, the breakdown product of methane, is poisonous, we will also implement the Ribulose-Monophosphate (RuMP)- pathway from Bacillus methanolicus to convert methanol to biomass in three steps.Since we want to clone the genes that form the enzyme complex sMMO and use them to construct our own sMMO operon for expression in E. coli, the genes mmoQ, mmoS, and mmoR are not relevant and thus excluded from our project.Figure 1: sMMO operon of Methylococcus capsulatus

M. capsulatus (Bath) for the purpose of expressing them in Escherichia coli (E. coli).The two iron ions, the electrons (which change the iron ions), and the oxygen together with methane in the center of MMOH (bound to MMOB) make the magic happen to break one C-H bond in methane to a C-OH.To date there are two enzyme complexes known that can do the task of breaking methane; soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO), and the membrane bound particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO)1\x963.15, 205\x9656 (2015).Csáki, R., Bodrossy, L., Klem, J., Murrell, J.

Involvement of MmoR and MmoG in the transcriptional activation of soluble methane monooxygenase genes in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b.It is in this diiron center of MMOH where the actual conversion of methane to methanol takes place.At low copper levels however, sMMO is expressed which uses iron-ions in the enzyme core for breaking methane.2\x964 The methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (M. capsulatus (Bath)) is one of the most studied methanotrophs that has both pMMO and sMMO.Both enzymes break methane with the following reaction: Other than that they both can convert methane to methanol and require oxygen for the process, are they structurally very different.MMOG is thought to be a chaperone which will properly fold the sMMO proteins.More technical information about the specific functions of each sMMO subproteins after the summary.sMMO is build out of 5 proteins, whereof MMOX, MMOY, MMOZ form one protein complex called MMOH.MMOH, the hydroxylase, consist of three subunits ? (60.6 kDa), ? (45.1 kDa), and ? (19.8kDa), encoded by mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ2.Nerveless the different variance found within the other two phases of the RuMP cycle can all be expressed in E.coli too.The surrounding air will be pumped through the filter so the methane gas can be taken up by E. coli and be converted to biomass.All enzymes needed for the serine cycle, except three are present in E. coli.pMMO is expressed at high copper levels, which makes sense as it uses copper in the core of the enzyme to break the strong C-H bond in methane.Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and is leaked into the atmosphere at different natural and industrial places.Afterward helps MMOC to release methanol and resets MMOH by providing new electrons1,3.Figure 2: Overview of the sMMO protein with subunits ?,?, and ? of MMOH, and MMOB, MMOD, and MMOR.There is not much known about the function of the 12 kDa protein MMOD, formerly known as orfY.al 2009Six of the other seven genes, mmoX, mmoY, mmoZ, mmoB, mmoC, and, mmoD, encode the proteins of the sMMO complex.One aspect is that serine does not utilize formaldehyde directly, but it is added into the cycle in order to form serine.Determination by X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Fe-Fe separation in the oxidized form of the hydroxylase of methane monooxygenase alone and in the presence of MMOD.Compared to the serine cycle the RuMP cycle only needs two additional genes added to E.coli compared to the serine cycle that needs three.Even better, the enzyme  that these methanotrophs use can breakdown methane at ambient temperatures and pressure.6-9Thus if we could understand and use this enzyme it would be possible to develop tools to minimize the methane leakage at many places like barns and gas hydrates.Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde in all aerobic methylotrophes by the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase (Medh).Previous studies have shown that the most relevant pathway for this project are the RuMP pathway and the serine cycle.Methanol is an one carbon structure that is toxic to the cell.MMOD, encoded by mmoD, is thought to inhibit the process by blocking the binding of either MMOB or MMOC to MMOH.The last gene, mmoG, encodes for the protein MMOG, is not previously been uses in a iGEM project.In this step three enzymes have to be added in E. coli in order to go from methanol to fructose-6-phosphate; methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi).In another iron monooxygenase, Bacterial binuclear iron monooxygenases, a similar protein as MMOG called mimG was needed for proper folding of one of the other monooxygenase proteins6.Further studies are needed to resolve the functionality of MMOD both in vitro and in vivo.The mmoG gene is suggested to encode a GroEL-like chaperone that contributes to the correct folding of the other sMMO proteins5,6, but this is so far not proven.The first group showing that MMOD is expressed in M. capsulatus (Bath), also has evidence that MMOD can bind to the hydroxylase MMOH7.A big part of the industrial methane emission is in the agricultural sector in places like Gas hydrates are trapped ice-like crystals of gas that are only stable in a specific temperature and pressure range.& Sugimoto, S. Bacillus subtilis yckG and yckF Encode Two Key Enzymes of the Ribulose Monophosphate Pathway Used by Methylotrophs, and yckH Is Required for Their Expression.In addition will we clone the mmoG gene of the sMMO operon which is thought to encode a chaperone (MMOG) involved in folding of the other MMO proteins5,6.Nature 523, 534\x965 (2015).Liikanen, A., Silvennoinen, H. & Karvo, A.

H. & Lippard, S. J. Methane monooxygenase: functionalizing methane at iron and copper.Medh2 was therefore found to be the best candidate of the three to use in this project2.Or even better, one could convert methane to methanol or biomass so it can be more easily transported and used as a bio-fuel instead of being discarded.Hps and Phi are found in most methylotrophes, but different methylotrophes have different genes involved in the cleavage and rearrangement phase.So that the PPQ biosynthetic pathway has to be cloned into E.coli or PPQ has to be added to the growth medium.The other pathway to consider is the serine pathway.It seems that MMOD binds to MMOH in competition with the regulatory protein MMOB, which hints to an inhibitory function of MMOD7.Examples of non-orthologs pathway are ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, the tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathway, and the gluthione-linked pathway.That is why we want to implement MMO into Escherichia coli (E. coli) so that it can breakdown methane.Sazinsky, M. H. & Lippard, S. J. Methane monooxygenase: functionalizing methane at iron and copper.These bound subunits form again a dimer, resulting in ?2?2?2, with in the middle a  canyon .On each of the ??? subunits is a binding site for either MMOB, the regulator, or MMOC, the reductase2.Binding of MMOB to MMOH is needed for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation (the actual breaking of the C-H to C-OH bonding)2.The group of microorganism that has the ability to grow with only a one carbon compounds as the single carbon source are called methylotrophes1.MMOC transfers the two electrons from NADH to the diiron site in MMOH2.The goal of this final step is to break down methanol to biomass, so E. coli can utilize methanol as an energy source.Preparation and X-ray structures of metal-free, dicobalt and dimanganese forms of soluble methane monooxygenase hydroxylase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).The NAD-linked cytoplasmic enzyme was therefor chosen because only one additional gene is needed and it utilizes the electron acceptor already found in E. coli.However, there is no known activation enzyme or sufficient flux for the process of condensation of formaldehyde2.What this means is that only two additional genes, Hps and Phi, have to be added to E.coli in order for RuMP cycle to perform its function.PLoS One 8, e59188 (2013).Ochsner, A. M., Müller, J. E. N., Mora, C. A.They also showed a possible involvement of MMOD in the assembly of the metal center in MMOH7\x969.All three Medhs have been tested under different conditions and it was found that Medh2 showed similar activity in E. coli lysate as B. methanolicus under similar conditions.Hydroxylation means the adding of an -OH group, in this case the change of methane to methanol (CH4 to CH3-OH) which happens inside MMOH.15, 205\x9656 (2015).Zhang, Y., Xin, J., Chen, L. & Xia, C.

facilities, and cattle farms.We have devided our activities under the categories Our project was inspired by the possibility of capturing methane emissions in facilities where methane is produced, and

to the amount of methanol converted into formaldehyde.To get a hint about the background in our reaction we established two controls:  E. coli strain expressing MEDH2 but methanol was not added to the assay reaction In a second approach we wanted to determine the in vivo activity of heterologous expressed MEDH2 in E. coli.During the conversion of methanol into formaldehyde NAD+ is used as a cofactor, leading to the formation of NADH.Protein expression under control of a T7 promoter can be induced by adding Isopropyl-?-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG).Figure 1: Schematic overview of the

gene.The codonoptimized mmoG as well as all three genes encoding the enzymes for the methanol to biomass conversion (medh2, hps, and phi) were created as The CDS of the hps gene, encoding the 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase, contains PstI and XbaI restriction sites making it not compatible with the BioBrick system.The concentration of formaldehyde is proportional to the concentration of DDL, which can be calculated using the Beer\x96Lambert law.Instead mmoG was synthesized by IDT as a gBlock gene fragment, codon optimized for protein expression in E. coli.The second project part had

presence of formaldehyde it leads to the formation of 3,5-Diacetyl-1,4-Dihydro-2,6-Lutidine (DDL).Genes encoding the enzymes for the conversion of methanol into biomass (medh2, hps, and phi) were amplified by PCR from Bacillus methanolicus (MGA3) genomic DNA and TOPO blunt end cloning into the pCR4 vector was performed.By detecting the absorption at 412 nm, the formation of DDL can be measured.In two rounds of in vitro mutagenesis both restriction sites were removed and hps was cloned into pSB1C3 and submitted as a Before assembling the final constructs we wanted to show that each individual protein could be expressed in E. coli.Afterwards the gene was cloned either into pET-30 or pET-28 with the use of the listed restriction enzymes.Furthermore it is necessary to show if the heterologous expressed proteins are soluble expressed and not aggregated into inclusion bodies.Primers were designed in a way that they bind in the 5\x92 and 3\x92 untranslated region (UTR) of each gene.TOPO blunt end cloning of mmoG did not succeed.Aggregation in inclusion bodies prevents a proper folding and thereby proper function of the protein.Those basic parts consist of the coding sequences (CDS) of a gene.Addition of imidazol removes the polyhistidine tagged protein from the chelate complexe.For the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) we got the genes for the subunits (mmoXYZBCD) cloned into the BioBrick standard vector pSC1B3 from the Those six parts are registered as BioBrick parts under the names; Bba_K1390001 (mmoB), Bba_K1390002

nm.', 'result': 'The first goal of our project was to engineer E. coli for sufficient conversion of methane to methanol using the Methylococcus capsulatus (M. capsulatus) soluble methane monoxygenase (sMMO)In addition we had the intention to add the GroEL-like chaperon mmoG, which is assumed to have an essential role in correct folding of the multi subunit enzyme complex sMMO.All subunits were cloned into our designated expression vector pET-30 and all subunits, except MMOC, were expressed (Figure 1).Figure 1: Pilotexpression of MMOX, MMOY, MMOZ, MMOB, MMOC, MMOD in E. coli.We further cloned medh2 into pET-28 and showed soluble expression of MEDH2 in E. coli at 18 °C (Figure 3).Our second goal was to engineer E. coli for the conversion of methanol into biomass, a process that involves three different steps.In the first step methanol is converted into formaldehyde by the NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase MEDH2 from Bacillus methanolicus MGA3.Figure 3: Pilotexpression

wanted to show particular protein expression of each subunit into E. coli.We made hps compatible to the BioBrick system removing a XbaI and PstI restriction site by in-vitro mutagenesis and generated a basic BioBrick part (BBa_K1619002) .These BioBricks contain the original genomic sequences of medh2, hps and phi.We expressed MEDH2 in E. coli and purified the enzyme.Figure 5: Sequencing of hps

'[9] D. Mumberg, R. Müller and M. Funk, "Yeast vectors for the controlled expression of heterologous proteins in different genetic backgrounds", Gene, vol.By joining yeGFP to the mls with a non-polar chain we hope to observe targeted areas of fluorescence inside yeast cells that might be the yeast\x92s mitochondria.The two vectors we chose to convert were originally known as p413-GPD and p416-GPD both were produced as part of a 32 expression vector series [9].To begin exploring these opportunities, we adapted two commonly used yeast expression vectors to the RFC 10 standard and used them to express yeGFP preceded by the mitochondrial localization signal from the mitoribosomal protein mRPS12.One of the ways that aerobic respiration can be controlled in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is by manipulating the translation of electron transport proteins.Electron transport china proteins are translated by the mitochondrial ribosome, thus we propose that by controlling the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins we can control aerobic respiration.[7] M. Woellhaf, K. Hansen, C. Garth and J. Herrmann, "Import of ribosomal proteins into yeast mitochondria 1", Biochemistry and Cell Biology, vol.Its ability to grow and replicate utilizing aerobic respiration or fermentation, and its ability to survive without functional mitochondria, provide opportunities to control or alter mitochondrial function to optimize production processes or develop novel cellular subsystems in the mitochondrial space.However, there are some other pathways where the protein goes through some processing in the intermembrane space.Figure 2 Individual steps of the import reaction of protein into mitochondrial matrix [6].As shown in Figure 2 above [6], Proteins that are imported to the mitochondrial matrix have a preprotein mitochondria localization signal or mls.yeGFP is a yeast codon optimized GFP protein, its excited by light in the wavelength of 395 to 485nm, and emits light at around 510 to 515 nanometers [7].To compete with fast metabolizing prokaryotes, the surviving strategy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is to quickly convert surrounding glucose into ethanol regardless of the presence of oxygen since yeasts are more tolerant to acid and ethanol [1].We decided to investigate using expression of mitochondria ribosomal protein S12 in yeast as a means of controlling aerobic respiration.When the gene encoding mRPS12 is knocked out in BY4741 yeast, the strains exhibit a petite phenotype and become unable to utilize non fermentable carbon sources like glycerol [5].Without mRPS12, yeast mitochondria lack a functioning ribosome and become unable to produce proteins necessary for aerobic respiration.[3] E.

Green, "Mutational Analysis of S12 Protein and Implications for the Accuracy of Decoding by the Ribosome", Journal of Molecular Biology, vol.These two proteins are called the Translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria (TOM) and the Translocase of the inner membrane of mitochondria (TIM).Once the glucose in the culture is depleted, ethanol production rate decreases due to continuous cell respiration.By gene manipulation, production process can start with aerobic respiration of yeast and switch to anaerobic fermentation when glucose level is low to prevent ethanol consumption.Mitochondria have very specific membrane proteins that will allow for proteins to be imported into the mitochondrial matrix.The series has vectors with different promoter strengths, different ORI\x92s that affect vector copy number, and different selectable markers but the same MCS [9].[1] J. Barnett and K. Entian, "A history of research on yeasts 9: regulation of sugar metabolism", Yeast, vol.[6] K. Fujita, T. Horie and K. Isono, "Cross-genomic analysis of the translational systems of various organisms", Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, vol.Thus by manipulating the expression of mRPS12 we hope to optimize ethanol production in yeast.Commonly the preprotein signal is removed by MPP\x92s and other proteases [6].We proposed that the function of the mRPS12 mls could be verified by creating a hybrid mls-yeGFP protein.When glucose becomes depleted at around 6 hours, yeast starts to consume ethanol as carbon sources [1].By expressing the mRPS12 protein in a haploid mRPS12 knockout strain, we investigated its usefulness as a means of regulating aerobic respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We propose that without mRPS12 expression it is likely yeast will lose the ability to metabolize ethanol.Without the proteins encoded by mtDNA aerobic respiration stops [4].', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'It was decided that Justin would introduce synthetic biology and the Rose-Hulman

second plasmid is cut with EcoRI, XbaI, and PstI.A quick and routine purification of DNA from a restriction digest, using QIAgen spin columns for example, will eliminate the very small SpeI-PstI fragment in the first digest, or the small EcoRI-XbaI fragment in the 2nd digest).In both cases, empty vector is generated with EcoRI and PstI overhangs.Your computer must have some Java package already installed in order to use the program.Using the DNA designed above and ordered from our gracious sponsor, Integrated DNA Technologies, we proceeded to clone the three HZS genes into the standard BioBrick vector, pSB1C3, through routine restriction enzyme digestion and ligation.Our strategy for this initial step and subsequent cloning steps was to take advantage of the standard BioBrick restriction sites, EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI.In summary, this strategy uses a triple digest and takes advantage of the fact that most commercial spin columns do not capture small fragments like the EcoRI-XbaI fragment, which would have interfered with the ligation if not removed (however, gel purification is not necessary here).We also developed a strategy to use Gibson Assembly, both to clone individual HZS subunits fused to a reporter gene and to generate a three-protein operon that will produce the entire protein.Furthermore, the program will eliminate any of the standard

"The Tardigrade Hypsibius Dujardini, a New Model for Studying the Evolution of Development."In addition to these previously described proteins, we also chose three genes coding for LEA proteins from Hypsibius dujardini that are not represented in the current literature, which we designated as HDLEA1, HDLEA2 and HDLEA3.Because a copy of LacZ exists on the E. coli chromosome, lysate generated from cells without the plasmid was used as a standard, while lysate from cells with the plasmid was expected to have PCN+1 copies of the target sequence.In addition to measuring plasmid copy number, it was decided that steady-state mRNA count would also be a valuable measurement to make.Developmental Biology 312 (2007): 545-59.Guidetti R, Altiero T, and Rebecchi L.

July 9 7/5/16:Objective: Desiccation control of E. ColiIntroduced to dehydration protocol, given by mentor Mike FlanaganIntroduced to serial dilution protocolVerified genes/sequences for synthesis and tardigrade-specific promoters (night meeting)Results: Conducted our very first desiccation experiment of E.coli.At the same time we were introduced to I0500 and the ribosome binding site protocol.', 'protocol': '', 'result': 'Linear regression indicates approximately 13.4 copies of the target sequence for every cell in the reaction, or around 12-13 plasmid copies per cell.Note: The K909006-pSB1C3 harboring cells used for this run were lysed in mid-log phase, which may account for the reduced PCN.pSB1C3 absolute quantification run #3Lysate from 100,000 stationary phase cells harboring K909006-pSB1C3 was compared against a 3-point standard of 105, 106, and 107 copies.Linear regression indicates approximately 18.2 copies of the target sequence for every cell in the reaction, or around 17 plasmid copies per cell.pSB1C3 absolute quantification run #2Lysate from 100,000 mid-log phase cells harboring K909006-pSB1C3 was compared against a 3-point standard of 105, 106, and 107 copies.The comparative reference was K880005, also on pSB1C3 backbone (i.e., the plasmid under test minus the HDLEA1 coding sequence).The desiccation protocol was initially run to identify serial dilution values for each hour of desiccation that would result in a number of colony forming units per plate (CFU/plate) on the order of 30-300.Linear regression indicates approximately 30.9 copies of the target sequence for every cell in the reaction, or around 30 plasmid copies per cell.pSB1C3 absolute quantification run #4Lysate from 100,000 stationary phase cells harboring K909006-pSB1C3 was compared against a 2-point standard of 105 and 106 1.1x106 copies.Excellent agreement (within ±25%) with the observed average CFU/plate was found for both the reference and test plasmid systems after correcting for the dilution factor for H=0 hours of desiccation (i.e., no desiccation).For each hour (H=0, 4, 7.5 and 22.5) and each plasmid system under test (i.e., the K880005 reference and the HDLEA1-based K2128204), data were collected in triplicate and used to obtain an average and standard deviation for CFU/plate.Linear regression indicates approximately 25.5 copies of the target sequence for every cell in the reaction, or around 24-25 plasmid copies per cell.Three qPCR runs using stationary phase cells and one run using mid-log phase cells indicate a PCN of around 12-13 copies during log growth, increasing to around 24 copies per cell during stationary phase.Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for qPCR copy number analysis.Because qPCR consistently gave results significantly lower than the expected copy number, an alternate means of direct copy number analysis was attempted.1 billion cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100uL of CL Buffer.Finally, this protocol was used to evaluate a test LEA protein (HDLEA1).Part K2128204 (and the underlying Coding Sequence in part K2128004) was validated using a desiccation protocol that demonstrated the part worked as expected (i.e., improved survivability when the HDLEA1 coding sequence was expressed compared to when it was not expressed).This approximately three-fold improvement in survivability validates that the HDLEA1-related part (K2128204) works as expected.In contrast, the preliminary testing for the corresponding MAHS LEA protein (expressed using the part K2128200) does not show an improvement in desiccation survivability as shown in Table 3 and Figure 2.Table 3: MAHS-related (TEST_MAHS) data (raw, adjusted for dilution, and normalized)Data beyond H=7 hours of desiccation had failed positive controls that invalidated those results.10uL of lysate from E. coli was run on a 0.6% agarose gel with purified K909006-pSB1C3 at known concentrations for comparison of band brightness.Lanes were loaded in the following order (left to right)The band for the plasmid in E. coli lysate was much closer in brightness to the 10ng band than the 50ng one, indicating that close to 20 copies were harbored in each lysed cell.Due to time constraints, only a few qPCR runs could be completed prior to the Wiki freeze, so this data is still preliminary.Table 1: Reference (REF) data (raw, adjusted for dilution, and normalized)Table 2: HDLEA1-related (TEST_HDLEA1) data (raw, adjusted for dilution, and normalized)The combined graphical results for the normalized data are shown in Figure 1 below.As expected, the fraction of surviving cells decays monotonically with increasing desiccation time for both the reference (\x93REF\x94) and HDLEA1-based systems (\x93TEST_HDLEA1\x94).Desiccation Test Results for HDLEA1 (K2128204) and MAHS (K2128200)The desiccation protection part of our iGEM project involved determining how proteins in extremophile species such as tardigrades could assist bacteria to survive in desiccation circumstances.Beyond four hours, the plasmid expressing HDLEA1 shows an improved ability to survive desiccation in a manner that is statistically significant based on measured standard deviations.Things to consider would be:Microinjection technique and pressure used to injectWhether injections to the tardigrades\x92 body parts other than the gonads prove lethalUnfortunately due to time we were not able to alter these different aspects of our protocol.A preliminary experiment was run using lysate from 1 million cells per reaction.While those control issues could not be resolved in time for iGEM deadlines, it was desired to supply this preliminary information as a guide to other teams that may wish consider use of this part.Based on this data, there is no evidence that the MAHS-related system (K2128200) provides any survivability benefit over the reference system (K880005).After excluding outliers caused by edge effects, average CT values for six replicates for each sample were compared:pSB1C3 absolute quantification run #1Lysate from 1 million stationary phase cells harboring K909006-pSB1C3 was run against a 3-point standard of 106, 107, and 108 copies.The dilution factor was corrected for in order to obtain the CFU in the desiccated 20uL aliquot and normalized by the measured CFU in a non-desiccated 20uL aliquot to obtain a survival rate versus time (i.e., fraction of surviving colonies).The K2128204 part consists of the Biobrick part K880005 (i.e., a strong constitutive promoter J23100 and strong ribosome binding site B0034) followed by the HDLEA1 coding sequence from K2128004.When placed on the high-copy-number plasmid backbone pSB1C3, maximal expression of HDLEA1 is expected.Due to the reduced amplification efficiency of the 108-copy standard in run 1, cell numbers were reduced 10-fold in all subsequent experiments.These parts were further assembled into functional genetic circuits to both support expression of the proteins of interest and also to identify reference controls against which we could compare performance.The OD600 of the initial overnight culture was taken (using a 1:10 dilution proxy) in order to obtain the expected number of CFUs in 20uL using the formula (0.02mL)*(8x108 CFU/mL/OD600)*OD600.Furthermore, the range of copy numbers detected for stationary phase cultures suggests that the copy number may take some time to stabilize after cell division halts.In particular, the amount improvement is estimated to be 3.2-fold (±1.5) for H=7 hours of desiccation and 2.5-fold (±1.3) for H=22.5 hours of desiccation.', 'safety': 'To eliminate this and minimize risk, we chose to design our experiment in such a way that we did not introduce DNA coding for either the Cas9 enzyme or the guide RNA into the cells of tardigrades.All samples were put in the biohazardous waste after use.Special Considerations for the CRISPR / Cas9 systemOur design incorporated additional controls used to minimise risk when using the CRISPR / Cas9 gene modification technique.For the second part of our project where we attempted to knocking out genes in tardigrades, we acquired a culture of the H. dujardini tardigrade strain from Carolina Biological Supply.Although tardigrades pose no risk to humans and are ubiquitous in the environment we still used standard lab practices for containment and treated all specimens as potential environmental contaminants.Since the parts and the chassis are from Group 1 organisms there were no unusual safety issues posed by this part of the project.We were particularly careful about discarding tardigrade samples since they live in freshwater and are hardy, and it was not clear to us if the species used was native to our geographic area.Since we were altering the germline of an organism, one of our primary concerns when considering our experimental design using this system was the possibility of persistence of CRISPR DNA or even unintentionally introducing a gene drive.The first part involved identifying unique tardigrade proteins that are likely part of the of tardigrades resistance to desiccation and then cloning them into E. coli to see if this resistance can be transferred to other organisms.Instead, we chose to microinject ribonucleoprotein particles consisting of the Cas9 enzyme provided by New England BioLabs Inc. and complexed with guide RNA synthesized using the EnGen sgRNA Synthesis kit also from NEB.', 'keywords': 'bioreactor regulatory connecting therapeutic relationship production tCas9-CIBN non-edible Countermeasures Noro-catcher',

one of the wells (better if it flanks the PCR products when there is many of them).Close the machine and launch the migration with a 100V voltage and wait approximately 20 minutes.Add 500 µL lyticase solution to the cell pellets and incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.Washes were increased to 1ml * 5 times.For the Golden Gate assembly (GG) here we fused two protocols, using part of the one facilitated by NEB Golden Gate Assembly Mix, which contains BsaI and T4 DNA Ligase, and another which we had by courtesy of our advisor Nadine Bongaerts: Once this is done the product of the reaction can be transformed avoiding to use electroporation, since it could be ions still in the mixIn this protocol volumes and other quantities used are proportional.To carry out infection, add 10 ?l of each phage

microcentrifuge tube and spin at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet residual cells.This protocol was inspired by a protocol called \x93Isolation of genomic DNA from fungi (culture and blood) using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit\x94 that can be found under the section user-developed protocol here  In this protocol we use lyticase, thus before doing our dna extraction we prepared lyticase aliquots: Store in a freezer at -20°C (or the lyticase will loose efficiency) DNA is isolated from fungi grown 48h to 72h on Sabouraud medium at 30°C, so 3 days before going through the dna extraction we inoculated our fungal strains on Sabouraud.The phage pellet should be a white finger print sized smear on the side of the tube.Transfer the suspension to a micro¬centrifuge tube and spin at maximum (14,000 rpm) for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet residual cells.Titer the amplified eluate as described in the Phage Titering protocol.A second, fully uncoated microtiter plate should be blocked for use in serial dilutions of phage (step 13) before addition to the target-coated plate.Titer a small amount (~2 ?l) of the eluate as described in the Phage Titering protocol.If the phage titer of the amplified eluate is too low, succeeding rounds of panning can be carried out with as little as 109 pfu of input phage.Dilutions are done in a separate blocked plate to ensure that phage are not absorbed onto the target during the course of performing dilutions, which would result in a sudden \x93falling-off\x94 of signal as the phage is diluted.Plaques from the titering can be used for sequencing: time the procedure so that plates are incubated at 37°C for no longer than 18 hours, as deletions may occur if plates are grown longer.The NEB Quick-Load® Taq 2X Master Mix was used in the following master mix :The following protocol was followed : The extent temperature was chosen according to the PCR product length.The following primers were purchased from IDT, stocked at -20°C at a

incubate at room temperature for 1 hour with agitation.Libraries often contain a small percentage (less than 1%) of clones containing multiple inserts of the randomized region.If the library was amplified in this strain or any glnV (also known as supE) strain, TAG should be considered a glutamine codon when translating.Add 200 µL buffer AL, mix by pulse vortexing for 15s, and incubate at 70°C for 10 min.10\x9620 clones from the third round are usually sufficient to detect a consensus binding sequence.Decant and discard the supernatant, re-spin briefly, and remove residual supernatant with

substrate.Hold it tight and move the glass substrate laterally so that all the cotton circles fall into the wells.Additionally, we have shown that more than 60% of indigo can be degraded by bpul laccase in the 13 hours of the experiment.The cell extracts of both strains were tested for the ability to degrade indigo carmine and indigo.The same can be done for other fabrics like silk, polystyrene, nylon etc.An Image processing plugin was developed to measure the pixel intensity of each well of the scanned image of Microplate on fabric.All results shown in the figure above are made with our bpul gene expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3).ACS is a known mediator of the laccases and it is often used and needed in the studies of the laccase activitiy As expected, the 1mM indigo carmine solution is entirely degraded within the 13 hours of the experiment in the cell extract which contains overexpressed bpul.It is important to notice, that in longer experiments would probably lead to even more degradation since the degradation curve didn t reach the saturation.Construction of the strain database by the microbiology teamThis summer, our group designed an experiment to find the best stain fighting enzymes that nature has to offer.Place the glass substrate of cotton circles on fluorescent microplate such that all circles face the wells and align well.In the degradation experiments (figure above C and D), both the transformant BL21(DE3)-bpul, and the negative control BL21(DE3) have been induced with IPTG.Automated/DIY microplate on fabric-Image processing tool for stain measurementAn automated 96 well microplate for fabric was made using a fluorescent microplate, 96 well tip holder and laser-cut cotton circles.Put the tip plate holder on the top of the microplate and adhere it to the microplate using a glue.When comparing uninduced bpul sample with the control sample (BL21(DE3)) we can notice leakiness of our promoter, which is probably due to great transcriptional strength of T7 polymerase.Cover it with a lid and the microplate is ready to use for experiments.The relative change in pixel intensity is the quantitative measure for degradation of stain.The protein gel (figure above B) is showing an over-expression of the bpul, after the induction with IPTG.Catechol dioxydases were expressed with and without Fabric Binding Domains and their functionality was demonstrated in both casesSix candidate plant and bacterial enzymes were tested for expression in E. coliThree out of six enzymes were functionally expressed in E. coli and tested

circles of 6.5mm are laser cut on glass substrate.', 'safety': 'Currently the use of enzymes as cleaning agents accounts for 60% of all enzyme production (Niyonzima 2015).The main drawback to enzyme use is currently the high cost of production, although improvements in fermentation efficiency may help reduce these costs.Safety and Regulatory Considerations for Enzymatic ProductsThe use of GMOs is heavily regulated in France, particularly in regards to agriculture; in general regulation in France follows the guidelines of the European Union in terms of GMO definition and use and study rules.For industrial use, authority is given to the local prefect rather than the research ministry (Loi n° 2008-595 Art L. 532).In general, enzymes have been produced at industrial scale and used in consumer products for several decades and have been extensively studied for their potential risks to human health.The most well documented health hazards are to factory workers exposed to aerosolized enzymes at high concentrations or for extended times.In practice, exposure levels to enzymes in consumer products are much lower and probably present no health risks (Basketer, 2008).As a result, large-scale enzyme production facilities are subject to regulatory monitoring for air quality, employee health, and employee education for health risks.Lancet (London, England), 1(7607), 1177\x961181.Niyonzima 2015 Coproduction of detergent compatible bacterial enzymes and stain removal evaluation.Our project involves the discovery and use of microbial enzymes for removing stains from fabrics in an environmentally conscious way, making it less likely to face public or regulatory challenges.Only two patients produced positive results, and neither of these could be confirmed with a clinical response to enzyme exposure (Pepys, 1973).Even so, GMO use must be declared to the government.These regulatory controls are generally effective, with aerosol enzyme levels exceeding regulatory standards in <1% of more than 300,000 readings in 2010 (Basketer, 2015).At the consumer level, guidelines for enzyme exposure levels are one-tenth the occupational exposure limit.These enzymes are used as supplements to detergents.Basketter, D. A., English, J. S. C., Wakelin, S. H., & White, I. R. (2008).Managing the Risk of Occupational Allergy in the Enzyme Detergent Industry.This has been linked to respiratory allergy (Flindt, 1969) and asthma (Cullinan, 2000).This would help us realize our goal of making a meaningful application useful in real life.Enzymes have been used to fight stains since the mid-20th century, and are used to enhance the action of detergents, both by improving stain degradation capabilities and through fabric protection.Cellulases break down cellulose polymers into glucose.Amylases digest starch polymers to simple sugars.Cullinan, P., Harris, J. M., Newman Taylor, A. J., Hole, A. M., Jones, M., Barnes, F., & Jolliffe, G. (2000).As a result, GMO projects are mainly confined to theoretical use.Flindt, M. L. (1969).Enzymes replaced the previously used petroleum-derived synthetic surfactants.French guidelines state that GMOs can be subject to prior authorization, unless health or environmental risks are minimal.', 'keywords': 'scientific concentration salicylate chlorophyll illustrated Photosystem therapeutic tetrapyrrolic characterized BBa_K1875016', 'track': 'Manufacturing', 'part_favorite': 'BBa_K2043001', 'part_normal': 'BBa_K2043002\nBBa_K2043003\nBBa_K2043004\nBBa_K2043005\nBBa_K2043006\nBBa_K2043007\nBBa_K2043008\nBBa_K2043009\nBBa_K2043010\nBBa_K2043011\nBBa_K2043012\nBBa_K2043013\nBBa_K2043014\nBBa_K2043015\nBBa_K2043016\nBBa_K2043017', 'theme': '370', 'hits': 0}}, {'_index': 'team_wiki', '_type': 'wiki', '_id': 'AV3_VEvzr5lUclF2BU1U', '_score': 3.8707922, '_source': {'year': '2015', 'team_name': 'Bielefeld-CeBiTec', 'attribution': 'Dr. Jörn Kalinowski gave us the opportunity to participate in iGEM by providing us with our own laboratory and the resources of his work group.Prof.Dr. Marcus Persicke measured the standard row of gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid via HPLC-MS for us.The work group Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology allowed us to use their laboratories and equipment and showed great patience when we occupied many of the facilities.He shared his thoughts about the impact of cell-free systems with us.Dr. Michael Jewett, Associate Professor at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, gave us valuable hints about the storability of crude cell extract.Munktell & Filtrak GmbH sponsored us with two different laboratory filter papers C350L and FN3 for our paper-based Cell-Free Protein Synthesis.MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co.

guideline.A preselection of the filters was possible, because we had access to the light transmitting spectra of almost every filter.', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'The second approach would have the advantage that it takes into account the efficiency of the genetic devices, because our experiments have shown that aspects such as operator placement and translation efficiency have a great impact on the functionality of the biosensor and are difficult to predict.For the future, we envision that a model with optimized parameters could be used to predict a range of repressor concentrations for an optimal output signal and the desired sensitivity.Therefore, we investigated several crucial design aspects with our model.Simulated sfGFP production when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 8 nM repressor plasmid are used (blue lines) or when 8 nM reporter plasmid and 300 nM repressor dimer are present (green lines).A CFPS biosensor is an open system, which means that the components can be manipulated more easily than in a whole-cell biosensor.There are two fundamentally different operating modes with regard to the repressor: It can either be encoded on a plasmid and be co-expressed with the reporter, or the protein is already present in the reaction mixture.When the reporter:repressor ratio is too high, there is a strong background signal and the relative increase in the presence of an analyte is small and would be difficult to discern (orange lines in the figure).The same analyses could be performed in order to optimize a reaction with a purified repressor.Importance of the reporter:repressor plasmid ratio.As can be seen from the figure, there is a weak background signal when a repressor plasmid is used, because it takes some time until enough repressor has been expressed to suppress the expression of the reporter.According to the model, the fluorescence in the presence of the repressor plasmid should be significantly lower than in the presence of a "neutral" plasmid, which competes for resources but does not encode a repressor.In contrast, when the repressor protein is already present in a sufficient amount, there is no background signal and the signal in the induced state is twice as high.In view of these results, a pre-existing repressor protein is the better option for a CFPS biosensor.In contrast, when the ratio is too low, an induction is not possible because of the strong repression and because most resources are used for the expression of the repressor (blue).Moreover, the signal in the presence of an analyte is weaker due to the competition of reporter and repressor mRNA for resources.We then compared the results to a simulation in which the same amount of repressor dimer was present from the beginning.Otherwise, further tests and adjustments to the model parameters are necessary in advance.Using this procedure, it is also possible to generate test strips that include several spots that detect the same analyte, but give a signal at different analyte concentrations.This would allow for the amount of repressor to be precisely controlled.The results showed us that the ratio of the plasmid concentrations is very important for a functioning biosensor.Our model accurately describes the expression of sfGFP in our cell-free protein synthesis and is able to predict the effects of the competition of two plasmids for resources.We chose this operating mode for the characterization of our biosensors and used a cell extract that had been prepared from cells expressing the necessary repressor or activator.One crucial component is the repressor, because its amount is decisive for the sensitivity and background signal of the biosensor.Furthermore, when the intensity of the fluorescence is to be used for quantification, it is possible to obtain a larger linear range using several spots with different detection limits.Currently our model uses parameters for repression and induction which were determined for the lac operon.To analyze the differences, we modelled a CFPS reaction with equimolar amounts of reporter and repressor gene in the non-induced and fully induced state.Given the parameters of our model, a ratio of 1:1 yields the best compromise between low background and strong induced signal (green).We tested this prediction with a plasmid that encodes the arsenic repressor and a second plasmid that contains the arsenic operator in front of sfGFP (BBa_K1758300).For future applications it would therefore be desirable to determine the specific parameters of the repressor proteins we worked with.This is a convenient method, however, it would be an even better option to add a purified protein to the reaction.8 nM of each plasmid were used.The position of the arsenic operator relative to the T7 promoter in the PT7-arsO-UTR-sfGFP plasmid is not ideal, as the distance needs to be very small to efficiently block the T7 RNA polymerase (Karig et al.Plasmids encoding sfGFP, either with the arsenic operator (arsO) or without, were combined with plasmids encoding the arsenic repressor (arsR) or mRFP1.A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that in the absence of an analyte, the translation rate constants are most important for the output signal.Therefore, the model could significantly reduce the number of necessary experiments.Therefore, we looked more closely at the importance of the plasmid ratio.This is sufficient for making qualitative predictions about the behaviour of our biosensors, but it does not enable us to predict exact concentrations for the different biosensors we used.These concentrations could then be tested in the lab.Therefore, the amount of active ArsR was likely lower than predicted by the model.These results show that the model predictions are only valid for optimized genetic constructs and CFPS conditions.', 'notebook': 'Find out how we developed and optimized our own cell extract.See how we developed this alternative to standard biosensors, which is based on in vitro interaction of immobilized repressor proteins with plasmids containing the operator site corresponding to the

to be established and the processing of the output signal had to be taken care of.To detect the date rape drug ingredient ?-hydroxy butyrate (GHB), we had to adjust only two components of our setup: The repressor protein and the DNA sequence that the protein recognizes.By the way, you just have to spend 16 ¢ for each reaction At first, you have to combine all reagents that are necessary to conduct cell-free protein synthesis.We consider our cell-free biosensor an outstanding instrument for the detection of harmful substances in liquids.Our measurement prototype for easy and fast evaluation of fluorescence emission We aimed at developing a cell-free test strip for the parallel detection of various substances at once.In case of a transcriptional repressor, the reporter protein (sfGFP) is not expressed unless a particular ligand is present and changes the conformation of the transcription factor.Detection of date rape drug ingredient GHB with our cell-free biosensor.The paper with the reaction is storable and transportable.In case of a transcriptional activator, expression of the reporter protein is enhanced in presence of the ligand.For examination of water quality, you can simply add a water drop to the paper.When all compounds are combined, the reaction is applied on paper and freeze-dried.At molecular level, all our biosensors work on basis of the simple transcription factor-ligand interaction concept: The expression of a gene is regulated by a transcription factor protein.While the standard setup is strongly inhibited by Hg2+, the sensor setup strongly reacts when the metal is present.Cell-free biosensor for mercury detection in water samples.Data were acquired with Tecan plate reader and normalized (for details see date rape drug result page).But if you can read this, that´s probably not the case.Error bars represent standard deviation of triplicates.Error bars represent standard deviation of triplicates.', 'safety': 'Considering biosafety aspects it has to be unequivocally proven that the purified protein extract and plasmid DNA preparation are cell-free.In his opinion, the risk that possibly released DNA from our system is incorporated by competent cells and that these cells proliferate and spread out is so low and unlikely that it is negligible.Regarding biosafety, it would be a clear advantage if reproduction would not be occurring in the CFPS environment.2013), DNA is a molecule that bacteria from the environment can coincidentally absorb (Cérémonie 2004) and that therefore can affect the environment.To conclude, we think that in future applications PRIA can be used outside of the lab under the condition that these concerns are addressed properly.For further assessments of PRIA s biosafety status we interviewed Dr. Mathias Keller from the district government in Detmold ("Bezirksregierung Detmold").He lists examples for the environment where a close contact between DNA and cells are likely to occur, like sewage treatment plants, our digestive tract and the soil.In conclusion, our expert assured us that cell-free systems are safer and better to use for the user than cell-based systems.We asked how the district government deals with the release of DNA from genetically-modified organisms into the environment.For the use of these systems one does not need to be a user of a genetic engineering facility.DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2013.00005 Nielsen, Kaare M.; Johnsen, Pål J.; Bensasson, Douda; Daffonchio, Daniele (2007): Release and persistence of extracellular DNA in the environment.We want to do a risk assessment to determine to which extent DNA is released in the environment when using PRIA.This is true no matter how the DNA is produced.Guan, Zheng-jun; Schmidt, Markus; Pei, Lei; Wei, Wei; Ma, Ke-ping (2013): Biosafety Considerations of Synthetic Biology in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition.According to Dr. Keller the release of pure DNA is not governed by the German Genetic Engineering Act.So to which extent is the biosafety affected?Moreover, the release of DNA happens permanently.Cell extract is generated by cell disruption, for example via sonification, followed by centrifugation steps in which the cell debris are separated from the molecular machinery needed for CPFS (see CFPS protocols).(2015) who \x96 by creating an ebola sensor \x96 showed how cell-free synthetic biology can be a medium to transfer the findings and ideas from the lab to the field.We contacted experts in the field of cell-free biology and asked them about this topic.Biologically/chemically he sees as advantages that the stability, durability and insensibility against external impacts in cell-free systems are considerably higher than in cellular systems.That points out the public awareness when it comes to microbiology and genetically modified organisms.However, none of these problems occur when the system is cell-free.(2013): Preparing synthetic biology for the world.It is also possible to modify the DNA that is used: For example it is conceivable that it includes a kill-switch or comparable safeguards (Moe-Behrens et al.We wondered if it was possible to create a biosensor based on cell extract that is completely cell-free.We consider this a great contribution to the iGEM community.According to Dr. Keller, the uptake of DNA depends on the uptake frequency, the encoded genes (e.g.Therefore, it is important that there are no GMOs in the product.One of those is for example the problem that GMOs are brought outside of the laboratory.PRIA is an in vitro method and can be compared to ELISA, an assay which is broadly used for example in hospitals (Lequin 2005), in terms of biosafety.conferring antibiotic resistance or encoding toxins) and the selection advantage for the transformed cells.Although the cell disruption is very efficient (we had a maximum of 8 colony forming units in 100 µL of final cell extract), there are still some cells left after this procedure.At first glance, our two approaches the PRIA and CFPS differ when it comes to biosafety concerns.Projects based on cell-free approaches will probably benefit to a great extent from our findings and results.The Act just deals with the handling of GMOs.Sun, PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology explains: "[...] we have seen both cases where colony forming units come out of the extract and when they don t."Although plasmid DNA persists only to a minor degree in host cells (Moe-Behrens et al.We use the best features from E. coli and get rid of the unnecessary ones!He is the responsible officer for biosafety aspects and supervision of labs working with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in East Westphalia-Lippe region where Bielefeld is located (District government Detmold).In: Environmental biosafety research 6 (1-2), S. 37\x9653.One of our main aims this summer was to develop applications that are completely cell-free.In any case, we would recommend the user to destroy the test strip after usage, for example by high temperatures to degenerate the DNA (Nielsen et al.Biosafety issues are main aspects of iGEM projects (Guan et al.E. coli strains used in research are genetically modified organisms, you are not allowed to use it outside the lab because it might have an impact on its environment.As a chassis, it has countless advantages: It growth fast, it is amenable for genetic changes, and it is probably the best characterized organism in microbiology.', 'keywords':

constructive advices to improve our method of avermectin manufacture.We also performed some social research for human practice, we went to communities and areas where the termite problem is serious.Owing to the effort we\x92ve made for outreach, we got the chance to collaborate with ZJSTM and made great preparation for human practice.', 'background': '', 'description': 'According to incomplete statistics, all over the world, the annual expenditure of termites control exceeds a billion dollars.IGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015 has created TERMITE TERMINATOR, a genetically modified toxins expression system with a delivery carrier cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , capable of trapping termites based on their trophallaxis, and then kill the whole nest.We choose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites.Following the instruction, they open the outer shell, put the box of food inside, spread some water on the surface of the food, and place the device in a corner where is dark, damp and termites can be seen.But if the damage is due to termites, repairing will be only a temporary protection.The ZJUTT (ZJU TERMITE TERMINATOR) sees this problem and therefore cooperates with the ancient building protection department.As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people  houses, we can bring the result of the project into production.As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people  houses, we can bring the result of the project into production.With the monitor, precaution can be taken and use ZJUTT devices kill termites before they cause any damage.Under the dazzling sunshine of summer, students are sweating, reading their textbooks.When 3 months pass and there are nearly no termites, take out the food box form the device and burn the rest food if possible.Termites are not only in school but also in people s houses.What s more annoying is that, the termites are also coming!It really influences public safety and people\x91s life in a negative way.Because of the photophobic habit of termites, they always move in a covert condition.They are always one of the toughest problem for those forest keepers.In order to get rid of termites in the whole economic forest region, the forest protection agency contact ZJUTT.What s more, termites have tenacious vitality and will soon spread through the forest.Simply placing the drugs that will kill the termites is also a way we might use when locating the nest is quite impossible or the nest is quite dispersed.However, the drug used in this way is toxic to many species other than termites, and will produces much ecological pressure consequently.The special hazardous way of termites makes people ignore their invasion at the early time.Termites will die after feeding in the trap.This habit also makes termites one the city pests, which are the most difficult and expensive to control.First, termites have the strong adaptability and viability.Every summer, the termites are flying all around.Finally, the termites disappear from the region.The other is that, the holes left by termites crawling could affect the integrity and security of buildings, dams and trees.Termites are widely recognized as the fifth pest around the world, based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards woods and infrastructure.Sometimes we can do precautions by pesticide application or by reinforcing the buildings that might suffer from the termites.Walk in the supermarket and pick up the household type termites killing device produced by ZJUTT.If the termites are convicted by the technicians, termites control shoold be applied first to eliminate the future danger.What\x91s more, the hazards caused by termites to communal facilities such as large reinforced concrete bridges, gas lines, are frequently reported these years.Taking the Coptotermes formosanus as an example, which is the most harmful termite around the world; however this species once only distributed in several regions, such as Chinese mainland and Taiwan province.With the transportation of massive supplies in World War II, these termites  distribution range has gradually enlarged.In the following ten years, if possible, it could acheive mass production of TERMITE TERMINATOR and could be widely used with our designed devices.Separately over expressed in E.coli and another host, toxins were then delivered to the termites by the cell carrier.We expect that the drug will attach to the termite and be carried back to the nest, then the whole nest of termite can be killed for one time.Account for the effect of warm wet air current from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, many provinces with warm climate, plentiful water and abundant vegetation own special preferences for termites.Thus, there is a group of people working in the forest protection agency to take care of these trees.In the breeding heyday, a mature termite queen s daily oviposition is over ten thousand.Termite is an ancient social insect in the world for about 0.13 billion years.According to the above result, Zhejiang is one of the most regions of termite occupation and plagued by them.In mainland China, Coptotermes formosanus is the kind of species doing harm to housing constructions even on 20 floors; woods; communication facilities ect.It can be absorbed through and damage the mucous membranes; also harmful to the kidneys and liver.Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.With the map and other information that the agency provided, ZJUTT will draw up a plan with the optimum locations for killing devices placement.Although application with a garden hose and sprayer is relatively easy, gardeners can t simply apply nematodes to the landscape whenever they feel like it and expect them to work.As for rural country housing and landacaping? Coptotermes formosanus is the main species.Devices will be taken back to the company for sterilization and reuse.This is really a staggering number and it is the fact.As for urban housing, Reticulitermes speratus is the main species followed by Coptotermes formosanus.We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs.We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs.2013 reported in the literature, 371 destructive termite species occupy 12.5% of current total species.One is that termites take materials rich in lignocellulose as food, which causes property damage to human beings.Given that a termite weighed 1 gram, then everyone around the world should own about 500 thousand termites!Calcolated amount of food have been beforehand put into the device.Apply nematodes at dawn or dusk, because high levels of ultraviolet rays from the sun can kill them.You need to use live nematodes as soon as possible for maximum efficacy, because they have a limited shelf life.But the cost could be huge and in many cases we don t have ways to determine the range of the precautions.If they become dry, they could die.Nematodes do their work under the soil surface, gardeners don t see dead insect bodies, making efficacy hard to measure.According to the experimental results of computer simulation, average per person holds 0.5 tons of termite resources.They are now filling nearly every corner of the globe, from tropical regions to subtropical ones, which occupies 50% of the earth s area.It requires a lot of human cost in the early days.They may live in the interlayer of ceiling, walls or wood floor, eating your clothes, books and furniture.Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device with the function of monitoring and terminating for better achieving.Tree keepers together with company technicians will bring the device to the place.We decided to have the carrier for: reducing the loss; improving transport efficiency; targeting the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment to some extent.When repairing is needed, ZJUTT technicians will show up first, rather than the maintenance worker.Adequate moisture is the most important -- nematodes need water to move and find host insects.Technical staff will go to the forest for field trips to evaluate the severity.The spawning of one year reaches up to five hundred millions.Third, termites could achieve different-distance spread and distribution by virtue of flight spread, pervasive invasion and factitious carry, owning to their strong transmission capacity.The propagation of termites sometimes results in wide spread of termites  harm.These devices are used to attract termites to check if there is any new hidden termites nest.It is reported that, the direct loss induced by termites is beyond 220 billion dollars per year.These are very small unsegmented worm species which search for hosts, like termites, and burrow into them, causing death within approximately 48 hours.He advise the school stuff to buy a few small size termites killing devices from ZJUTT.Open the package and put it at places where termites can be seen.But what make them stressfol is that the forest regions are always inhabited by termites.Factory is the base and during improvements as well as experiments, social users data is collected for further promotion and perfection.There are termites all over the five continents.The harm that termites bring to human mainly reflects in two aspects.In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents.In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents.It often takes a long time from termites invasion to being discovered.Trees that destroyed by termites will lost their economic value.At present this kind of termites has caused serious damages in numerous countries and regions, turning into cosmopolitan pest.', 'design': 'Here is our device and it works in three aspects.In fact, we made a big improvement about our device on the monitor unit recently.We also design a wider ring under the cover, to avoid the slide when device shaking When using the device, customers should place the Attracting Cover with wood to attract more termites.However, when we talked about our device with Prof. Mo, an expert on termite control, he told us that when termites eat wood, their secretion flows out and sticks on the wood nearby.Further more, we decided to design a digital circuit for customers so that they may discover the situation in a shorter time with less attention paid to the device.The device works like this: Pine put in the device will attract termites and when climbing into the device, they will eat the Toxin accidently and die in or out of the device.After the effective Toxin was coated by CNC, we need a convenient device to place our poison in.Once termites eat the block, the string will elongate and another wooden block will get out of the device to alert the users.In order to be easier for the users to clean it up for a second use the device is designed to be removable.With this application, it does not matter if our customers have any problem using our device.In our new version, we abort this design and change the passageway in the box into small holes.In the last version, we used a compressed spring which is connected to a thin wooden block.By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of TERMITE TERMINATOR and present Techno-moral vignettes, focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application.Once they notice the bottom holes are getting smaller, or stuck by termites\x92 secretion, the Trap Cover should take the place of the attracting cover and the Kill Function works!One of our goals is to kill all termites in a house.We want to kill all termites but our toxin will not be influential for a very long period.Besides functions, we think more to improve our device.', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'In the last two period, Toxin starts to degrade.Here (v_{Toxin}) is the velocity that Toxin is produced.In this page, we model the process of the production and degrade of Toxin to find the influence to ({Toxin-CNC-Time}), or the degradation time of Toxin in CNC-coat.({Toxin-CNC-Time}) is the degradation time of Toxin in CNC-coat while ({Toxin-air-Time}) is that in the air.Respectively, ({CNC-digest-Time}) is the time when the bait comes into another termite s gut(trophallaxis) and the CNC-coat is completely digest there.They are (t_{2}) and (t_1), respectively.$$frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} = frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]} - frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}$$$$frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} = - frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}$$Still, use function (arctan) take the place of comparing, we get the final function.Because (n_2) must be even and (frac{1}{{x^{-100}}+1}) is the integral, we choose the last one.With some typical parameter, we use NDSolve function to solve the ordinary differential equation, the answer is as below.And (K_m) is called Michaelis constant.(V_{max,2}) is the reducing velocity when Toxin is saturation, and (K_{m,2}) is another Michaelis constantThe two equation seems simple in separate formate, but it became complex when considering time factor.For the time (t_1) is much less than (t_2), the change at that time is not obvious.frac{partial [{Toxin}]}{partial t} &=&(1-step(t,t2)) frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+[S]} - step(t,t1) frac{V_{max,2}[{Toxin}]}{K_{m,2}+[{Toxin}]}\\(step) function can be placed by (frac{1}{{x^{-100}}+1}) etc.To study the tendency of the reaction, the figure is at a long time (three of four times than (t_2)), and the dark green curve is a standard (exp) function curve.We will discuss is in the next section.We do not have enough time to measure the exact time when termite digest, but I suppose we have got it, as well as the time that Toxin starts to resolve.What we concern is that when our CNC-coat is degraded, the Toxin is still in the cell.During the first two period, cell produce Toxin.(V_{max}) is the producing velocity when substrate is saturated.([S]) is substrate s concentration.There are four important parameters in our design, which are ({CNC-digest-Time}), ({CNC-degradation-Time}), ({Toxin-CNC-Time}) and ({Toxin-air-Time}).Although we can premise that the Toxin will be separate by CNC-coat, and our device, as a second protection, can stop Toxin s spread, the only device s protection may not be really enough.While the next one, means even though the CNC-coat is degraded, Toxin will degrade right away so that it will not cause environment pollution.({CNC-degradation-Time}) is when CNC-coat degrades in national condition.In the ordinary differential function, we can solve the two condition respectively, but a continues function will enhance the flexibility and simplicity.Toxalbumin is produced by cell, and resolved by enzyme or itself.We built model for the process basic on Michaelis-Menten equation.', 'notebook': 'Discussed the application scenario for the 5000\x80 additional sponsership of SYNENERGENE.Contacted with Björn

eliminate all the termites in my apartment.Some of people who choose professional institute are those who know the severity of termite damage, for example, the security mentioned above.I threw the damaged furniture and fit my house again\x85.\x94  Although some people have experienced the damage brought by termites, the public didn\x92t know much about the current issue about termites in Hangzhou.Fig4: Booklets presented by Hangzhou Institute of Termite Control Photo by: Zju-igemer  Fig5: ZJU-igemer consulting staff of Termite Control Institute Photo by: Zju-igemer  Although China has already earned a profound system for termite control, people who suffer from termite damage would not always choose professional institution to deal with termite invasion.Fig1: Page of termite control of a pest control company in the U.S http://www.doyourownpestcontrol.com/termite.htm  Although Chinese has a much higher population density than America, there are more wood structure buildings in America, the level of termite damage in both countries are randomly the same.But those who didn t know much about the termites would like to buy pesticide, they think they can win the termites.Citizens do not know much about Termites\x92 living habits and their current condition, but they all have heard about the information of termites.They used the chemical insecticide and dug out the whole nest to control termite damage.People are willing to choose professional institute to control termites, but if their scale is not very large, people may choose kill termites by themselves.Chinese termite control institute has a low charging standard, because government pays them the fundamental funds and technical assistance for local institute.More than 70% of our interviewee have experienced termite damage, and they all know that termites can destroy woods with a super speed.Commercial corporations often provide citizens housing termite control services, and government agencies do better at the maintenance of public facilities.Some of interviewees would like to choose environment-friendly lifestyle, but most people will make their decision depend on the killing effect.In this summer, igemers from ZJU-CHINA visited Hangzhou Institute Of Termite Control to get more information about the current situation of termite control and consult with them about our project design.Words on banner: We Have To Win The War Against Termites  The Government Of China has set up institutes of termite control in various provinces since 1960s, in order to have better effects for fighting against termites.Termite control in the U.S consists of two main parts------commercial corporations and government agencies.However, as what is happening in China, some people would like to deal with termites by themselves, so some companies also provide customers advisors to treat termites in a suitable way.Fig5: the public promotion page of Chinese termite control institute http://www.zgbyfz.cn/byfz.asp?cid=%B0%D7%D2%CF%CE%A3%BA%A6  American institutes pay more attention to the customer experience.At the beginning, people who focused on fighting against termites were the commons who did not have enough knowledge to deal with termites.It is worth mentioning that the destruction left by termites seems to be much more serious on historic buildings.The terrible damage to water conservancy projects caused by termites is still a great threat to the water project planning in China.The door case became into powder, all the chairs could not be used, and the reproductive termites lay on the windows.When people have problems of termite damage, they usually look for a company to solve them.80% of the dam breaks in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Region are due to termites.Fig1: People held a meeting to discuss how to control termites in 1950s.All the wooden furniture had been damaged by termites.Would you choose the pesticide, which has a bad impact to the environment but works fast and has a lower price?Obviously, provinces seated in the region south of the Yangtze River suffer more from termite damage.Question 2: Almost 50% of interviewees would choose professional institute, and another 50% prefer to buy pesticide themselves.We pick 8 typical provinces, which locate from south to north: Hainan; Guangxi; Guangdong; Fujian; Anhui; Hubei; Shandong and Liaoning, and then gather the rough data for termite damage to the housing construction.Most citizens do not know the significance of \x91environment-friendly\x92 and do not care about the problem, and they prefer chemical termitcide.For this reason, ZJU-IGEMers tried to promote the idea of \x91From Nature For Nature\x92 to realize the environment-friendly synthetic biological method to termite control--------Termite Terminator.Would you like to choose biological control method, which is much safer but costs more?In the campus of Zhejiang University, in spring and summer it is easy to see the trees intruded by termites.The website pages of American termite control company show a customer-friendly attitude and leave an effective impact to people scan their websites.One female white collar pointed out that, it doesn\x92t matter how much it costs, the most important thing is to live healthily.Chemical insecticide costs less and the low-dose poison won\x92t be harmful to human being.People prefer to call for governmental institutes to eliminate termites  4.The integrated control of termites begins in 1950s in China.People that do not choose biological drugs have two main reasons, one is that cheap and valid chemical is enough for them to use.Fig4: trees damaged by termites in German Park photo by: Ming Chen ZJU-instructor  Every southern city in China has experienced the electric problem caused by termite invasion beneath the surface of ground.The others are those who have a higher level of knowledge, they know that they couldn\x92t eliminate termites just by themselves.The governmental institutes VS. Termite control companies.', 'safety': 'High selectivity: little to no direct toxicity to non-target insects and other shelled invertebratesThe bacterium are CNC-coated, having little to no leak of the toxic proteins consequently.Completely no harm to adults and infants when users are behaved according to our instruction Since the toxic proteins we choose are relative new, we cannot find their degradation period, degradation condition and more information related to safety.In case that our bacterium get outside and leak the toxin into the environment, we use an inducible promoter in our constructs.During the experiment, we worry that our gene modified bacterium would get out of the lab, thus we figured out several ways to make our bacterium safer.In order to avoid people wrongly operating our device, we also design an instruction of our device as below.We plan to sell our device with the instruction attached to it, and we believe that our device would be safer with our well-designed instruction.Furthermore, we considered the social safety of our whole project.However, the proteins we use are pretty like bt protein, so we will use the data of bt protein to help us analyze.About 80% can be fast digested in soil or water in 20 days, but will be a little residue (10-20%)Will NOT be reproduced in water.High selectivity: only have effects on a few certain pests including termites and cotton aphidAlready have more than 3000 registered avermetin-related products in China, passing the security check of AQSIQ (State General Administration of the People\x92s Republic of China for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine) Because the toxic proteins we use are recently discovered, few related researches can be found online.Moreover, we put the lrgA gene under the control of a weak and constitutive promoter  BBa_J23116 to in case of the leaky expression of the CidA to prevent cell lysis.In our project, we designed a device aiming at better controlling and killng termites.The training includes how to use the machine in our lab properly, how to react correctly if there happens to be an emergency and how to protect ourselves during the experiments.When we do something that is unsafe, he will point out and make sure that we won\x92t do it again.The Biobrick parts we have built have no safety issue according to our knowledge.In our plan, we shall build four constructs to express toxin proteins that help killing termites.When cultured with our IPTG-added medium, these bacteria would live as usual to function as a mini-factory to amplify plasmids or to produce plasmids for our use, whereas they would die due to the cell membrane lysis and genomic DNA release.This device is absolutely not allowed to be used outdoors, but is designed to be used in the house instead.Termite will be fed with these toxic proteins and death condition will be used to evaluate the toxicity.According to the chart we show below, we considered every aspect to confirm that our project are safe under given conditions..2.He teaches us how to do the experiment safely, and he will watch us to make sure that we all behave in the right way.After we designed the device, we are afraid that people might use it in a wrong way after they bought it.With regard to this CidA-LrgA system and the BNU iGEM 2014 kill switch design, we designed our own kill switch as the figure below shows.Time gradient experiments will be conducted to test how fast the proteins will start to degrade  -Proteins degradation rate will be tested under light, UV, high temperature and other conditions.-NMR will be used to detect proteins structure stability.We have a safety tutor in our lab.Gordon G D, Gordon J M.

uranium adsorption and recovery - we needed a protein polymer network which contains several functional modules.To address these drawbacks, the Peking iGEM team put forward the Uranyl Reaper project, which aimed to develop an innovative method to deal with uranium pollution.In order to achieve this goal, we designed an extraordinary biological adsorption polymer network which was produced by engineered bacteria and self-assembled completely autonomously.How to collect the protein polymer network together with the adsorbed uranyl from the environment?Impressively, in a trial where the concentration of uranyl was set at 10?M, the polymer network with the SUP module was able to sequester nearly 90% of total uranyl ions within just one minute.The fusion proteins could be brought to their working concentration by concentrating them directly in the culture supernatants, and the resulting crude concentrates could be used directly for the ultimate goal - the Uranium Reaper.Inspired by the autocatalytic formation of the isopeptide bond between a Lys and an Asp residue in the CnaB2 protein from S. pyogenes, researchers engineered a pair of complementary truncations of CnaB2, called SpyTag and SpyCatcher1.the results indicated that the crosslinking reaction between the Triple SpyCatcher and fusion proteins could be completed in 1 hour.Considering that uranium mainly exists as uranyl ion and its carbonate in aqueous solution, we applied the Super Uranyl Binding Protein (SUP), which was designed specifically to bind uranyl via structural calculation and functional modification.Finally, signal sequences derived from OmpA, LTIIb and PhoA were found to be efficient mediators for the secretion of our recombinant proteins.Whether in E. coli or B. subtilis, secretory proteins usually contain signal peptides that are essential for their export from the cytoplasm.Which signal peptide would best promote the secretion of our constructs was inscrutable, so a library was built in order to screen for the most suitable candidates.In view of existing as well as potential future uranium pollution, the current complicated, time-consuming, inefficient and expensive treatment methods seem woefully out-of-date.[1]Zakeri, B., et al., Peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein, through engineering a bacterial adhesin.A schematic graph of the whole project is shown in Fig.', 'human_practice': 'The Brochure designed for public education about the project, synthetic biology and iGEM.Additionally, we popularized iGEM among middle school students from the 2016 Peking University Alumni Children\x92s Summer Camp (Fig.After learning about the public opinion on uranium, uranium pollution, and synthetic biology, we decided to design a popular science brochure (Fig.Uranyl concentrations in water from Weiming Lake and in coal-washing wastewater  In order to assess whether there are potential dangers in our immediate vicinity, we extracted freshwater samples from Weiming Lake on campus and coal-washing wastewater from Shan Xi province, and measured the uranyl concentrations of the water samples by ICP-MS.It could thus be demonstrated that we had no need to worry too much about the effects of uranium pollution in daily life because the amount of uranium around us was within the normal range even in an otherwise quite polluted environment, such as around coal-mining operations.Additionally, we also measured the intensity of radiation in the nuclear environmental chemistry laboratory where we did the experiments with uranyl-containing solutions.), with the aim of helping them to develop a passion for biology, life sciences and synthetic biology.During this summer camp, there was a team coming to visit our lab and they were quite interested in the routine work of the iGEM team (Fig.In addition to the questionnaire survey and interviews of front-end units and experts, we have done more work related to social practice.Interestingly, the radiation intensity value in the work area was close to that determined in the playground, which could be regarded as the background value.Both were well within the drinking-water standard of the EPA which states that the amount of uranium shall not exceed 30 ?g/L, or about 126 nM1.', 'modeling': 'They made it a way to choose the monomers suitable for crosslinking reaction.The Peking iGEM Team has studied and expanded Paul J.

reaction system.But results were not useful, because there might be some noncovalent interactions between 3 kDa cutoff centrifuge filters and the molecular.Constructed additional three signal peptides Bpr, Epr and PelBTried to construct the expression vector in B.subtilis but all failedWe improved our experimental methods and supplemented equipment we needed.We had a great week in this meeting, in Sun Yat-Sen University, Guang Zhou, China.Constructed chromoproteins with the signal peptide, PhoA : Handed all the vectors with desired elements to the Test Group for examining the secretion

(Learn more) Demonstrated effective adsorption of uranyl ions by monomeric Triple SpyTag-SUP or polymer network containing the SUP module under a number of conditions.(Learn more) We visited experts from the College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and School of Physics of Peking University, respectively, to learn about the current situation surrounding uranium pollution in the real world and how people could control the situation.This way we could compare the methods they were using with the Uranium Reaper strategy.In the protein polymeric network, the concentration of enzymes could be increased and the efficiency of biocatalysis may consequently also be enhanced.If we optimize the number of SpyTag or SpyCatcher modules per protein monomer, as well as the working concentrations of proteins, we may make protein-3D printing using the Spy Crosslinking Network come true.Links to detailed lab results could also be found on these pages.We submitted 53 high-quality and well-characterized Standard BioBricks, including a set of derivatives of Triple SpyTag and Triple SpyCatcher, such as the Triple SpyTag-SUP and Triple SpyTag-mSA.We could thus also look into other usage scenarios of Uranium Reaper, such as bio-mining and uranium enrichment.Exchange of the SUP module for other functional proteins.(Learn more)Searched for methods and the best conditions for the extraction of each protein.In the future, we plan to optimize the entire Uranium Reaper strategy in order to enhance the adsorption efficiency.For an overall view of our project, please redirect to Overview Page or Design Page.The results were remarkable, clearly demonstrating that the Uranium Reaper strategy has much potential to be expanded to other heavy metals.(Learn more) We should reproduce all of the experiments that we have done this summer to make sure the results are credible.We will optimize the whole strategy to enhance the adsorption efficiency by changing pH, temperature, reaction time of crosslinking and clearance.(Learn more) Demonstrated a quick and stable crosslinking process of Triple SpyTag-SUP and Triple SpyTag-mSA with Triple SpyCatcher via covalent bonds.(Learn more) We did an interview with the Hunan Nuclear Geology 311 Brigade and gained thorough insights into the treatment of uranyl pollution used by the people on the firing line.(Learn more) We exchanged the Triple SpyTag-SUP monomer for Triple SpyTag-LBP or Triple SpyTag-CBP, and tried using the same strategy to adsorb lead and cadmium.(The efficiency is only about 60% without further optimization)According to the results for the adsorption of 13nM uranyl, the polymer network exhibited a good ability in a simulated seawater environment.(Learn more)We developed a special software which could be used to calculate the molecular weight distribution of protein polymers using Flory\x92s theory.', 'safety': 'We did not make any contact with genuine, and thus potentially dangerous, pollution samples from the field.Because the bacteria used to produce and secrete the proteins were sequestered in enclosed environments, such as fermenters, and we plan on only using the proteins instead of live bacteria to deal with pollution in the environment, we did not add a kill-switch in this project.What we did ourselves was only to use the simulated pollution scenes for the proof-of-principle test in the Bio-safety Level 2 iGEM lab, which means that we never made any contact with genuine, potentially dangerous pollution samples from the field.As mentioned above, the DNA parts are absolutely safe because they encode non-hazardous proteins such as SpyCatcher, SpyTag, SUP, mSA and their combinations.Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experimentThe original intention of the project was to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized material to deal with uranium pollution in the environment.The bench work followed some basic regulations as below:Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission was strictly prohibited.All involved participants needed to understand the experiment completely before commencing work.Any steps involving potential release of live microorganisms were performed in a bio-safety cabinet.Appliances such as Bunsen burners, electric heaters and microwave ovens were not left unattended while in use.All liquid and solid waste potentially containing living organism was sterilized.The entire lab was sterilized using UV-light every week.The last person to leave the lab always made sure that water, electricity, gas, and the air conditioner were shut down, and doors and windows have been locked before leaving.For the proof-of principle test, all uranyl solutions were prepared by specially trained professional researchers in the Nuclear Environmental Chemistry Group of Peking University.Additionally, the bacterial hosts are laboratory strains which are likely to be highly uncompetitive compared wild bacteria in the outside environment.During the utilization of the bio-functional polymer network, uranyl ions are enriched to a high concentration, which is a potential cause for concern.This year\x92s Peking iGEM Team is trying to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized biomaterial to deal with uranium pollution in the environment, using the methods of synthetic biology.In order to prove the usefulness of the concept, we did a series of experiments using simulated pollution scenes which were constructed by dissolving uranyl nitrate hexahydrate either in TBS buffer or in environmental water samples from the Weiming Lake on campus and the Bohai Sea.The strains are restricted to the lab so that the cells produce the Uranium Reaper system are continuously under rigorous control without any possibility to contact the outside environment.All media that had come in contact with bacteria were sterilized to prevent any escape of microbes.According to the requirements of iGEM policy we never performed any dangerous experiments in daily bench work or faced any unusual safety issues.The characteristics of these parts had been described in detail in previous work, and all part collections, such as the signal peptide library were derived from parts that are nonpathogenic and harmless to humans or the environment.Almost all the parts in the project were modified from pre-existing iGEM parts, such as SUP, LBP and so on.It is thus conclusive that none of the parts would raise any safety issues according to current professional knowledge.', 'keywords': 'TAT-Apoptin antibiotics mechanical encryption calcitonin LC-Cutinase fusicoccin tetracycline controlled polystyrene', 'track': 'Environment', 'part_favorite':

working for the UC Davis C-STEM Center.I am currently manager of the UC Davis Biomedical Engineering Molecular Prototyping and BioInnovation Lab.I joined iGEM for the experience of using biology to solve a real world problem.This summer I worked on several methods of quantifying the signal produced by our biosensor.This summer I produced an app that calculates your antimicrobial footprint and raises awareness about the unnecessary and potentially harmful ubiquity of antimicrobials in our environment.Hello, I am Logan Vinson a fourth year Genetics and Genomics major at UC Davis.University of California Davis, Department of Computer Science and UC Davis Genome Center My lab\x92s interests span a variety of topics related to evolutionary, synthetic and systems biology.Most recently I have worked on the redesign of naturally occurring enzymes for the degradation of immunogenic gluten proteins, to develop a novel CO2 fixation pathways, and design of a novel anthrax therapeutic.My name is Muntaha Samad and I am a third year at UC Davis studying Computer Science and Engineering.I decided to join iGEM, because I was interested in the engineering approach and view iGEM has towards biology.I contributed to the project mostly through outreach and wastewater collection.I have been an advisor to UC Davis iGEM teams for the past 5 years and have enjoyed every minute of it.I also assisted with hardware and hardware testing.University of California Davis, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and School of Medicine  My scientific efforts are focused on combining computational and experimental tools to develop a fundamental knowledge of enzyme catalysis, and applying those principles to design novel proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest.This summer I worked on the wet lab components of our project including experimental design and data analysis.Currently I am working with an international community on the development of Rosetta computational methodology for predicting and designing macromolecular structures, interactions, and functions.I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Biomedical Engineering and hope to one-day own my own biotechnology business.I am very interested in the engineering and design of power grids, as well as in transistor organization for processors and microprocessors.I also really enjoy robotics and am interested in pursuing a career working with smart prosthetics.I first found out about iGEM while i was at my junior college by my biology professor.I also contributed to the outreach of the project and sample collection.For this endeavor I worked closely with Gabe to first understand the biology behind our biosensor and then with various educators to figure out the most effective way to present this information.She told me about the competition after i had expressed interest in genetic manipulation and synthetic biology.My primary interest is to improve mentorship and educational opportunities for students interested in applications of systems and synthetic biology.I joined iGEM because I think there is a lot to learn from nature in designing more adaptive, resilient, and efficient systems.This summer I led our team\x92s efforts in exploring our problem space and iteratively refining our project goals.My current focus is on the design of novel biofuel and commodity chemical biosynthetic pathways, the development of novel therapeutics, and the general understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function.I enjoy working on problems that integrate computer science and biology, both hardware and software.I also created and delivered our presentation at the iGEM symposium with Gabe and put together this wiki.', 'background': '', 'description': 'They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme\x92s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan\x92s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan\x92s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303.It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water\x85Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samplesContinue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds\x85 or 1 60-fold)Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallelWhen we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan.In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!Triclosan\x92s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH.Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan.Cognizant of these two points, we developed an \x93antimicrobial awareness app\x94 to extend our solution more broadly.In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels).Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi!IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI.*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme.We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition dataTriclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3].Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28].As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI.We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water.However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and functionScience Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationshipsLearning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and functionIn regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:Providing a teacher\x92s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.These include a teacher s guide, classroom powerpoint, and assessment questions -- all of which can be downloaded below: Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting.The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally: be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae)."Kinetic and Structural Characteristics of the Inhibition of Enoyl (acyl Carrier Protein) Reductase by Triclosan."In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn\x92t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our projectOf the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18].From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI\x92s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19].Nature 485(7397): 185-194.Rodricks, Joseph V. "Triclosan: A Critical Review of the Experimental Data and Development of Margins of Safety for Consumer Products."This is why we needed to screen a panel of enzymes in order to find the enzyme most sensitive towards triclosan with a nanomolar inhibition constant.Characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosaenoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI): a target for the antimicrobial triclosan and its role in acylated homoserine lactone synthesis.Notwithstanding, NADPH is significantly more expensive than NADH[24], so instead of accommodating for S. aureus FabI, we decided to remove it from the FabI team.We were down to the "Fab 5".An alternative substrate was thus necessary for our biosensor to be used in a practical setting.To achieve our goal of developing a cost effective triclosan biosensor then, we were tasked with (a) discovering an enzyme that met all of our criteria and (b) identifying an alternative substrate that would enable practical use.(2001) 48 (1): 1-6. doi: 10.1093/jac/48.1.1[12] Mechanism and Inhibition of saFabI, the Enoyl Reductase from Staphylococcus aureus Hua Xu, Todd J.

a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.The second obstacle Ms. Moriarty mentioned are the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum.pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA.(2000) \x91Inhibition of InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by triclosan and isoniazid\x92,Biochemistry, Vol.We realized early on that if we wanted to promote responsible chemical use, we had to go about the issue responsibly ourselves.We found all living organisms except for the Archaea, who synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it\x92s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI\x92s from different organisms[5]."Structural basis for the variation in triclosan affinity to enoyl reductases."The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA\x92s role as an acyl carrier.Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are \x93good\x94 or \x93poor\x94 distractors, answer choices designed to test common misconceptions, and common statistics like the \x93facility factor\x94 and \x93discrimination factor\x94 that test how easy or hard a particular question is and how well a question help to discriminate different skill levels in a class, respectively.1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry (Bba_K771303), 3 FabI proteins taken from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae.To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution.We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum.We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae.[11] Courtney Slater-Radosti, Glenn Van Aller, Rebecca Greenwood, Richard Nicholas, Paul M. Keller, Walter E. DeWolf, Jr, Frank Fan, David J. Payne, and Deborah D. Jaworski Biochemical and genetic characterization of the action of triclosan on Staphylococcus aureus J.

Koenig, A. S. Beatty, Developing assessments for the next generation science standards (National Academies Press, 2014).Ref #.2 Russell, J.Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set.These require different assessment instruments.assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we\x92re interested in assessing but rather the student\x92s ability to decipher the questions.[22] Vick JE, Clomburg JM, Blankschien MD, Chou A, Kim S, Gonzalez R.Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) supports efficient operation of a functional reversal of ?-oxidation cycle.[18])We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI."Triclosan causes toxic effects to algae in marine biofilms, but does not inhibit the metabolic activity of marine biofilm bacteria.""Antimicrobial Spectrum of Triclosan, a Broad-spectrum Antimicrobial Agent for Topical Application.Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use.We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens.He gave us some insight:crafting \x93layered\x94 questions that assess different levels on Bloom\x92s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom\x92s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom\x92s questions might test a student\x92s ability to apply the core lessons to new situationsdifferent objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.We couldn\x92t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA.In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.Ms.To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout.We harkened back to Bruce Hammock\x92s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum\x92s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another.Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a \x93pre post test\x94.What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost.We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part.Percent inhibition was calculated by:The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme.Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute.Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents.100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADHWe are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen.To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid.This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.Dr."Triclosan Offers Protection against Blood Stages of Malaria by Inhibiting Enoyl-ACP Reductase of Plasmodium Falciparum."We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry!Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment?Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale.The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory.(2008) A pathogenic fungi diphenyl ether phytotoxin targets plant enoyl (acyl carrier protein) reductase.Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students.And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.We decided to use our device\x92s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion.[32] Bornscheuer, U.

W., J. Zheng, Y. M. Zhang and Rock (2005).The insights gained from these numerous conversations informed the shape and development of our lesson plan at multiple levels, including the teaching resources that are required to use it in the classroom.', 'design': 'They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme\x92s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan\x92s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan\x92s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303.It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water\x85Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samplesContinue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds\x85 or 1 60-fold)Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallelWhen we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan.In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!Triclosan\x92s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH.Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan.Cognizant of these two points, we developed an \x93antimicrobial awareness app\x94 to extend our solution more broadly.In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels).Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi!IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI.*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme.We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition dataTriclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3].Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28].As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI.We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water.However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and functionScience Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationshipsLearning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and functionIn regards to improving our lesson plan for wider acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:Providing a teacher\x92s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.These include a teacher s guide, classroom powerpoint, and assessment questions -- all of which can be downloaded below: Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting.The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally: be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae)."Kinetic and Structural Characteristics of the Inhibition of Enoyl (acyl Carrier Protein) Reductase by Triclosan."In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn\x92t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our projectOf the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18].From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI\x92s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19].Nature 485(7397): 185-194.Rodricks, Joseph V.

a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.The second obstacle Ms. Moriarty mentioned are the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum.pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA.(2000) \x91Inhibition of InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by triclosan and isoniazid\x92,Biochemistry, Vol.We realized early on that if we wanted to promote responsible chemical use, we had to go about the issue responsibly ourselves.We found all living organisms except for the Archaea, who synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it\x92s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI\x92s from different organisms[5]."Structural basis for the variation in triclosan affinity to enoyl reductases."The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA\x92s role as an acyl carrier.Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are \x93good\x94 or \x93poor\x94 distractors, answer choices designed to test common misconceptions, and common statistics like the \x93facility factor\x94 and \x93discrimination factor\x94 that test how easy or hard a particular question is and how well a question help to discriminate different skill levels in a class, respectively.1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry (Bba_K771303), 3 FabI proteins taken from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae.To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution.We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum.We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae.[11] Courtney Slater-Radosti, Glenn Van Aller, Rebecca Greenwood, Richard Nicholas, Paul M.

Beatty, Developing assessments for the next generation science standards (National Academies Press, 2014).Ref #.2 Russell, J.Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set.These require different assessment instruments.assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we\x92re interested in assessing but rather the student\x92s ability to decipher the questions.[22] Vick JE, Clomburg JM, Blankschien MD, Chou A, Kim S, Gonzalez R.Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) supports efficient operation of a functional reversal of ?-oxidation cycle.[18])We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI."Triclosan causes toxic effects to algae in marine biofilms, but does not inhibit the metabolic activity of marine biofilm bacteria.""Antimicrobial Spectrum of Triclosan, a Broad-spectrum Antimicrobial Agent for Topical Application.Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use.We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens.He gave us some insight:crafting \x93layered\x94 questions that assess different levels on Bloom\x92s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom\x92s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom\x92s questions might test a student\x92s ability to apply the core lessons to new situationsdifferent objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.We couldn\x92t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA.In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.Ms.To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout.We harkened back to Bruce Hammock\x92s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum\x92s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another.Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a \x93pre post test\x94.What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost.We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part.Percent inhibition was calculated by:The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme.Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute.Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents.100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADHWe are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen.To see if FabI could reduce the C-C double bond of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we tested crotonic acid.This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.Dr."Triclosan Offers Protection against Blood Stages of Malaria by Inhibiting Enoyl-ACP Reductase of Plasmodium Falciparum."We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry!Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment?Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale.The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory.(2008) A pathogenic fungi diphenyl ether phytotoxin targets plant enoyl (acyl carrier protein) reductase.Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students.And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.We decided to use our device\x92s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion.[32] Bornscheuer, U. T., G. W. Huisman, R. J. Kazlauskas, S. Lutz, J. C. Moore and K. Robins (2012).We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond.Human practice issues motivated our project and have informed its design every step of the way.This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences.To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.Ms.[28] Perozzo, R., M.

into 1.5 mL eppendorf microfuge tubes containing 1 mL of 25% glycerol cultures.We also did not transport any engineered strains outside of the lab, reducing the risk of release.Additionally, for application in the real world setting, future screening of alternate substrates would require us to look for substrates that are non hazardous to use outside of the laboratory setting.The colonies from the BLR strains showed recircularized plasmid while the DH10B strains showed proper gene insertion.Reactions were measured spectrophotometrically in either a Biotek plate reader or manually in

advice on biological techniques, methods, lab work and safety.', 'background': '', 'description': 'This protein, which is encoded by the nuclear MRPS12 gene (systematic name, YNR036C) is essential for the function of mitochondrial ribosomes and the synthesis of key components of the electron transport chain, without which, aerobic respiration is not possible.To test our idea, we modified the popular yeast expression vector, p416-GPD (Müller 120), by replacing the multiple cloning site with the BioBrick prefix and suffix (pSB416-GPD).However, a copper chelator like bathocuprione disulfonate could then be added to the system, to derepress the MRPS12 gene and allow aerobic respiration to begin again.Such a system could be employed during industrial fermentations.By disabling aerobic respiration, the yeast could begin generating secondary metabolites sooner and, therefore, might produce more over the course of their growth.We propose that the production of fermentation products and secondary metabolites could be optimized by purposefully regulating aerobic respiration during industrial fermentations.Additionally, if fermentation products could be consumed by the yeast, such a switch could prevent this consumption to increase yields (Aerts 115).We then used overlap assembly to clone a new translational unit (BBa_K1729001), including the wild-type Kozak sequence and a yeast codon-optimized MRPS12 gene, behind the GPD promoter.Ultimately, we envision controlling the expression of this gene with a repressible promoter such as that of the CTR1/3 system (Labbe 149).Therefore, when a higher concentration of copper is added to a culture, MRPS12 will not be expressed and aerobic respiration will not occur, forcing the cells into fermentative growth.', 'design': 'In order to avoid any potential conflicts, we started looking into new promoter systems that could potentially be used in our project.Our team found three new potential promoter systems that may be used in the project: MET-25, FET-3, and FIG-1.Created mini-preps and ran gels for a number of colonies, worked on project description.Week 5 This week focused on researching how our system could be used in industry and the details of the CTR-1 copper-repressible promoter system functions.Wrote the project description for the wiki and the iGem deadline, reviewed work left to do after week off.The team completed the project description and placed it on our wiki.Each promoter system was then discussed and thrown out due to issues with potential ligands needed to activate the systems and lack of information available that would prevent implementation.Upon continuing review, the team found a new promising promoter system using copper.In addition to the mRPS12 ORF construct, our team also designed and ordered a transcriptional unit to submit to the registry as a new part (construct 2 optimized).With this system, we would also need to utilize a construct consisting of a constitutive promoter (perhaps ADH1) and the TetR-VP64A coding region in order to produce the regulatory element (TetR-VP64A) required for the operator.We also started ideas for graphics that would be good to have on our presentation.Week 9 This week s design work focused on the presentation and poster, as well as discussing documentation for part submisson.We continued work on poster and presentation.Week 6This week focused on the documentation of the project (poster, presentation, and potential papers) and learning more about repressible promoter systems.Discussion on how to design the copper repressor began.Planned out experiment for cell number standard curves.The team discussed site directed mutigenesis for removing illgeal PstI site and removing a premature atg in our vector at the cleavage of the GPD promoter and the translation unit.The team ordered primers for the mutagenesis discussed on 8/4/15, discussed how to submit parts, and which parts go where, and how to document them.We started designing poster for giant Jamboree.The team discussed the creation of a new part, a modified version of the p416 plasmid which would be biobrick compatible and would be used in our experiments with our created translational unit.Discussions were conducted regarding how the experiments could be carried out and possible modeling that could be done.The team discussed possible papers to review for modeling yeast ethanol production with Dr. Goulet and read the user manual for the fluorescence reader for the ethanol assays.Week 7This week focused on learning about ethanol assays and how to use the fluorescence plate reader.We began working with the fluorescence plate reader in the Myers lab on campus.Additionally, we began consulting the literature to delineate the mechanism by which Mac1 protein interacts with the promoter.The team planned for our human practices project with the middle schoolers.We also began thinking about how we could analyze our data.Week 8This week focused on site-directed mutagenesis, the poster, and presentation for the Giant Jamboree.Sent off a set of DNA for sequencing.We decided on a project, set goals, and started designing parts.Our team spent time discussing project ideas, establishing the overall goal to create an on/off \x93switch\x94 for the mitochondria in S. cerevisiae.Additionally, this motif suggests that it is cleaved off in a two step cleavage event by mitochondrial processing peptidase and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase.The team conducted a literature review to understand the genes encoded by the mitochondrial DNA in order to assess which proteins would no longer be translated as a result of the inactivation of mrps12.From the literature review, we found that some components of the electron transport chain and proteins involved in the krebs cycle would no longer be translated due to this inactivation.We decided to continue research into this system as it is the most promising we have found.Week 3 This week s focus was the Human Practices portion of our project.Additionally, the team began to plan out the experiments for our ethanol assays.Upon further looking into the tet-o system we found that there may have been potential copyright issues with using a tet-o system for our project.We discussed track selection further and began discussing, in depth, the roles our project may play in a manufacturing setting.This system will be used to explain the basic components in a general sense to the group before having them delve into the more advanced challenges.Today the team had its synthetic biology education seminar with the middle schoolers.We started to review the content written for the poster and plan the graphics that will accompany/replace the text currently there.The team further discussed the protocol and necessary lab work for the ethanol assays which we will be conducting.We are still unsure of what assembly method to use to create this modified plasmid.Our team started today by having a meeting to establish what needed to be finished for the week\x92s end, as well as goals for the following week.The team then switched gears and wrote up our summary of our human practices events from the previous week as well as wrote a preliminary draft of our project description.Overall, the meeting was incredibly helpful in seeing the larger process to which our system fits and how our system may affect various aspects of that process.Begun work on building the copper repressor part by assembling in silico the sequence for CTR1p with +/- 1kb up or downstream of the ORF as found on SGD.Today our team began discussing methods for visualizing yeast mitochondria as well as methods for comparing the mitochondria between the on and off states.Each group was able to complete the challenges in a reasonable amount of time and were able to explain the purpose of each part in the biological circuit that they had constructed.Week 4This week revolved around researching leader sequences and how regulating MRPS12 might affect growth and production of fermentation products.It was also realized that the MRPS12 ORF part order previously (construct 1) was designed with the prefix for non-coding regions rather than the prefix for coding regions, and must be reordered with the correct prefix sequence.Lastly, we found that a base concentration of 16nM of copper is necessary for the function of the promoter and the repression occurs around a copper concentration of 1µM.started idea on a potential model, which would be related to the amount of copper needed to activate/deactivate gene.We learned of various products that the general idea of our system may be used, including, ethanol, vanillin, indigo, etc.The team created a first draft of the written content for the introduction, application, and human resources portions of the poster.Began work on the presentation at the Giant Jamboree, including an outline of content as well as rough drafts of diagrams.There are three possible promoters to use the two repressible CTR1 and CTR3 promoters and the inducible CUP1 promoter.We discussed an outline for our parts documentation and submission status to the registry.We looked into the equipment that would be needed for our ethanol assays.This part will be used as our new BioBrick part for the second silver medal requirement.al (1997) as the CTR1 promoter as well as the CuRE transcript elements within this region were also identified.The activation of the system involves a binding event between the CuREs, Mac1 protein, and copper.Today\x92s focus was on the background biology and considering how much of it was needed for the jamboree, considering the significant biological background that attendees will have.We continued work on poster and presentation.This system would be regulated using varying sugars in the media.CTR3 was reintroduced as a possibility after concern over a transposon in the wild type CTR3 promoter was dismissed.Thus, we chose to proceed with the CTR1 promoter.We also discussed Kozak sequences and determined that the Kozak sequence listed on the registry on the yeast page is actually the mammalian sequence.We planned and held three seminars for middle school summer campers on campus.We decided on continuing our examination of literature about the CTR1 and CTR3 promoter systems.We also selected information sections that would be put onto the poster.Work continued on the poster and graphics.The team typed up preliminary drafts for the documentation of the parts which we will be submitting to the iGEM parts database.The safety page for the wiki was written by the team.This part consists of the optimized mRPS12 ORF following the native Kozak sequence.A 64bp region in the promoter region of the CTR3 gene was identified as the minimally required loci for the promoter to respond to copper input and function correctly.This composite part was also flanked by 30 nucleotide overhangs homologous to the registry\x92s prefix and suffix.Secondary metabolites is a significant portion that we wanted to address, since production of the metabolites are the primary use of fermentation in industry.We were able to find the user manual for the machine and the software user manual allowing us to gain an understanding of how to use the machine for our experiments.The proteins involved in entry are mitochondrial peptidases for cleaving the signal peptidase after entry and various TIM and TOM proteins that mediate entry.We compared the four cleavage motifs for mitochondrial peptidases with our sequence and matched our leader sequence with the R-10 cleavage motif.Lastly, our team discussed possibilities for promoters that could be used for our translational unit and concluded that a tetracycline operator system (TetO) could be useful for regulation of our construct.The first will be composed of the wild type mRPS12 sequence, preceded by the native Kozak sequence.We plan on introducing them to synthetic biology and the idea of how genes are turned into proteins.We brainstormed potential questions from judges about any information thus far selected.Prepared for the creation of the mitochondrial localization sequence for submission to the database.The TET system was investigated by our team as a potential candidate for an on/off switch.The mRPS12 ORF was then flanked by 30 nucleotide overhangs homologous to the prefix and suffix listed in the registry to allow for insertion into pSB1C3 via homologous recombination.Primary discussion revolved around color scheme and graphics for the poster.The R-10 motif suggests that localization of mrps12 would occur in either the inner mitochondrial matrix or the mitochondrial matrix.We began discussing possibilities for parts submissions, including the ORF for mRPS12, a promoter, and a reporter.The students enjoyed the presentation and activity and were extremely interested in learning about synthetic biology and the field of biology in general.In order to assess the application of our product more effectively we decided to meet with other faculty at Rose-Hulman with experience in industry using yeast for industrial processes.Team arranged meeting with Dr. Serbezov to understand the industrial roles of yeast more effectively.The team met with Dr. Serbezov and, an incoming professor, Dr. Reizman in order to discuss the manufacturing application of our system.Week 2 This week was primarily focused on finding a system to act as a  switch  to turn the gene on and off.We also began planning out new partsThe team began a literature review regarding leader sequences and their function for mrps12.', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': '', 'notebook':

'background': '', 'description': '2) occurs inBased on the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP in the pathways mentioned above, GPP synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation between IPP and DMAPP to synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the burden for E. coli, so in our research, we transferred both GPPS gene and LS gene into theIn our project we decided to use E. coli, MEP pathway to express limonene.We then add 5?L 5% limonene (T) and DMSO (C) respectively at the two small circular filters in the experimental groups(Fig.This proves that many terpenes can attract plant-parasitic nematodes in naturalSome researches showed that limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\x92s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many kinds of volatiles to induce nematodes that are harmful to these predators.We put two small pieces of circular filter paper 2.5cm from the center of the circle (Fig.Later we add 30?L suspension of the nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\xa0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.', 'design': 'First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\x92s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.The fourth area is made up of a cuboid outer shell, which can support the device.The figure above shows our product \x96 Device 1.0.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.This change fulfills our aim to save money and energy, which is also more economical and enviromentally friendly.As shown above, device 2.0 has two shells \x96 an outer shell and an inner shell.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.The third area is light controlling area, which includes a LED light.When it is turned on, red emission will activate the promoter and bacterial cells will express attracting substance; while the LED light is turned off, toxalbumin will be produced.', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'To make the project applicable in real life, we designed a device with modified engineering bacteria inside, which can be placed in soil to attract and kill nematodes.Assuming there is a farmland, we took advantage of gas diffusion and nematodes\x92 movement analogue simulation to find the best position for the device to be placed.We established a database to broaden the scope of our applications, combined with our methods, to kill more different pests.Additionally, it takes time for nematodes to reach the device, so we can determine the distance between the devices we place according to the three-day-period and the crawl speed of nematodes.Let L be the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment, V is nematodes\x92 crawl speed, and T is time nematodes need to develop into adult.Firstly, we considered a square farmland, to minimize the number of equipment we use, the arrangement mode of equipment is as follows (firstly, we consider the situation with four devices arranged together).As shown above, the white circles represent the devices of colon bacillus, while the bigger circles represent diffusion, with the same odorousness in a circle.Our modeling process is given below:Nematodes can be attracted if the attraction concentration of limonene is higher than the lowest attractant concentration and then can move towards the direction of the highest odor concentration after attracted by the limonene smell[4].Engineering bacteria in our device are able to produce enough limonene as we need.Nematodes move on a 2D plane.The rules of the movement are as follows:The nematodes move towards 4 different directions: front, behind, right and left;Every time the nematode choose one of the 4 directions randomly and the probability of these 4 directions are the same;If the nematode move to the place where the gas concentration is lower than the previous position, then the nematode will move back to the previous position.We did the different simulation experiments with one device in the farmland and four devices in the farmland separately.In order to apply our hypothesis and methodology to more agricultural pests control, we established a database.And we can achieve remote control by using radio technology.With these improvements to our device, we want to figure out how we can put our technology into practice in farmland, and whether our device would be more efficient and economical than the methods used currently used in killing nematodes (crop-dusting mostly).In order to meet the lowest attractant concentration, the concentration of limonene produced by every device should be (24.8 g/cm^3).The explanations of simulation: In the video above, we built up a simulation model of the movement of nematodes using the cellular automaton in MATLAB.Based on the longest distance between nematodes and the equipment which has been acquired in the first question, we obtain:Considering that odorousness will be reduced with the increase of distance away from the device, we should only consider about the superposed odorousness at point F(considering four equipment now) to reach the lowest attractant concentration.We set the attraction time as 3 days and the distance between two devices is 100 m. As the evenly distribution of nematodes is from 5 cm to 15 cm underground, we put the device into the place which is 10 cm underground.In order to answer these two questions, especially the second one, we need to conduct a simulation of the movement of nematodes to determine the most suitable place in the farmland to place our device.In matrix A, we assume that the device is put on row i and column j (i, j).In the video, we showed the movement of a nematode that we separated from soil from Hebei Province, China.After discussion among team members about device 1.0, we found several deficiencies.It shows how nematode moves in a real farmland with the device.We hope this new environment-friendly method, based on principles of synthetic biology, could be shared with and improved by the researchers all over the world.In order to enable our project to be applied in real environment, we designed and made Device 1.0.Because the movement range of nematodes is within 10cm and the distance between two devices is much longer than 10cm, we can ignore the depth.When the gas diffuses in space, the concentration is not affected by temperature, aerodynamics or other factors.The device emits gas continuously and the concentration is uniform in space.And after the gas diffusion, the attractant concentration will stabilize.Considering that we need to control the density of nematodes in a proper range, we hope to do this by killing all the mature nematodes within certain period of time under the identical condition.(2i+1)(2sqrt{Dt})^{2i+1}}) end{array} end{equation}This is the schematic diagram of our device in a 300m × 300m farmland according to results of simulation.First of all, the size of our device is so limited that the reaction substrate (limestone and diluted hydrochloric acid) is not enough to generate CO2 constantly.There are tiny holes on the outer shell, which allow nematodes to enter the device.We have simulated our device in the lab and our results show that our system is able to work under real-world conditions.There are 8 steps to apply our device in farmland as shown in the video above.Thus we obtain:Where C1 is the superposed odorousness diffused from the device, C0 is the lowest attractant concentration.According to Fick s Law, We obtain a 3-D gas diffusion model.After 3 hours of incubation, we took out the device and removed the slide glasses.Step 8.Meanwhile, our device has been shaped to sphericity too, and the LED light has been moved to the center so that the whole surface can get the radiation evenly.Indeed, we need to further improve our device.Firstly, we assume that engineering bacteria can produce ideal concentration of attractant and toxalbumin (the ideal concentration is in reasonable range).Orientation of the entomogenous nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae to carbon dioxide[J].Its mathematical expression is as follows:$$frac{partial C(t,x)}{partial t} = D_{A}frac{partial ^2 C(t,x)}{partial x^2}$$C(x,t) is the concentration at the distance of X from gas source in t, N0 is the concentration of gas source, D is the diffusion coefficient.According to the model above, we obtain the gas diffusion model in 3D.The red LED light can be supplied with the power from solar power pane, which will be put on the surface of the farmland.And we found that the Meloidogyne needs 8.5d-10.5d to develop into second instar larvae from monoplast egg according to an exiting literature[9].And according to the principle of isotropy, we simplify the problem in 1D.We build a gas diffusion model to calculate the gas concentration at each point in matrices.Since the three dimensions have no difference between each other, we simplify the question into a 1-D situation according to isotropy.According to Fick s Law, points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of x Since the three dimension has no difference between each other, we simplify the question into 1-D situation according to isotropy.A brief introduction to the Fick s Law: It points out that during the process of unsteady diffusion, at a distance of X, the change rate of concentration to time is equal to the negative value of the change rate of diffusion flux to distance.Then, considering the problem of space utilization rate and the fact that E.coli can only grow on the surface of the medium, we changed the medium\x92s shape to sphericity to reach the highest space utilization percentage.We will update relevant information about the engineering bacteria we designed to kill the pests in our database.Currently, our database contains the biobrick we established in this project and the one established by team ZJU-CHINA.All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!All the users have the permission to edit and add new contents, and we welcome everyone to use and enrich our database!Liang W, Li Q, Chen L, et al.The proportion of virtual nematode and real nematode is 0.0084.The nematodes is distributed randomly at the beginning.It\x92s obvious that in this farmland (do not consider points on the sides of the square), point F is the farthest point away from the four equipment.We also demonstrated how to use red LED light in the video.Step 7.And the procedures below were conducted in a fume hood.Step 3.What\x92s more, squares ABCD are the simplified farmland.We choose low-cost CO2 as our assistant attracting substance since it was demonstrated that carbon dioxide has a function of attracting nematodes[1-3].Our device has four areas.We will attract nematodes into our device in time d and kill them in time d. We found that all nematodes are killed after two \x93slaughters\x94.Secondly, the space utilization percentage is low on the slide medium; as a result, the production of both attractant and toxalbumin is low.We hope to take a better use of this new environmental-friendly method from the context synthetic biology and share it with researchers all over the world.Because the productivity of attracting substance by E.coli is limited and the price of man-made attracting substance is quite high.We opened the faucet of the separating funnel in order to let HCl flow into the test tube under the atmospheric pressure.In device 2.0, we improved device 1.0 in those three aspects mentioned above.Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on nematode trophic groups in a Chinese paddy-field ecosystem[J].Ye H Y, Ye B P, Wang D Y. Molecular control of memory in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans[J].This change fulfills our aim to save money and energy, which is also more economical and enviromentally friendly.As shown above, device 2.0 has two shells \x96 an outer shell and an inner shell.', 'notebook': 'The goal of our modeling project is to give a best attractant of concentration so that we can determine the most economical plan.We prepared the L-limonene and D-limonene and the synthases expression E. coli (BL21,pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) without standardization of them both, which were cryopreserved with glycerol.We prepared the BW25113 competent cells in terms of the component efficiency kit, and we detected their efficiency of transformation by transforming rfp-PSB1C3 plasmids of different concentration into the cells.We transformed pSB1C3-rMpL into BW25113 competent cells to cultivate on the LB plate and inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the obtained monoclonal colony to produce bacteria solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We revived the limonene synthases expression E. coli strain preserved in glycerol.We assembled bace16-pSB1C3 and transformed it into E. coli DH5?.And we processed nematodes\x92 chemotaxis replication experiment of limonene as well.We also did expression replication experiments by doing SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample) which came out an obvious band (89kd).We ensured the empty vector plasmid was correct with three groups of restriction digestion.We repeated the induction experiment with different concentration gradient of arabinose as before, while we just collected the precipitation without extracting proteins this time.We built a device all by handwork!We inoculated 10 mL centrifuge tubes with the monoclonal colony to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction, and we named the obtained plasmid pUC57-rMpL.We digested the plasmid PSB1C3-RFP sent by iGEM and the pUC57-rMpL with restriction enzyme separately and obtained the PSB1C3 backbone and rMpL gene segment which were connected together later on to assemble the plasmid PSB1C3-rMpL.Together with members majoring in physics, mathematics and biology, we drafted an abstract settlement concentrating on how to simulate the concentration of nematodes in chemotaxis.And we sent plasmids extracted this time for sequencing.We re-prepared the homogenate of the revived E. coli-BL21(pGEX-4T-1-sls-gpps) for SDS-PAGE and enlarge cultivated the standard bacteria (BL21-pSB1c3) transformed the second time to express the objective product.We transformed bace16-pSB1C3 into the newly obtained BW25113 competent cells to express for another time, and examined the result with SDS-PAGE.We went on the expression experiment of rMpL as above except that we added parallel controll groups whereas canceled the control ones expressed under 37C and prolonged the expression period.After the result of digestion exam was correct we extracted the plasmid and did sequencing, and we transformed the plasmid with correct sequence into E. coli BW25113 to establish expression strain.We activated the preserved culture and enlarge cultivated it in 250 mL conical flask, inducting expression with different concentration gradient of L-arabinose, we collected the precipitation after centrifuging the bacteria solution.Additionally, we learned the life history, growth properities and feeding method of nematodes.We prepared nematodes for enlarge cultivation and induced expression of the LS expression E. coli, and we synchronized a batch of nematodes for verification.We digested rfp-pSB1C3 with two isocaudamas Spe I and Xba I and prepared empty vector plasmid as negative control of whether the desired gene expressed.Since we could get the solution of best concentration of attractant and the diffusion of nematodes, we decided to go towards a further step.We transformed into E. coli DH5? the bace16-pSB1C3 to find that the result of plasmid extraction and enzyme digestion was correct, thus we confirmed the problem was from the expression strain.We re-cultivated the collected bacteria and mixed up the recombined bacteria with the control ones to a certain scale (1:4) to coat on NGM medium, preparing for nematodes cultivation of toxic test.Another important module of our project is to build a database which researchers and even farmers can get information of bio-pesticide easily.Then we recycled the backbone and gene segments following the agarose gel DNA extraction kit and linked them to produce plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3 and d-limonene-pSB1C3.We continued to watch the movement of nematodes under toxic test, where the nematodes of M9 group was generally active, partly died of bace16 and heated bace16 groups, and acted normally in pSB1C3 group.Another SDS-PAGE of extracellular proteins extract was run while the objective band was still not observed.However, we still failed to observe obvious expression of rMpL, against which we suspected there occurred something wrong with the expression bacteria and planed to change bacteria strain to express de novo.We put the database on the github.com and it can be edited and added new items by all users.We transferred plasmids with correct sequenced d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS gene into expression strain E. coli BL21 respectively to express LS and GPPS.The problem was confirmed to be from the expression strain as mentioned above, so we adopted a new strain of BW25113 and continued our experiment.We enlarge cultivated the standard LS expression bacteria (E. coli-BW2513-pSB1C3) and expressed the objective produce (in contrast with empty vector).Congratulations!We tried some simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation to be familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We designed parts rMpL and bace16 by adding pBAD promoter (BBa_K206000) and RBS(BBa_B0034) to the upstream region of rMpL gene and bace16 gene, and we committed the GENEWIZ company to synthesize the rMpL and bace16 gene segment.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.So we re-transformed the plasmids from the company into E. coli DH5?and BL21 separately and did all the cultivation, plasmid extraction, enzyme digestion de novo to make sure the examine result correct.The results of SDS-PAGE suggested that d&l-limonene synthase and GPPS were expressed successfully.Incubate the bacteria with 8 (mu)M, 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose , run SDS-PAGE after ammonium sulfate precipitation.Change the E. coli strain to express rMpL, only add 10 (mu)M and 12 (mu)M arabinose for incubation this time.To test if rMpL is expressed in the pallet or the supernatant, ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to enrich the protein.using Ultrasonication and SDS-PAGE are also used during this process.This week we discussed factors that would influence the putting model of equipment on the farmland.So we extracted the bace16-pSB1C3 from the expression strain BW25113 for restriction enzyme digestion and no objective band was extracted still.We inoculated the obtained monoclonal colony into 10 mL centrifuge tubes to produce bacterium solution for plasmid extraction, the enzyme digestion result of which was incorrect that a band around 500~750 bp appeared whereas the backbone band lost.We examined the extracted plasmid with enzyme digestion, no objective band observed as a result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry powder.However, we regrettably observed that the effect of expression is not ideal from the SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis of both the homogenate and the supernatant.We realized that our original assumption that we regarded nematodes as static models couldn t react to some essential properties of nematode moving.We transformed the plasmid rfp-pSB1C3(BBa_J04450) in DH5? and proceeded amplification to obtain the standard plasmid backbone.We prepared some common used reagent such as TAE, antibiotics and LB cultural medium.Modeling group members read some related materials and papers, including wikis of former teams especially their modeling parts as well as papers introducing nematodes.We extracted the plasmid and did restriction enzyme digestion to test and verify the plasmid backbone PSB1C3, and preserve the correct plasmid for subsequent experimental use.We designed the sequence of Limonene synthase (LS) that would be transformed to E. coli to express.Our designed sequences were based on the two cDNA sequences of LS expression sequence--Citrus unshiu CitMTSE1 for d-limonene synthase and Mentha spicata 4S-limonene synthase, together with prefix and suffix codes and restriction enzyme cutting site were sent to the company for optimum synthesis.We obtained the plasmid of gene rMpL with PUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.The results verified that compound limonene could attract nematodes preliminarily.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria of experimental group and control group.We did SDS-PAGE under the protocol mentioned above (reserve the homogenate as protein sample), no significant difference observed between the bands.In addition, the differences between bands of BW25113 and BL21 were obvious when ran SDS-PAGE together whereas the objective band of BW25113 couldn t be ensured.We expressed bace16 protein twice and prolonged the expression period to overnight.At the same time, we carried out the experiment of attractive interactions of limonene towards nematodes several times.Third, we had built a basic frame of the database.Sequencing gene l-limonene and d-limonene synthesized by the company to get an unsatisfactory result, we speculated that these plasmids were extracted from the wrong BW25113.Also we improved our device and made a 3D model of it, which we called Device 2.0.To verify whether limonene had been synthesized by bacteria, the fermentation broth was tested by GC-MS in School of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University.According to pair t test, we concluded that limonene could attract nematodes.According to the original paper, rMpL is soluble protein expressed inside the cell, so target protein should be still in pallets.The correct plasmids examined with restricton enzyme digestion was preserved in -20°, named l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57.We digested the plasmid pSB1C3-RFP from iGEM as well as l-limonene-PUC57 and d-limonene-PUC57 separately with restriction enzymes to get pSB1C3 backbone and the two gene segments, among which the brightness of pSB1C3 backbone band was quite weak.That\x92s why we had to make it by hands.We tried another protocol of replication experiment as increasing the amount of sample whereas the effect was still not ideal indicated by the statistical result.We obtained gene l-limonene and d-limonene connected with pUC57 backbone in the form of dry power.Considering there are so many factors can\x92t be predicted in the real situation, we talked about how to idealize and simplify our putting model.In order to testify if engineering bacteria have the ability to express limonene, amplification cultured bacteria liquid covered with n-hexane was cultured in the shaking table to express production.Inhibition is observed on the plate inoculated with recombinat bacteria.Through a lot of discussion among our group, and with accumulating realization and knowledge of this program, we finally came up with a method to solve the problem of how to place equipment we made on the farmland.We optimized the protocol of replication experiment on and on, and the growth condition of nematodes is favorable.Finally, we chose traditional technology to produce devices in the future if it was verified that our device had high value of application.At the same time, we make the model revision.Run SDS-PAGE and get bands which might be rMpL.Cultivate C. elegans larva after synchronization on the NGM medium with bacteria.Still, we failed to observe objective band at all the supernatant of bacteria, homogenate and supernatant of ultrasonic broken cells.We induced expression of rMpL continuously with arabinose in concentration gradient to acquire a stable expression condition.Meanwhile, it appeared to be some problems of other groups\x92 digestion too, against which we speculated that the cause may be the pollution of reagent, star activity or something wrong with the expression strain.GENEWIZ gave us the relevant feedback in time and modified the two sequences to synthesize again.We did the simple experimental operation such as the enlarge culture of bacteria, culture preservation and transformation again to be further familiar with the laboratory apparatus and the solexa.We started to work on it.We transformed the obtained plasmids l-limonene-pSB1C3?d-limonene-pSB1C3 into E. coli BW25113 and cultivated 10mL centrifuge tube with them to produce bacterium solution for preservation and plasmid extraction.We found the gene sequence of bace16(AAV3D0845) and the cDNA sequence of MpL(GeneBank accession number HQ449739) from the Genebank, and optimized the coded sequences in E. coli.After we determined the theme of our project, we recuited more undergraduates from related colleges, including college of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.Second, the device we had made actually was not applicable enough, which required further improvement.No positive results are observed in 4 days.Cultivate recombinant bacteria, bacteria with empty vector or OP50 bacteria for nematoxicity test of rMpL protein.As we discussed the influencing factors last week, our main work this week was to search documents to see what exact influence these factors would bring to our result, and whether these factors can be ignored or idealized.After being amplification cultured and expressing aiming products, the bacteria were smashed by ultrasonication.However, the cost of product by 3D print is too high.We also transferred empty pSB1C3 plasmids into expression strain E. coli BL21 and regarded them as the control group.Finally our plan is to design and build a debug device.We cultivated nematodes and proceeded synchronization, and we did replication experiment of baiting nematodes with linalool using pure chemical compound (linalool).', 'protocol': 'Incubate upside down at 37°C overnight.Flush nematodes from the plate with M9, centrifugate (1500 r.p.m, 3min), abandon the supernatant and resuspend the precipitation with 3mL M9.Add 500(mu)L resuspended solution to the NGM plate inoculated with mixed E.coli as mentioned above as experimental group and NGM plate with blank E.coli as control group.Make 3 repeats of each concentration.Flush nematode from the plate with M9 and inoculate 20 (mu)L (about 30 nematodes) into the center of the medium.Inoculate 5mL LB liquid mediums added Chl with experimental group E.coli BW25113 (transformed with rMpl or bace16 genes) and blank control group separately.37°C incubate overnight.Observe and compare the activation and size of nematodes of each group and draw a conclusion.Autoclave the above mentioned reagents with 120°C for 30 min and then water bath them to 65°C.Add 1ml cholesterol, CaCl2, MgSO4 and 25 mL phosphoric acid buffer into the minimum medium in order (all at 65°C, shake up).Streak inoculate OP50 on LB solid medium, Incubate at 37°C for 6 hr or overnight.Incubate at 37°C, 190 r.m.p for 3 hr.Mix up 800(mu)L control group and 200ul experimental liquid medium Inoculate 1mL mixture mentioned above to NGM plate.Insert a comb to create sample pockets.After the stacking gel also polymerized, 1 x running buffer is used to run the Double Gel System via the SDS gel.Dissolve the compounds with DMSO to set a series of concentration gradient of attractant.Divide the NGM solid medium (d = 6 cm) equally into two parts (drawing on the surface of the culture dishes).Put 50 (mu)L compound of different concentration and DMSO as contrast respectively on the two parts.Cut down a square of NGM(about 1cm x 1cm) with nematodes.Put the square on the NGM medium with OP50 and let the surface with nematodes adown to contact the medium.Watch the growth condition of nematodes under the stereoscope everyday and re-inoculate every 4 to 5 days to avoid the nematodes growing too densely.For inoculating abundant nematodes rapidly, or changing plate to provide more food and better condition for them, we can flush them with M9 and centrifuge them with 1500 r.m.p for 1 min, and incubate the precipitate on a new plate.Grow slowly at 16°C and grow fast at 25°C while egg laying amount declines.Inoculate NGM medium with 150~200 (mu)L OP50, incubate at 37°C for 12hr.', 'result': '2) occurs inBased on the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP in the pathways mentioned above, GPP synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation between IPP and DMAPP to synthesize GPP, and then Limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the intramolecularIn E. coli, the levels of intracellular GPP expression are very limited, which will hinder the expression of increase the burden for E. coli, so in our research, we transferred both GPPS gene and LS gene into theIn our project we decided to use E. coli, MEP pathway to express limonene.We then add 5?L 5% limonene (T) and DMSO (C) respectively at the two small circular filters in the experimental groups(Fig.This proves that many terpenes can attract plant-parasitic nematodes in naturalSome researches showed that limonene is a kind of volatile that attracts nematodes such as TylenchulusLimonene is a kind of terpenoids (isoprenoids), and the precursor of limonene is geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).If in the verification experiment limonene attracts nematodes, the module we build can be used to attract nematodes successfully.After that, we used the ultrasonication method to make E. coli homogenate and did SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the expression of the synthases.After the successful expression of the synthases, we did GC-MS to identify the expression of limonene.First we dilute the limonene by DMSO and the final concentration of the limonene is 5%.As for the control groups, both of the two small circular filters are added 5?L DMSO (Fig.IPP and DMAPP are the two essential building blocks to synthesize all terpenoids[3].As the limonene was expressed, we tried to verify the limonene\x92s attractivity to nematodes.We divided the NGM medium dish into two even parts and drew a circle of 1cm diameter at the center of the plate.roots that infected by weevil larvae than uninfected plants[1], which proves that the terpene secreted by the infected plants could attract some kinds of parasitic nematodes.In our research, limonene is expressed as a kind of bait to attract plant-parasitic nematodes as its special flavor could drawThere are researches showing that when plants are infected by herbivore insects, they will secrete many kinds of volatiles to induce nematodes that are harmful to these predators.We put two small pieces of circular filter paper 2.5cm from the center of the circle (Fig.Later we add 30?L suspension of the nematodes at the center of the plate and cultivate them in the incubator under 20? for 1 hour.4B) to eliminate the influence of the position of the nematodes.3).Our verification experiment was divided into two types of groups -- the experimental groups and the control groups.After the nematodes move dispersedly, we put the plate into the 4?\xa0refrigerator for 1 hour until the move of the nematodes slows down.We observed the distribution of the nematodes and counted the number of the nematodes.It is also used in the production of several commodity chemicals and medicinal compounds[4].We transferred plasmids into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to make it express a normally plant-expressed monoterpene: limonene.Limonene is a kind of valuable terpenoids (isoprenoid) normally expressed in plants, especially in citrus and mentha plants.After that, we did a statistic analysis to confirm the attractive function of limonene towards the nematodes.', 'safety': 'In addition, we established a photoinduced bidirectional transcription system regulated by light, where we can divide the process of attracting and killing nematodes into two periods to realize the relatively timing and quantitative release of the toxic proteins, bringing down the retention in the environment.Thirdly, a suicide system was constructed based on the principles of quorum sensing in microorganisms which would enable us to control the bacterial colony density artificially and therefore the quantity of engineering bacteria can be maintained in a stable and controllable range.Considering the biosafety, we improved device 2.0 into a relatively closed unit, and we also designed a dome to cover the medium.(Fig.1)We replaced GFP and RFP with limonene synthase and toxic protein respectively, so the release of the two proteins can be regulated by gp35 directly, and by light signals indirectly.Generally speaking, the Switch system works in this way--provide the system with light of wavelength in 600nm at first so gene gp35 will be repressed and the system will express the chemical attractants like limonene.In conclusion, the significance of our system is that we have built a photoinduced bidirectional system to avoid a simultaneous and strong expression of the bait and toxic proteins, in which way we can avoid the potential harm done to environment by the system.We not only considered the potential safety problem caused by the high expression of the toxic protein and attractant, but also designed a suicide system for our engineering bacterias to solve the problem by regulating the population size of our bacterias.We built our system based on the phenomenon of quorum sensing[1].In addition, replacement as well as remove of medium and engineering bacteria would all be done in the labs or safety rooms of factories which guarantee relative closure of the device used in farmland and avoid engineering bacteria spreading.Although Bace16 and rMpL are both toxic proteins towards nematodes specially, the over expression of these proteins can also break the ecological equilibrium inevitably.While when the concentration of attractants reaches a certain point (see modeling part), we would turn off the light to trigger the expressing of protein gp35 to push the system work in a reverse direction so that the toxic protein would be expressed.In addition, after the engineering bacteria works, the device would be recycled and the residual bacteria would be disinfected.3.Is it safer, cheaper, or better than other technologies that do the same thing?We concluded the action objects and disadvantages of various traditional nematicides of China according to related literatures, and the result is shown below.High toxicity Do harm to the soil, the environment even the health.This complex can bind with promoter luxpR, after which the transcription of mazf gene in the downstream will be triggered and bacterias will be killed by toxin protein MazF[2].Firstly, we designed a device to cultivate E.coli inside and restricted their movement at the same time, thus preventing the difussion of our engineering bacteria to soil.Will it be sterilized, discarded, or recycled?Our device is designed to be recyclable so the growing state can be checked at regular intervals, which means once something wrong happens, we can adjust the bacterial colony timely.With the biosynthesis of PCB, Cph8 can serve as a photoreceptor that regulates gene expression through PompC.In order to regulate the direction of promoter J23110 under the light signal, an integrase, gp35, is added to the upstream region of the PompC promoter.We constructed two main circuits.When gp35 expresses, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.Cph1 is a member of the plant photoreceptor family.As for environmental safety, on one hand, we design a semi-closed device to avoid the spread of engineering bacterias in which way we could increase the safety level and improve the attracting and killing efficiency of our bacteria; On the other hand, light-regulated bidirectional transcription system can avoid over-expression of toxin proteins, and the design of suicide part can regulate the population density of engineering bacteria.This system can be divided into three main parts: photoinduced system, bidirectional transcriptional system and bait-killer system.The red light sensor (Cph8) is a fusion protein which consists of a phytochrome Cph1 and a histidine kinase domain, Envz-OmpR.The first one expresses gp35 serine integrase,(Fig.1) which can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP, the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome.All in all, biosafety is ensured in both the developing and the application stage of our project.1.At first, the plasmid expresses GFP.It is probably do harm to the crops.It is suitable for the burst of the nematodes disasters.Next it is beneficial to the creatures who live in the environment suffering serious nematodes disasters because the traditional nematicides do harm to human.For instance, all team members in the lab should wear clothes for lab-use, wear gloves and work in the super clean bench when necessary; poison reagent should be used in the fuming cupboard; and the waste liquid and medium should be poured or thrown differently.', 'keywords': 'Xochimilco formaldehyde Sclerotite temperature components hydrolysis saccharification post-staining resistance

our laboratory work exploring the vast usefulness and potential properties of silk, we were strongly inspired to look at the societal and environmental implications of our actions.Third, while synthetic biology as an emerging field has revolutionized the biotechnology industry and inspired hundreds of scientists to pursue biological engineering interdisciplinary methods in their investigations, there is a severe lack of public knowledge in the field.If you are interested in using our lesson plan for future synthetic biology outreach to abide a variety of secondary level students, linked here is a .pdf to the lesson plan generated by our program.Namely, we conducted an online public "interview" through the popular internet forum Reddit, where we conducted an Ask Me Anything, where public commenters and members of the iGEM team could freely disseminate information to the general public.We had students design basic gene circuits, and offered suggestions about where they think the science of silk can take us in the future.We hope that by discussing the basic science and displaying the simple techniques used to construct these synthetic silks, that we bridge the gap between understanding the intrinsic artistic properties of silk, and the power of the engineering principles that derive them.To expand upon our collaboration with local silk artist Jason Fahrion and the UCLA Art|Sci Center, we were graciously invited to deliver a lecture and workshop at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, entitled Natural Discourse: Flora and Fauna, where we discuss the connections between art and science within the framework of botanical gardens and natural history collections, like silk.We were fortunate enough to meet with David Breslauer, CSO and Co-Founder of Bolt Threads, a start-up company determined to bring high performance synthetic silks to the market using yeast as a model organism.Our AMA was a success, we generated over 1400 up votes and approximately 100 questions reneging from issues stemming from our project, to how iGEM and synthetic biology can positively impact current academic research and frontiers in biotechnology.We hope that this model of education, where we give students hands-on experiences and the opportunity to collaborate and give ideas to scientists in the field, can inspire and enrich students to pursue a STEM career.To help engage our community, we partnered with a UCLA science outreach group called, CityLab and a nonprofit education summer camp organization called http://starinc.org STAR Education, to develop a module specifically designed to enhance students  interest in synthetic biology.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': 'As such, we focused on maintaining rigorous microbiological and allergenic safety of our synthesized silk products, especially in the context of potentially bringing our silk samples to the Jamboree.Nephila clavipes silk, which is the expressed protein product in our project, does not pose a safety risk either.Nevertheless, skin contact and potential ingestion should be eliminated or minimized.Risks to the safety and health of the general public, particularly if any biological materials escaped from your lab:Spider silk does not pose any safety or health risk to the environment if released.In order to determine if our resulting silk products can induce an allergenic response in individuals handling the silk, we conducted a bioinformatic analysis of all protein sequences in the potential silk structures to assay for putative allergenicity.In order to analyze whether our processing silk samples are free of transgenic bacterial contamination as a byproduct of genetic silk expression, we perform a swab and streak plating analysis of our resultant silk fibers to determine if the silk samples, when swabbed onto a plate, result in growth of bacterial colonies.Fasta sequences of the amino acid structure of five silk proteins (AmelF3, MaSP1, MaSP2, B. mori heavy chain silk fibroin (FibH) and the co-spinning module were uploaded to AllergenOnline and aligned against a large peer-reviewed database of known allergens.This exception was granted based on two tests performed in advance:(1) a swab test that did not show any living transgenic bacteria remaining on a sample after it was processed(2) a bioinformatic search against AllergenOnline, a database of allergenic proteins As a manufacturing iGEM team, we take safety very seriously, especially in the context of producing unique biomaterials for use in the environmental and biomedical fields.Expressing our protein causes the chassis bacteria to be metabolically disadvantaged, and so it would likely not survive in the wild.While the biological materials that we were working with did not present any hazards, a few of our solvents and chemicals did.The proteins were analyzed using a sliding 80-mer amino acid window, determining if epitope regions of the silk protein were markers for allergenicity.This exception permits the UCLA team to present samples of bacteria-derived silk at the 2015 Giant Jamboree, as long as the silk remains in a closed container.Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.In the USA, biosafety regulations are provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA), and National Institute of Health (NIH)Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:E. coli K12 strain does not pose a major safety risk to humans.Our results, after a web with our sample samples containing proteins of the Bombyx mori fibroin heavy chain (FibH) and the co-spinning nodule containing FibNT, FibCt, and sfGFP proteins, suggests that the fibers a sterile (especially due to the post-processing wash in an 90% isopropanol coagulation bath to strengthen the fibers) (Figure 1, below).Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?No safety risks would arise from the availability of our product or the knowledge of how to generate our product.There may be some impact to materials industries if the generation of genetically altered recombinant silk became commercially viable.For example, the natural silk industry may suffer if recombinant silk with altered properties became cheap.The laboratory safety training requirements at UCLA can be found here In your country, what are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories?Overall, the results indicate that these 5 proteins contain no sliding amino acid windows that match the thresholds required for allergenicity; thus indicate our samples are potential hypoallergenic.Raw results for each protein sample can be found on the following list.', 'keywords': 'U n k n o w n',

development of our project we decided to go a bit further and learn more about the legislation required in our country for the creation of this type of technology in case this project ever goes out of the Lab.In this regard, proper experiments in order to avoid the release of the bacteria were done in order to check the permeability of the material used for our patch.In order to do this we decided to work alongside law students from the University of Guanajuato to see how Mexico is doing in terms of the regulation of products derived from biotechnology and synthetic biology and too see what parts of our project are required in order for them to be innocuous to humans.In the biosafety cabinet, we use the proper protection such as gloves and used sterilize loops in order to prevent any contamination both, to us and to our work.Since we are working with bacteria of the Risk groups 1 and 2, we carried out, all our experiments in a laminar flow hood.During the development of our

pIV.\x94 The pIV porin that we used for our project comes from the bacteriophage f1.In fact, in this article, the pIV porin channel behavior (produced by the filamentous phage 1 to export virions out of its E. coli host) is analysed.Let\x92s remember that staple.First thing to know, the phage F1 produces a channel porin pIV that is placed in the outer membrane of E. coli.Thanks to that method, bacteria with the open channel pIV and only them can grow on this media.Marciano and his team wanted to see if between those two pIV porins some differences in the permeability of the E. coli\x92s membrane appeared.So if the bacteria expressing pIV proteins are sensitive to vancomycin it means that the channel pIV is opened.The assembly of the phage is coupled to its extrusion which is done by a machinery composed of three phage-encoded proteins : pI and pXI in the inner membrane and pIV in the outer membrane.However, this last article showed that when using the pIV mutant (pIV*S324G) the bacteria became more sensitive to the action of vancomycin.(Spagnuolo et al., 2010)Beyond the use of vancomycin to highlight the permeability caused by the pIV*, Marciano et al, used a strain of E. coli with a deletion of the gene LamB.Identification of the gate regions in the primary structure of the secretin pIV.They achieved this by random mutagenesis of the pIV gene followed by selection for mutants with compromised barrier function, called \x93leaky\x94.This channel is closed (avoiding the lysis of the bacteria) except when the phage is leaving its host ? So it\x92s possible to open this gate but surely thanks to a gating mechanism provided by the phage.More precisely, pIV is secreted in the periplasm and then inserts into the outer membrane, where it forms a radially symmetrical 14-meric complex with a barrel like structure.Our project \x93The Gatekeeper\x94 is based on two scientific publications : the work of Marciano et al.(2010) were able to identify residues in the pIV primary structure responsible for the gating mechanism.These effects are illustrated on the figure 1.Figure 1: Graph showing the effect of vancomycin on the growth of E.Coli expressing or not pIV proteins or pIV* mutant proteins.IPTG is here used to induce the production of pIV via the control of the promoter of this gene.This one codes for a maltoporin placed in the outer membrane.Without this LamB gene, the bacteria can\x92t grow on maltodextrin (larger than triose) media; The concentration of maltodextrin was determined too (0.2% to 0.6%).(1998) on the pIV

much more time to grow on this selective medium (see figure 7).Figure 7: pIV*/pIV WT growth on selective maltodextrin media (controls)To select an inducible opening or closing of the porin, we compared bacterial viability on selective maltodextrin media in presence and absence of our transition metal ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+).Moreover, no other differences have been detected between the wild-type and the mutated porin.Figure 3: Sequencing data for the pIV WT and mutatedIn order to generate linear fragments with a targeted randomized region and overlapping ends, we performed PCR reactions using different set of primers :To verify the length of our PCR products, we used a linear version of the PIV* construct obtained via restriction with BamHI or XhoI (see figure 4).Figure 4: Amplification of the pIV gene using degenerated primers (B1-B4).The mutants selected through this step should be further investigated and characterized.In the picture below (figure 8), 83 mutants obtained after the first selection have been spotted on 4 selective media to check their potential regulable behavior.Figure 8: Second selection on selective maltodextrin media in presence and absence of our transition metal ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+).Here, we can already see some growth differences in several mutants that suggest an influence of transition metal ions present in the medium.This corresponds to 987bp and covers all the mutated regions.SequencingDue to a lack of time, we were only able to sequence over 16 leaky mutants that went through the first selection step, each presenting mutations within one of the two gates (see figure 10).(Molecular weight : Smart Ladder)During the first selection step on selective maltodextrin media, we were able to get leaky mutants (see figure 6).Figure 6: Growth of leaky mutant on selective maltodextrin medium.As a positive control, we used the pIV*S324G porin that grows on selective maltodextrin medium.For some mutants, we can observe a strong histidine enrichment within the 15 amino acids mutated region, which demonstrates the efficiency of the QuickLib method used for mutagenesis.This system induces the expression of the porin in the presence of propionate (0,5 mM) and suppresses the expression when adding glucose (1%).Figure 1: Representation of the pPro30 vector used for the expression of the pIV porinTo check the quality of these constructs, we performed a restriction reaction with HindIII.This restriction enzyme is expected to give 2 fragments when cutting the plasmids, one at 3917bp and the other at 2789bp (see figure 1).As expected, we obtained these two bands for each construct after restriction (see figure 2).Figure 2: Plasmid restriction by HindIII.This step provides us further information on the quality of our constructs.The sequencing data confirmed the punctuated mutation (pIV*S324G) located in the mutated porin (see figure 3).Histidine mutations are shown in red and other mutations are shown in yellow.These first results are very promising since a lot of colonies were obtained after the first selection step and the sequencing analysis shows mutants with many different amino acid combinations.We used this concentration for all manipulations onwards.The pPro30 vector is used for the expression of the wild-type and the mutated pIV porin.If, on the same medium, a mutant survives in presence of the ions and dies in its absence or vice-versa, it possibly contains a porin for which the gate opening or closing is regulated by Zn2+ or Ni2+.(Molecular weight : Smart Ladder)After amplification, those linear fragments are circularized back to a plasmid form thanks to the hybridization of the overlapping region and the Gibson assembly method.Figure 5: Plasmid recircularization using Gibson Assembly (B1-B4).Also, it\x92s quite surprising to see that the mutated regions are rather resistant to mutations, with some porins presenting more than 10 mutations in the gate.Figure 10: Sequencing results of the mutated porins.We observed up to 7 histidines in one of the mutants and the actual porin is made of 12 identical subunits, which means a total of 84 histidines added right on the hinge of this door.With additional sequencing results, it will be interesting to do some statistical analysis of the mutations introduced in the gates.', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'U n k

a nucleotide substitution in the AgeI restriction site.BBa_K530002 contained the illegal restriction site BglII making the part incompatible with the RFC21 Berkely Standard, which enables in-frame assembly of proteins.BBa_K530001 contained an AgeI restriction site making the part incompatible with the RFC25 Freiburg Standard.The illegal restriction sites were removed using site directed mutagenesis with primers containing nucleotide substitutions in the two restriction sites (see Figure 1).Figure 1: Primers overlapping the restriction sites are designed with a single nucleotide change to disrupt the restriction site.The alignment shows a nucleotide substitution in the BglII restriction site.The sequencing results show a substitution in the restriction sites corresponding to

conclusion, Nina suggested we should consider applying our technology for something other than therapeutic compounds:\x93Maybe this would be more applicable for production of other things than therapeutics - such as bulk chemicals, enzymes or food additives, that do not have the same quality and purity requirements.\x94 Summary of the main points from the Novo Nordisk interview:  Purity and quality of the product along with a stable supply chain and production is the most important aspects when producing therapeutics.But we need to know the consequences.\x94 was what Gernot J. Abel from the Research and Technology department at Novozymes in Bagsværd, Denmark, said, when we asked him, whether Novozymes would consider switching to Y. lipolytica as production organism in case our molecular toolbox is up and running, and then base the production on waste streams such as glycerols, fatty acids and media containing other complex carbohydrates.\x93The more you can do with one single strain, the better.Klaudia, Mikkel, Nicolai and Isabella learned all about the process of extracting oil from the plants and how a sediment consisting of complex carbohydrates is left over from the production.Implementation of substrates from waste streams in the biotech manufacturing industry The second part of our integrated human practices consisted of interviews and feedback from two of the biggest biotech companies in Denmark, Novo Nordisk A/S and Novozymes A/S, who we asked questions about our idea about using complex waste streams, such as the sediment from canola oil production, in state of the art industrial processes.Novo Nordisk currently produces recombinant insulin in the conventional baker s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by growing it on different refined sugars.We ultimately asked Nina and Kjeld from Novo Nordisk, if they believed changing their insulin production to Yarrowia lipolytica growing on abundant waste streams would be an option:\x93Well, it would be a huge project!That is where our focus is compared to changing our production host.\x94Summary of the main points from the Novozymes interview:  Production on waste streams should be cheaper compared to traditional production.Because the product quality is so important, it would be a very long and complicated changeover, which will include a new factory and new experts, so it would have to be a very good business case,\x94 Nina replied and Kjeld followed:\x93A stabile, continued supply of substrates is very important.If you can cut production costs 10% down and use different waste streams, then cool!\x94Novozymes currently base their production on easy accessible proteins and carbohydrates such as sugars and starch and as cheap as possible, but Gernot J. Abel is open to the idea of using waste streams as substrates.Nina Gunnarsson added: \x93We obviously have a big focus on having the most optimal processes with the highest possible yield with the minimum environmental impact.\x94And the most optimal process is for Novo Nordisk is one, where the demand for purity is met.Although, since we are just a group of young, blue eyed students coming from the comfort of the university, we learned a lot by investigating how our idea fit into real life settings and exploring the viability of basing industrial biotechnological processes on waste streams.Afterwards we presented our idea to players in the biotech manufacturing companies, and the feedback we recieved from them made us more aware of the challenges our technology is facing and it ultimately led us to a more feasible project.We are more focused on our obligation to provide sufficient amounts of insulin to the patients\x94said Kjeld Olesen, when we asked them if changing their substrate into a less competitive and sustainable one was something they were considering.Our RD research is important in developing but in the end of the day, you have to deliver to the market and be able to send enzymes and ship them to the customers... For us it\x92s more important that our enzymes can do their job.We integrated this in our project by investigating the growth characterstics of Y. lipolytica on the sediment and finally settling for it as a proof of concept substrate for the biorefineries of tomorrow.Visit to the local canola oil producer, Grønninggaard.We started investigating one of the classical examples of a waste stream today, glycerol, and came in contact with local biodiesel producers, Perstorp and Emmelev A/S."The nutrients are important and it\x92s important to be flexible and be able to change according to what is available on the market.Talking to the Biodiesel producers, we were suprised to find that they do not percieve glycerol as being a waste, but actually already is a valuable byproduct used in the chemical, pharmaceutical and tobacco industry.""The nutrients are important and it\x92s important to be flexible and be able to change according to what is available on the market.After realizing this we went back to the drawing board in search of a "true waste product", which did not have any competing uses.Insulin is most likely not produced from waste sources anytime soon, although the tools we have developed during this project might actually yield a viable production of bulk products in the not so distant future.Nina and Kjeld explained to us that purity in regards to avoiding degradative proteins and post-translational modification, especially O-glycosylation, is very important, but the purity of the entire process is essential to obtain the high level of quality required for a therapeutic protein.After the interviews with Novo Nordisk and Novozymes, we were even more confident in our project.We investigated their waste streams with the perception that glycerol was an abundant waste product from their productions and thereby a by-product, they would be more than happy to get of their hands.After researching less classical waste streams and talking to even more industry, we got into contact with a local canola oil producer who had a promissing substrate for our project.Cell factories is our heart and our production system, so it\x92s extremely important.\x94Like Novo Nordisk, Novozymes have one main goal and that is to deliver, what the customers require both in regards to meeting the demand for quality and quantity.Gernot stated that having a process, where the fermentor is cleanable and the fermentation controllable is essential:\x93One question is if we can make these cell factories cheaper\x85 It has to be controlled, it needs to be clean and temperature controllable.Manufacturing is about up-scaling and it\x92s one of the challenges in synthetic biology."Manufacturing is about up-scaling and it\x92s one of the challenges in synthetic biology.Making Yeastilization viableEngagement and communication with stakeholders and the potential users of our technology has been evident from day one of the project by dialog and interviews with significant players in the industry.However, he also made us aware of some the main points of the Novozymes strategy, which our technology must accommodate in order to be viable.Talking to him we learned a lot about canola oil production and waste handling, and quickly realised that this by-product was ideal for our project.', 'modeling': 'The assumption is, if we amplify the genes associated to the reactions whose fluxes increase, we can force the product and growth rate to couple.These reactions are introduced into the GSM as below: 3  phytoeneSynthase (crtYB): 2.0 geranylgeranyl diphosphate < --> 2.0 diphosphate + 2.0 H+ + phytoene caroteneDesaturaseStep1 (crtI): phytoene 6.0 H+ + neurosporene caroteneDesturaseStep2 (crtI): neurosporene lycopene + 2.0 H+ lycopeneCyslase (crtYB): lycopene --> beta-carotene + 2.0 H+  To be able to optimize beta-carotene product flux, we must define a sink, or demand reaction in the GSM, this is done by creating a boundary exchange reaction where beta-carotene is, in silico, secreted into extracellular space, this reaction is defined as: DM_bcarotene is then set consequently as objective function when optimizing for production flux.In our case, the linear program was solved in COBRA, which uses a simplex algorithm by default.8 The objective function and constraints were based on the most recent SBML model of Y. lipolytica.5 REFERENCE Further mathematical details are omitted.Using Phenotype Phase Planes to Explore Growth and Production in Different Environments The Phenotype Phase Plane is a great way to explore target flux (e.g.In the next sections, we will tell our story on how we used these algorithms to achieve our goals of exploring Y.lipolytica growth and predicting gene manipulations to achieve better beta-carotene yield.Using FBA to Calculate Steady-State Flux DistributionMost GSM problems are solved using the flux balance analysis (FBA).This is done, by incrementally increasing the beta-carotene production flux from zero towards its theoretical maximum, then under the constraints, optimize growth rate.For the network above, this is equivalent to the following set of constraints:Now, consider the full genome-scale model of Yarrowia lipolytica with (M) = 1683 metabolites and (R) = 1985 reactions.Let (r = (r_1, ... , r_R)) be the vector of the (R) reaction rates, and similarly let (m = (m_1, ... ,m_M)) be the vector of the (M) metabolites.As genes are defined and associated to reactions and metabolites in the GSM, we can simulate gene amplification, inhibition, and KOs, by giving the flux associated with that gene a value larger, smaller, or zero value, respectively.Both play important roles in the subsequent phenotype phase plane analysis.Consider a very simple metabolic network with two metabolites, (A) and (B), where (A) flows into the cell with rate (r_1), is converted into (B) with rate (r_2), which is then excreted from the cell with rate (r_3): Under a steady-state assumption, i.e.In addition to the steady-state constraints on the metabolites, for each reaction rate, (r_j), there is a lower and an upper bound ((l_j) and (u_j)).The reaction of which the rate is to be maximized, for example the biomass function, is then denoted the objective function and can be expressed as, Now, for (m_i), the equality constraint (c_i) can be expressed as a sum of all (r_j) weighted by the stoichiometric coefficients (a_{ij}), where (a_{ij}) = 0 for reactions that do not affect the concentration of the considered metabolite.The GSM has information on what metabolites are in the cell, which reactions each metabolite takes part in, the stoichiometry of the reactions, reactions\x92 rate limits, reversabilities, charge balances, genes associations etc.In our study, we couple beta-carotene yield to growth rate, and find out what genes should be amplified, inhibited, or knocked out, to achieve this coupling.The simulation results are supported by the substrate screening experiments, adding the value of predicting the effect of substrate uptake rates on growth behaviour.We fulfilled purpose 2: using Flux Scanning based on Enforced Objective Flux (FSEOF) simulations.This kind of dual-variable (C and O2) flux investigation is called Phenotype Phase Plane(PHPP) analysis, it predicts the growth rate (or product fluxes, depending on your goal) in different cultivation environments 2.A genome-scale-model (GSM) is a representation of the metabolic network in a form that computers can understand and use to calculate the fluxes (rates of reactions) of the system.To model the insertion of the beta-carotene pathway, we introduced 2 more genes - crtYB and crtI, and they catalyze 4 new reactions.Using a GSM of Yarrowia Lipolytica (Y.lipolytica), we explored how Y.lipolytica grows on different substrates and found out what genes need to be manipulated to optimize beta-carotene production.Now, define the Lagrangian function:The solution to the linear program is then found by maximizing the gradient of the Lagrangian, (\x08igtriangledown mathcal{L}(lambda,c,r)) , while satisfying all constraints, i.e.Explore how Y. lipolytica grows in different environments and identify optimal conditions for growth.Predict what genes can be amplified to enhance beta-carotene yield.We used the most recently published GSM for Y. lipolytica 5 , solved using Cameo 9 and Cobra Matlab.As we increase the enforced production flux, and solve for the other fluxes, some of these fluxes will increase, while other will decrease.Using FSEOF to Identify Gene Amplification and Inhibition Targets to Optimize Yield Any organism will, by its evolutionary nature, maximize growth rate.growth rate or product secretion rate), as a function of two fluxes, in our case, carbon source uptake rate and oxygen uptake rate.These inequality constraints can be expressed as,Having the objective function and the constraints well-stated, the linear program6 can be formulated in standard form:Solving this program is equal to optimizing the genome-scale model.Setting different constraints on the fluxes allow us to define different cultivation environments.So if our team, or another, reinitiates the beta-carotene project, the computational support is already in place to guide the wetlab teams towards more optimal growth environment and strain design.The output is the set of reaction rates for all reactions in the network along with the set of shadow prices associated with the metabolites.This allows us to predict how Y. lipolytica grows using different Carbon(C) sources and different availability of the C source and oxygen.In other words, we want an engineered strain that, in order to maximize its growth rate, it must also produce the desired product.We investigated different Carbon sources as substrates and identified lines of optimality (the optimal relationship between substrate and oxygen uptake rates).FSEOF is a technique to identify what fluxes increase, when beta-carotene flux is enforced to be a certain value.by solving the system,Then, the output will consist of the set ((f(r),r,lambda)), i.e.However, there are regions in the solution space over which the rate of shadow prices are constant.If we change the substrates in the medium to wastes, we can see how much growth behaviour changes.The algorithms include FBA (flux balance analysis) based PHPP(PHenotype Phase Plane), and FSEOF (Flux scanning based on enforced objective flux).It formulates a constraint based optimization problem from the constraints we defined for the GSM.the reaction rates (including the one corresponding to the objective function) and the shadow prices.We can set some fluxes to certain levels to simulate a specific environment, or gene manipulation, allowing us to simulate the Wild-Type\x92s (WT) and/or Mutant\x92s growth behaviour in that specific environment.We have algorithms from literatures which help us to perform these simulations.FBA is the groundstone for all the algorithms we used to conduct the GSM.The following explains the mathematical basis for GSM.The results will serve as excellent starting point and guidance for future genetic engineering efforts in the lab.As annotated whole genome sequences become common, It is possible to reconstruct a genome scale representations of the metabolic network as a computational model.These constraints can be modeled in GSM by setting balanced equations and limiting reaction rates (fluxes).In order to accomplish that, it is necessary to define the so-called Lagrangian Function.For each constraint (c_i) on the metabolite (m_i), let (lambda_i) be the associated Lagrange multiplier7 or shadow price, let (lambda = (lambda_i,...,lambda_M)) and let (c = (c_1,...,c_M, c_{M+1}...,c_{M+R})).where all metabolite levels are constant and no metabolite can be accumulated in the system, the formation and degradation rates for each metabolite must cancel each other.Thus,Which is just a generalization of the constraints of the two-metabolite network presented in the previous section.We do this by manipulating its genes, forcing product yield and growth rate to go hand-in-hand.The beta-carotene project was later shelved, due to problems with the biobricks and cloning.', 'notebook': 'More

Promoter.The main metabolite in the degradation of insecticide pyrethroids is 3-phenoxybenzoate (3-PBA).Because of the wide use of pyrethroids and the stability of the diarylether compound itself, 3-PBA is typically detected as an important environmental contaminant.The main metabolite in the degradation of insecticide pyrethroids is 3-phenoxybenzoate (3-PBA) which is is typically detected as an important environmental contaminant[1].Through searching a large number of papers and analyzing data, we found that the harms of 3-PBA are as follows:The half life period of 3-PBA is about 180 days , longer than most of pyrethroids, making it difficult to be degraded in the environment.Hindering the mineralization of pyrethroids?which cut off the biodegradation pathway that pesticide is transformed into non-toxic (poisonousless) small molecule.3-PBA is an important material in chemical industryTo analyze the toxicity of the 3-PBA, we used fruit fly to test.Our device is designed to degrade 3-phenoxybenzoatecompletelyFig2.The passway of biodegradation of 3-pba in our engineering bacteriaCopA, the principal copper effluxATPase in Escherichia coli, is induced by elevated copper in the medium[1].Gene cluster pbaA1A2B and gene pbaC encode the 3-phenoxybenzoate 1 ,2 -dioxygenase,which is an angular dioxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation in the 1 and 2  positions of the benzene moiety of 3-phenoxybenzoate(3-PBA)[4], yielding 3-hydroxybenzoate(3-HBA)[5] and catechol.D .Changes in fluorescenceintensity in E.coli which do not contain copA promoter comparing with two strains.We placed insulator RiboJ between copA promoter and RBS(Fig.5).Fig.5.Two device used to detect copper in solution, the upper device has riboJ and the under one has no riboJ.Catechol , an intermediate metabolite of 3-PBA, is toxic to the Escherichia coli.Output ( fluorescence) depended only on the activity of copA promoter when be induced, and not the sequence at the part junction.In the lab, we aim to realize the biodegradation of 3-PBA using recombinant plasmid.By measuring fluorescence intensity in cells by flow cytometer,we got data to analyze sensitivity and specificity of copA promoter.In our experiment, copA promoter was induced by different concentration of copper ion (37.5umol/L, 50umol/L, 62.5umol/L, 75umol/L) .We tested 3-PBA s influence on reproductive capacity of fruit fly, and found that 3-PBA can affect the normal secreting of sex hormone.We counted the number of the new imagoes hatched by flies that were fed in medium with 3-PBA before.In comparison of two graphs A, B, we can obviously find that the degradation of protein is much faster in DH5? than that in BL21 (DE3)?because BL21 (DE3) has a deficiency of protease.CopA promoter is active in the presence of copper ion.We intended to character copA promoter independently.Actually, the fluorescence which produced by the leakage of copA will not change.The change quantity comes from the different growth periods of the E.coli.In the group of 0?mol/L Cu2+, the fluorescence shows a trend of falling firstly then rising(Fig.3C).So bacteria will go through a period of growing from growth period to maturation period, so as to the change of the fluorescence.Maturation period is great period for the expression of protein.The genes pbaC-pbaA1A2B-c23o-mhbDHIM, encoding enzymes of the 3-phenoxybenzoate degradation pathway were successfully built finally.and the whole metabolic pathway is shown in Fig2..Fig1.Based on these facts we can get a formula Net proceeds(N)=Benefit(B)-Cost(C).Simplest genetic circuit ---our small step to degradationWe used constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) to transcribe downstream genes including gene cluster pbaA1A2B and C23O.Insecticide pyrethroids are widely used in the agricultural production to control the insect pest.However, the efficiency of removal of these compounds by bacteria is actually low for they evolve on the basis of environmental fitness rather than degradation efficiency.Therefore , we utilized RiboJ which was placed between promoter and protein coding sequence to eliminate the interference of two different parts.However, according to our preliminary experiment , Sphingobiumwenxiniae JZ-1T is easy to lose the ability of degradation and cannot grow in LB medium containing high concentration of 3-PBA.Fig.3.A.Changes in fluorescenceintensity induced by different concentration of copper ion in E.coli BL21 (DE3).RiboJ can reliably maintain relative promoter strengths.We test copA promoter in BL21 (DE3),DH5?.CopA promoter has relative leaky basal expression by comparing the negative control\x92s output and basal leakage of copA promoter in E. coli expression systems(Fig.4).As a metabolite, 3-PBA is easy to be ignored by people.', 'design': 'Sphingobium wenxiniae JZ-1 was designed to put into the unit to degrade pyrethroids.Meeting the standard of farmland discharge in China main

the physcial unit*The whole unit is divided into five rooms and they are numbered separately (the second room is under the first room; number 5 is not marked and the fifth room is near the fourth room from right to left orientation ) and all the plates used to separate the unit into five rooms are covered by the 0.22?m bacterial membrane to prevent the bacterial escape.On the bottom of the first room there is acticarbon to pretreat the water to be purified.Both 3-PBA and pyrethroids can be found in the run off water.For being eager to take the first steps to make our project real, we designed a physcial unit applied in the field to purify farmland runoff water (regarded as the main factor of agricultral pollution[1]) including 3-PBA and pyrethroids.Through farmland investigation, we found runoff water from cropland was seldom collected and purified.3) The ponds can collect the contaminant [4].To put the engineered bacteria into practice, some issues have to be handled.Meeting the standard of farmland discharge in China main land3-PBA comes from its parent compounds pyrethroids which are more frequently touched by the public and also is used as a generic biomarker for multiple pyrethroids exposure for pyrethroid residues in the environment.Set a man-made pond(?) to collect pyrethroids and 3-PBA and the physical unit(?) is beside the pond.The unit is pumped.The physical unit will be put into the places applied pyrethroids to achieve its value.2) people in the research institutes always want to use plant ryegrass and photinia fraseri to lighten contamination[3].Based on documents, we found 1) people had no idea about farmland runoff water disposal [2].Between the pond and the place applied pyrethroids(?) there is a moderate climb(?) to help the pyrethroids and 3-PBA collecting.Avoiding to pollute the drinking water source the man-made pond should be at least away from the water source 90 meters.The third room is used to cut down the BOD and COD index value applying yeast and Actinobacillus.Based on our questionnaire, about 10% of interviewees come from rural areas, but only 3.5% of the whole interviewees know that pyrethroids are widely used pesticides

Research of Ditch Ecological Interception of Nitrogen and Phosphorus.', 'human_practice': 'Greater hazards would be caused by insufficient knowledge and ignorance especially when heavy use of products exerts harmful effects on pregnant women and children, and there are pyrethroid insecticide residues on our grains, vegetables and fruits.Our NAU iGEM team aims to popularize the basics of pyrethroids, their hazardous effects due to long-term and improper use, the way of purchasing and using these products, measures to take after poisoning, etc., without arousing unnecessary public panic.If the pyrethroids accumulate in human body, they will definitely do harm to human health and lead to severe consequences that cannot be ignored.Hazardous effects of pyrethroid matters in insect repellent productsPyrethroid insecticides are widely used in our life; however, we found that the respondents do not know these poisonous matters, not to mention their hazardous effects.Once poisoned in fetus period, a crucial period of tissue and organ development, the effect will last a lifetime.Based on the above literature review, a questionnaire is designed to survey insect repellent users on types of insect repellent products they choose, use frequency, their knowledge about pyrethroids, and pyrethroids  hazardous effect on pregnant women, infants and children, etc.We have collected 680 valid questionnaires (all completed) at the end of the survey.We have analyzed the data we have collected.By count, 59.71% of the respondents do not know what pyrethroids are, 28.38% once heard of them, and merely 3.24% know them well.Only 18.09% of the respondents know that pyrethroids in insect repellent products may remain in human body due to slow degradation and accumulated residues may affect health of pregnant women and children intelligence development.In China, a variety of mosquito coils, electric mosquito mats, electric mosquito liquids and insect aerosol sprays are heavily used inside the room in summer, which increases humans  exposure to pyrethroid pesticides and potential health problems in turn.To pregnant women and infants, who are in special physiological stage, pyrethroid pesticides are particularly hazardous, because they are more susceptible and less resistant to the harmful substance than ordinary adults.We also sent an electronic copy of our brochure to UNICEF in the hope that we can make a little effort on the healthy growth of children around the world.Our NAU iGEM team aims to popularize the basics of pyrethroids, their hazardous effects due to long-term and improper use, the way of purchasing and using these products, measures to take after poisoning, etc., without arousing unnecessary public panic.The results reveal that only Liushen products are insect repellent fragrance and other products of Raid, Cheerwin and Gunner are all pesticides with pyrethroids, which increases humans\x92 exposure to pyrethroids.30.59% of the respondents use insect repellent products everyday in mosquito season, and 57.06% use irregularly.However, most of the respondents do not know the harm brought by these products.To summarize, though the results of the survey may be a bit partial and incomplete to some extent due to the small sample size, it is undeniable that people s knowledge about pyrethroid products is insufficient.2012, 11(6)1765-1788Considering that people know less about pyrethroid products and we think we shoulder the responsibility to inform the respondents our findings, we have found out the mailboxes of some respondents and sent them an analysis of our survey results.In order to verify the conclusion of literature review, during this summer vacation, our team members conducted product research in local supermarkets, investigating some common brands of insect repellent for their ingredients and asking the salespersons about the sales of mosquito repellent products.In addition, our team members have published the questionnaire feedback on our social networking platform QQ and WeChat in the hope that our questionnaire analysis and feedback can be known by more people around us.We have made and distributed brochures of our project to urban or rural residents, especially the elderly, pregnant women and other people who may be exposed to pyrethroid products more frequently to make them aware of our findings.[2] LORETTA C G, JUDITH L E,JOHN E C. Pesticide interactions; Effects of organ phosphorus pesticides on the metabolism, toxicity, and persistence of selected pyrethroid insecticides[J].Under natural conditions, pyrethroid pesticides are hard to degrade, while their long-term accumulation leads to accumulated toxicity, contributing to chronic diseases[4], neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity[5].Pyrethroid pesticides are also used as domestic insect repellents.Among them, the active ingredient of insect repellent fragrance is "diethyltoluamide", while that of the other products is pyrethroids.Our NAU iGEM team member investigated in supermarket the components of certain insect repellent products as indicated by the user survey.This preliminary research provides good ideas to our questionnaire design.According to literature review, we know that pyrethroid insecticides are widely and heavily used in our life due to their large application scope.By way of literature review, we know that pyrethroids are important ingredients of mosquito coil, electric mosquito mat, electric mosquito liquid, etc., expect for insect repellent fragrance.The analysis results are as follows:The survey shows that most insect repellent users choose insect repellent fragrance, mosquito coil and electric mosquito liquid.Some exposure to pyrethroid pesticides may not have effects on ordinary adults, but to fetuses and infant, the same exposure may cause severe developmental disorders.The correct way to buy and use pyrethroid pesticide properly, the way to reduce pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits and measures to take after pyrethroid pesticide poisoning, etc.Chronicillness as a result of low-level exposure to synthetic pyrethroid insecticides: a review of the debate.27.50% of the respondents use up more than 1 bottle (box) of insect repellent product throughout a summer.All these data show that humans have frequent and long-term exposure to pyrethroid insecticides.[3] WOLANSKY M J, HARRILL J A.

from PCs contains more gold than the one recovered from 17 tons of gold ore [1].For these reasons we decided to make a project based on a eco-friendly bioleaching technology using two modified bacteria, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Chromobacterium violaceum, for recovering metals from the e-waste.Bioleaching is the process of metal extraction undertaken by microorganisms.We will also test it as a potential selectivity marker for C. violaceum under these alkaline conditions (pH=9.5).After gold is recovered in the third module, we will degrade the remaining cyanide, as it is too toxic to be released to the environment without previous treatment.We will use a different transformant of C. violaceum that will overexpress cyanide hydratase, a cyanide degrading enzyme.It was found that the pH of the original strain had come down to a pH of 0.63, thus all organic material was dissolved despite A. ferrooxidans being an acidophile.With the acid oxidation process used in Module I, metals such as copper, zinc and nickel are solubilized by A. ferrooxidans, but valuable metals like gold and silver are not.(see Modelling)It was transformed successfully with a pretty standard electroporation protocol (Broetto et al, 2005).We were able to transform it using iGEM\x92s standard PSB1C3 plasmid with a calcium competency protocol for E. coliIn order to improve the efficiency of the process, we will modify C. violaceum using two basic constructs:Though C. violaceum is a native cyanide producer, this basal production is relatively low and regulated by quorum sensing.In a previous study, cyanide production was successfully uncoupled from quorum sensing regulation by transformation with hydrogen cyanide synthase (hcnABC) under pARA regulation (Tay et al, 2013).pGolS is a promoter that has been used previously by other iGEM teams.Pseudomonas fluorescens)It was shown by Pham & Ting (2009) that gold recovery with C. violaceum is more effective than with P. fluorescens as long as the e-waste has been pre-oxidized, as we have designed in Module I.It has already been studied as a bacteria of biotechnological interest because of its adaptability to different stresses.Chief among these characteristics, its resistance to heavy metals and ability to grow using many different carbon sources stand out, as was described by the Brazilian National Genome Project Consortium (2003), the team that first reported sequencing its genome.As it is a native cyanide producer, it is also highly resistant to it (Niven, Collins & Knowles, 1975).It is relatively easy to manage in the lab (similar enough to E. coli as to allow the use of very similar lab protocols)It grows in LB media, with observed population kinetics similar to E. coli.The overexpression of TetH in A. ferrooxidans leads to have a high expression of sulfates in the culture media, with more activity, more protons are released to the media and leads to a greater solubilization of metal ions.Overexpressing a specific gene in an organism, may affect cell\x92s metabolism and growth rate.Thus, in order to mantain a pH = 9.5, a base has to be continously added to the reactor.Within our construct, the proton pump is regulated by a weak constitutive promoter from the Anderson collection, and the coding sequence is optimized for its expression in C. violaceum.From module I, elemental sulfur is produced due to the metabolism of A. ferrooxidans.We optimized the original sequence for C. violaceum and used this system along with Hydrogen Cyanide Synthase operon hcnABC in order to create a self-regulatory system that activates in the presence of gold, increasing cyanide production and enabling the solubilization of this precious metal as [Au(CN)2]\x96.Hydrogen cyanide synthase generates HCN, not free CN- ions.In fact, Brown, Turner, and O reilly (1995) reported that a modified E. coli reached 5.5 times the cyanide degrading activity compared to that observed in the native F. lateritium.Broetto, L., Cecagno, R., Sant anna, F. H., Weber, S., & Schrank, I. S. (2005).Science of The Total Environment, 408(2), 183-191. doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.044The first microorganism implemented onto our three step synbio system, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, is a chemoautotrophic bacteria that thrives in very acidic pH (1.5 to 3.0).In the mining industry, it has been established that a pH > 9.4 is ideal (Marsden & House, 2006), as at lower pH values not enough HCN is dissociated; and at higher pH values other factors (such as salinity) become more important.As shown in the modelling section, the overall gold solubilizing reaction generates H+.Thanks to the acidic conditions of A. ferrooxidans Fe(II) is stable and Fe(III) is more soluble than at standard pH (7.0)Phase I: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was obtained from the Geomicrobiology Laboratory of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí, which was isolated from a mine in Durango, Mexico.Due to these alarming problematics, our main motivation for the project is to create a novel synbio system to improve the e-waste recycling technology and make it a feasible approach to reduce the pollutants, and generating a business model with the recycling of these valuable metals.E-waste contains valuable metals as well as potential environmental contaminants.C. violaceum has several characteristics that make it ideal for our project:It is more suited for the project compared to other bacteria that could also be used for cyanide bioleaching.From module I, ions of Fe+2 are produced due to the metabolism of A. ferrooxidans.The composite part BBa_K2055025 uses the T7 system in order to express the enzyme sulfur reductase, which catalyzes the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of elemental sulfur in the presence of oxygen, with sulfite and hydrogen sulfide as products.Figure 3.From Table 1, it can be observed that copper, silver and gold be reduced to a neutral charge spontaneously when coupled with the H2S half-cell.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 100(20), 11660-11665. doi:10.1073/pnas.1832124100 Rinágelová, A., Kaplan, O., Veselá, A.The protocol for the bioleaching experiments consisted in adding 1 g of slag per liter of medium in a flask containing A. ferrooxidans in a set exponential phase.CueR is a transcription factor that stimulates the transcription at the pgolS promoter when bound to copper or gold, as was described by iGEM York 2013.Both mediums were adjusted to a pH of 4.0 and autoclaved at 121 Celsius for 15 min.A first experiment was carried to evaluate the growth of the bacteria in liquid medium with elemental sulfur and sodium thiosulfate.We retrieved this sequence from ferrooxidans\x92 genome and ran a nucleotide blast to find similitudes with other promoters just as done by the Ribeiro\x92s article.Inverted operon with a Ferric Uptake Regulator & a LacI coding sequences.It follows that this construct increases its own expression through positive feedback in the presence of gold or copper through the production

potential difference between the two electrodes can be used as power source to feed a small device or be stored in a battery for its later use.Figure 1.It is commonly used by mining companies for the industrial recovery of metals such as Zn, Ni and Cu from residual dirt and waste materials from their processes.As the pgolS promoter has a basal transcription level, some CueR would be constantly expressed.Group 1 had 10 g/L of elemental sulfur, group 2 had 10 g/L of sodium thiosulfate and group 3 had 5 g/L of elemental sulfur + 5 g/L of sodium thiosulfate.The groups of the experiment consisted in: (1) Control medium without bacteria, (2) Control medium with bacteria without genetic modifications, (3) Bacteria with tetH overexpression.The flasks were incubated for 15 days, taking aliquotes the days 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 to analyze the metal content with ICP-OES, then the data would be compared to the original ewaste and the metals solubilized were calculated.After being washed three times with distilled water, the solid residues of the bioleach treatment or the acid medium treatment were transferred to the Chromobacterium violaceum alkaline bioleaching phase of our MetalEca process.A.When iron is in a sufficient concentration, it makes a complex with the FUR protein which then binds to the FURBOX inhibiting LacI transcription, activating the pLac promoter and the transcription TeTH sequence for protein synthesis.The characterization of the part would be done using an RFP coding sequence, instead of the production of TetH.As a result, most of the electronic waste is dumped in landfills where it is burned with other wastes generating dioxins, hydrogen chloride and other compounds that directly affect the environment.It was expected that the curve of the group 3 had the biggest slope value.Unfortunately three weeks after our first inoculum we lost our strain due to a failure in the pH measurements, when we tried to inoculate them again to fresh media cells would not grow.The solubilised metals are going to be then used in the galvanic cell, but they will have to reduced or oxidised first.Figure 2.Sulfur reductase is used to catalyze the reduction of elemental sulfur in the presence of oxygen, with sulfite and hydrogen sulfide as products.Metals recovered with Chromobacterium violaceum.The solubilised metals are going to be then used in the reduction half-cell.TetH is involved in the electron transfer for A. ferrooxidans.[4] Monterrey is the leading city with a high concentration of PM10 particles among Latin American countries.It is estimated that industrial activities and \x93primitive\x94 e-waste recycling techniques are among the main factors for the release of these type of particles into the atmosphere [3].Expression of the cyanide hydratase enzyme from Fusarium lateritium in Escherichia coli and identification of an essential cysteine residue.The reaction increases the acidity of the media and releases sulfates, which chelate metals.For the bioleaching process, e-waste was washed three times with distilled water to diminish the natural basic pH of the metals.In a galvanic cell, the element with the higher (or more positive) reduction potential gets reduced and the one with the lower (or more negative) reduction potential gets oxidized.To solve this problem, we will use two control mechanism to inhibit gene expression when not needed: a temperature induced promoter (HSP) and an iron induced inverted operon (FUR/FURBOX).Heat Shock Promoter is a ?32-dependent promoter for for the Afe_1437 gene in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Ribeiro, D. A.,2011).BLAST analysis revealed that the translated golS protein included in the part submitted by York 2013 has a 100% homology with CueR from Salmonella typhimurium.The metropolitan area is considered as the most polluted in Latin America in terms of air quality [2].First, without the presence of iron, the lactose inhibits the pLac promoter.One of the main reasons is the high concentration of PM10 in the atmosphere, particles so small that they are able to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause a wide variety of pulmonary and heart diseases, leading to a premature death.For further information on these control mechanisms and the rest of our parts, please go to the Parts section of our wiki.Although iron is the most abundant transition metal on Earth, its solubility is very low at neutral pH in aerobic environments.In the case of nickel and zinc, they can\x92t be reduced by sulfur oxidation, they needs to be recovered by using an electric current or in another cell arrangement.In the left side, the oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur occurs.However, the recovery of these last two metals is vital in making the process economically viable, due to their high market value and relative scarcity.[2]The main benefit of using recycled metals over their virgin materials is the significant energy saved, almost 95%!This promoter is induced by gold, through the binding of transcriptional activator GolS with gold, which later binds to the recognition site of the promoter allowing for higher expression of genes in the presence of gold.Using the reduction potentials of the metallic ions in the solutions, we established a spontaneous reaction by coupling them with the oxidation of S2- from H2S into S0.Thus, our construct is constituted by the pgolS promoter and the coding sequence of CueR.In the right side, the reductions occur and the recovery of metals occur.Çolak, D., et al.Since free CN- ions are responsible for the reaction that solubilizes gold, we must take into account the dissociation of HCN.Also the expression of the desired gene will tend to decrease over time.The reaction that takes place is illustrated in the following figure:Figure 1.The agar medium was made with the same concentrations, only 12.5 g/L was added.Journal of General Microbiology,90(2), 271-285. doi:10.1099/00221287-90-2-271Tay, S. B., Natarajan, G., Rahim, M. N., Tan, H. T., Chung, M. C., Ting, Y. P., & Yew, W. S. (2013).Its mechanism underlies on the transformation of solid metal compounds into soluble products that can be easily extracted and recovered, due to the catabolism of microorganisms.An effective way to solubilize them is by bioleaching with a cyanide-producing organism such as C. violaceum.Monterrey is one of the leading industrialized cities in Mexico, but this growth has led to many environmental and health issues.The enzyme tetrathionate hydrolase (TetH), which is produced inside the bacteria and then taken out to the external matrix, constantly converts tetrathionate to two molecules: thiosulfate and elemental sulfur.We added bromocresol green (0.5% V/V) on the petri dishes in order to identify the colonies and calculate the colony-forming unit of each experimental group.Tetrathionate is a key intermediate during RISC oxidation, hydrolyzed by tetrathionate hydrolase (TetH), and used as sole energy source.http://www.cleanairinstitute.org/calidaddelaireamericalatina/cai-report-english.pdfGangwar, C., Singh, A., Kumar, A., Chaudhry, A. K., & Tripathi, A.Ferrooxidans is an acidophilic bacteria that turns its own culture media into a more acidic environment to satisfy its growing conditions.Iron oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, giving it a big enough reduction potential for its reduction to happen spontaneously.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'Later CVR agreed to provide us with the shredded e-waste for our project.After this, we involved our community in different events aimed to create consciousness about e-waste pollution and the dreadful consequences of incorrect e-waste disposal.Meeting with CVR, one of the few certified e-waste recycling companies in Mexico.This aspect is reflected in our numerous events, evidence we saw on the enormous pile of e-waste we collected during four days, weighing almost a ton!We knew that informing our community about the issues we face every day and how synthetic biology is a powerful tool able to fix them wouldn\x92t be enough.We also wanted to inform as much people as we could about the different ways in which they could participate and come up with solutions to help us improve our current situation.We sent this huge amount of e-waste to CVR, a certified recycling company, where it could be treated correctly.Throughout this process, our experience allowed us to evaluate and reshape our project according to society\x92s needs.', 'modeling': 'This time, however, there is no basal expression and the degradation constant is the same, so we only expand upon equation eqref{eq:ECell} adding the production rate modeled by the Hill equation with Hill coefficient (n = 1): frac{dE_{Cell}}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}} + frac{gamma AuCN_{in}}{K_{E} + AuCN_{in}} - delta_{E}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} + k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} It should be noted that the overexpression of HCN synthase is activated after the regular expression regulated by quorum sensing as it depends on the detection of dicyanoaurate(I) ion.We will use the following parameters in the development of the model:Diffusion parameter for the autoinducer outside the cellConcentration of CviR-AHL complex (2 AHL and 2 CviR molecules)Rate constant for AHL production due to CviI concentrationRate constant for the formation of CviR-AHL complexRate constant for the dissociation of the CviR-AHL complexRate of AHL diffusion across the membrane for each cellCviI production parameter due to bound CviR-AHL to the promoterCviR-AHL concentration occupying half of the binding sitesConcentration of HCN synthase inside C. violaceum (non-active)Concentration of HCN synthase in C. violaceum\x92s membrane (active)HCN synthase production parameter due to bound CviR-AHL to the promoterConcentration of HCN synthase complexed with glycineConcentration of HCN synthase complexed with glycine and two acceptorsAu concentration (amount of solid gold in the reaction tank)Rate of dicyanoaurate(I) ion diffusion across the membrane for each cellHCN synthase production parameter due to bound (\text{Au}pars{\text{CN}}_2^{-}) to the promoter(\text{Au}pars{\text{CN}}_2^{-}) concentration occupying half of the binding sites We start by proposing a model for the population growth.So we re-write equation eqref{eq:EMemb} and write the kinetic equations for (G), (C_1), (C_2), (Ac), (HCN) and (AcH_2): frac{dE_{Memb}}{dt} = -k_{EC}E_{Memb}G + k_{CP}C_{2}+k_{CE}C_{1} + k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell}-k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} These equations describe the HCN production by following the intermediate steps where the enzyme binds to glycine and the acceptors.Initially, the solution will contain (Fe^{+2}) that will be diffused through the cell membrane according to Fick s first law of diffusion: This iron will combine with the protein Fur to form a complex which we will call (C_{1}) according to the reaction: F_{in} + Fur overset{k_{FC}}{underset{k_{CF}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{1} frac{dF_{in}}{dt} = k_{FC}FurF_{in} + k_{CF}C_{1} The complex (C_{1}) will act as an inhibitor to the expression of the proteins Fur and LacI, so their expression rates will be: frac{dFur}{dt} = alpha_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{C_{1}}{K_{1}}} - delta_{Fur}Fur frac{dLacI}{dt} = alpha_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{C_{1}}{K_{1}}} - delta_{LacI}LacI LacI also acts as an inhibitor to the expression of the enzyme Tetrathionate hydrolase.Taking into account the basal production in the absence of CviR-AHL and the degradation of (E), we get: frac{dE}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}}-delta_{E}E The enzyme then proceeds to insert itself into the membrane where it is active and can produce HCN.So, the expression of TetH is given by: frac{dTetH}{dt} = \x08eta_{0} + frac{1}{1+frac{LacI}{K_{2}}} - delta_{TetH}TetH Figure 1: As Fur-Fe(^{2+}) complex appears, it inhibits LacI production and the existing LacI degradates.It is known that the reaction for TetH is given by: TetH + S overset{k_{TC}}{underset{k_{CT}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{2} overset{k_{CS}}{\rightarrow} SO_{4}^{-2} + S_{2}O_{3}^{-2} + 2:H^{+} + TetH dfrac{dTetH}{dt} = -k_{TC}(TetH)(S) + k_{CT}C_{2} + k_{CS}C_{2} frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = k_{TC}(TetH)(S) - k_{CT}C_{2} - k_{CS}C_{2} Notice that the pH of the solution will diminish because of the production of (H^{+}) by TetH.The chemical-like reaction of insertion (and withdraw) would be the following: Therefore the equations that describe HCN synthase (before its overexpression) would be: frac{dE_{Memb}}{dt} = k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} frac{dE_{Cell}}{dt} = b_0 + frac{bR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}} - delta_{E}E_{Cell} - k_{E_{on}}E_{Cell} + k_{E_{off}}E_{Memb} We proceed to analyze the production of HCN using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics.Because the degradation of mRNA molecules occurs much faster than the degradation of proteins, the system quickly falls in a quasi-steady-state where (frac{dm}{dt}=0) and the concentration of m at that time is: Substituting back in the equation for (\rho(t)) we have: where (alpha=frac{k_{1}k_{0}}{delta_{m}}) is the constant expression rate.The equations that describe this transitions are: E_{Memb} + G &overset{k_{EC}}{underset{k_{CE}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{1}\\ C_{1} + 2: Ac &overset{k_{CC_1}}{underset{k_{CC_2}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{2}\\ C_{2} overset{k_{CP}}{\rightarrow} HCN +&: CO_{2} + 2: AcH_2 Figure 5: This graph shows the consumption of glycine and the acceptor taking into account all the equations described in this model (i.e.Writing the chemical kinetics following the law of mass action, we get: frac{dR^{ast}}{dt} = k_{QS_1}A^2pars{R_T-2R^{ast}}^2 - k_{QS_2}R^{ast} To describe the transcription from DNA to a product protein we can use the equations (Ingalls, 2012): frac{dm}{dt}=k_{0} - delta_{m}m(t), qquad frac{d\rho}{dt}=k_{1}m(t) - delta_{\rho}\rho(t), where (m) and (\rho) represent the concentration of mRNA molecules and product protein, (delta_m) and (delta_\rho) represent their degradation constants, (k_0) is the transcription rate from DNA to mRNA and (k_1) is the transcription rate from mRNA to (\rho).Adding the production of (HCN) and its reaction with gold, we get: frac{dHCN}{dt} = 8pars{-k_{fAuCN}HCN^{8}Au^{4} + k_{rAuCN}AuCN_{out}^4}Au^{2/3} + k_{CP}C_2 Figure 7: Following our approximation of gold cyanidation, this graph shows the dissolution of gold pebbles by HCN produced by C. violaceum.It should be noted that C. violaceum produces HCN, whose dissociation equation is: To simplify the process we combine both reactions to obtain: 4: Au + 8: HCN + O_{2} overset{k_{fAuCN}}{underset{k_{rAuCN}}{\rightleftharpoons}} 4: Au(CN)_{2}^{-} + 2: H_{2}O + 4: H^{+} It is important to note that the combination of these equations may create some deviations against the real cyanidation process.Writing the equation for (A) will give us: frac{dA}{dt} = -2k_{QS_1}A^2(R_{T} - 2R^{ast})^2 + 2k_{QS_2}R^{ast} + k_{QS_0}I-r_{QS}(A-A_{ext}) We also include an expression for (A_{ext}) considering diffusion through the cell.We will assume that the more TetH is produced, the more Copper will be dissolved according to the reaction: Cu + Fe_{2}(SO_{4})^{-2}_{3},\rightleftharpoons, Cu^{+2} + 2:Fe^{+2} + 3:SO_{4}^{-2} The amount of dissolved (Fe^{+2}) in the medium will also increase.A glycine molecule binds to a HCN synthase in the membrane, forming a complex (C_1).We then use simple kinetics to model the reaction as if it were homoge- neous but with a simple modification: frac{dAu}{dt}=4pars{-k_{fAuCN}HCN^{8}Au^{4} + k_{rAuCN} AuCN_{out}^4}Au^{2/3} As noted in the equations above, a (Au^{2/3}) term was added.Figure 4: Following the population growth model from Figure (3) and the equations described in this section, we obtained a model for the concentration of CviI, which shows the steep switch-like activation of the quorum sensing mechanism.The reaction that occurs between the unbound CviR and AHL can be expressed as follows: If we consider that the total amount of CviR is fixed, the amount of unbound CviR can be given by (R = R_T \x96 2 R^{ast}), this is evident from the previous equation because two CviR monomers are needed in order to create a CviR-AHL complex.We will use the following parameters in the development of the model:Average concentration of (Fe^{2+}) inside A. ferroxidansAverage concentration of (Fe^{2+}) outside A. ferroxidansRate of (Fe^{2+}) diffusion across the membrane for each cellAverage concentration of Fur complexed with (Fe^{2+})Rate constant for the dissociation of (C_1) complexBasal expression of the cassette (coding for Fur and LacI)(C_1) concentration occupying half of the binding sitesLacI concentration occupying half of the binding sitesRate constant for the dissociation of (C_2) complexRate constant for the formation of the products of (C_2) We will not consider the reactions going on outside the cell in order to simplify the model.It is also produced linearly by CviI and we need to take into account that the degradation of (R^{ast}) liberates 2 molecules of (A).Following Fick\x92s Law of diffusion we get: With this description of the diffusion of the ion, we can model the over-expression of HCN synthase as we have previously done so with CviI and HCN synthase in equations eqref{eq:I} and eqref{eq:E0}.The promoter that encodes for this enzyme is regulated by a quorum sensing mechanism: a process through which bacteria sense the population density in their close surroundings with the help of the autoinducer (signaling molecule) N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL).Hydrogen cyanide produced by C. violaceum is generated by the enzyme HCN synthase, whose expression is regulated by quorum sensing.As (A) is going to be diffused through the cell membrane, we apply Fick\x92s Law of diffusion.The chemical equation describing gold cyanidation is: 4: Au + 8: CN^{-} + O_{2} + 2: H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons 4: Au(CN)_{2}^{-} + 4: OH For the kinetics of the reaction we will consider O(_2) concentration as constant due to the fact that oxygen can be constantly supplied to the reactor tank and small variations have little effect on the reaction speed.A term is added for concentrations that diffuse far away from the cell population and don\x92t contribute to the reaction: Equations eqref{eq:CviI}, eqref{eq:I}, eqref{eq:A}, eqref{eq:Aext}, along with the population growth equation eqref{eq:P}, describe the process know as quorum sensing.This happens because A. ferrooxidans obtains its energy by oxidizing (Fe^{2+}) to (Fe^{3+}) and producing (SO_{4}^{2-}) during a process of electron exchange in the membrane.In order to increase HCN production with the objective of dissolving gold, a genetic modification to overexpress HCN synthase is proposed.One of the modifications made to C. violaceum is the addition of a cassette that overexpresses HCN synthase.Because CviI is part of an autoregulated gene circuit with positive feedback and (R^{ast}) acting as a promoter, then the transcription of CviI can be expressed as: frac{dI}{dt}=a_0 + frac{aR^{ast}}{K_{M} + R^{ast}}-delta_{I}I Here (alphaequiv a_0) for the basal production and (alphaequiv a) for the production where (R^{ast}) promotes the transcription.Although the time scale given is accurate for the population, this only shows the expected behavior as the rates of HCN production and gold cyanidation are unknown.Assuming perfect spheres of solid gold with an average diameter, we concluded that the proportion of superficial area to the amount of undissolved gold would be ([Au]^{2/3}).We will work with a constant pH of 9 (pH inside the reactor tank can be measured and controlled by a device that liberates a base into the solution, this came from previous simulations where there were significant pH changes; equation eqref{eq:mergeAuCyan} has protons as a product, this also suggested the team to work with a proton pump).Because the focus of this mathematical model is to describe the bio-bricks and gold cyanidation is a very complex field of study, the latter is beyond our scope and so we will take a simplified approach.We propose a behavior similar to the law of mass action on the basis that the probability of the insertion into the membrane will depend on the amount of (E) in the cell and that it should reach an equilibrium where the membrane gets to a saturated status for that specific amount of (E).It demonstrates a clear dependence on both glycine and the acceptor for HCN production: as long as there is a healthy population, there will be a production of HCN given that there are enough resources.Studies have found that a number of phenotypic characteristics in C. violaceum such as the production of violacein, hydrogen cyanide, antibiotics and exoproteases are regulated by the endogenous N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone through the process of quorum sensing.As this enzyme is encoded in the same cassette where CviI is encoded, it is also regulated by CviR-AHL and so the production rate of can be modeled in the same way.For this we add the population term (p) because each cell is going to be producing the molecule and contributing to the extracellular space.We will also consider the same population model we used for Chromobacterium violaceum in the section below.Figure 8: An increased slope clearly shows the effect of the overexpression of HCN synthase.For this reason, it is important that we take into consideration the diffusion of the ion across the membrane.Because of this, there will be some enzymes inside the cell and others will be in the membrane.Equation eqref{eq:AcH2} describes the concentration of reduced acceptors, however it can be ignored in the simulation as it is a final byproduct.In C. violaceum the quorum sensing mechanism also produces an enzyme called HCN synthase, which we will call (E).We will use the quorum sensing model for Vibrio fischeri due to the similarities with the chemical species present in C. violaceum.In the process of bioleaching A. ferrooxidans can be considered a clean alternative because it does not produce toxic residues.Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a bacterium who usually lives in very acid environments (1.5-2 pH), it can be found mostly in acid mine drainage, and have the amazing property of being able to convert insoluble metals to their soluble state.For the regulation of the mechanism, a promoter inducible by dicyanoaurate(I) ion is used.The derivation of the Michaelis-Menten equation requires that the amount of synthase remains constant but this is not the case.Figure 3: Experimental data and fitted growth model of C. violaceum with growth rate constant (r = 0.0156\text{ min}^{-1}) and carrying capacity (K_P = 1.3344) OD(_{600}).C.To increase the efficiency of the process our team proposed a mechanism in which Tetrathionate Hydrolase (TetH) is produced.However, we expect population to show the following behavior: where (P_0) is the initial concentration: (P(0) = P_0).This way, overexpression will only happen in the presence of gold.Since there shouldn\x92t be any threats to the population during the project\x92s processes and the medium will be kept well nourished within the time it involves, it can be assumed that the population will grow until it reaches an equilibrium in the medium because of the limited carrying capacity.The differential equation that describes this behavior is: where (P) is the total C. violaceum concentration at a given moment, (r) is the growth rate and (K_P) is the carrying capacity.Its mechanism is extremely complicated due to the fact that it involves interactions between liquids and solids, it\x92s an heterogeneous reaction.Figure 6: This graph shows HCN synthase inside C. violaceum and in its membrane (in arbitrary units).However, as we have stated, cyanidation is not our main focus and we have found this to considerably simplify our simulations of the model while maintaining the rest of the processes intact.Figure 2: As LacI concentration goes down, the expression of TetH is allowed.Chromobacterium violaceum is defined as a saprophyte bacteria, which is normally considered to be nonpathogenic for humans, and it is found in soil and water samples of tropical and sub-tropical areas of several continents.The promoter for this cassette is activated by the presence of the dicyanoaurate(I) ion.(2009) The Chemistry of Gold Extraction.The reverse reaction of the dissolution inside the cells can be dismissed because of the lack of nucleation sites.This was derived from the consideration that the reaction speed depends upon the superficial area of solid gold.A limit is reached when there are no resources left for the enzyme to catalyze the production (i.e.Using a regression algorithm we obtained the growth rate constant (r) and the carrying capacity constant (K_P) resulting in a value of (\text{R}^2 = 0.9956).This equation will be solved numerically along with the ones presented in the following sections to facilitate their coupled solution.It was firstly observed during the second half of the XIX century and it was named after its violet coloration, which is given by violacein.We took into account an approximation of OD(_{600}) to number of cells (p=P\times10^8) ((P) being the population density in OD(_{600}) and described by equation eqref{eq:P}).To get a better insight of the behavior of our descriptions, we simulate the processes in Matlab®.Gold cyanidation is a complex process in which solid particles of gold are transformed into dicyanoaurate(I) ion (Au(CN)^?_2) in the presence of cyanide.', 'notebook': 'Also, transformations were made of RFP (20F) in E. coli culture media

introducing a new chassis to iGEM that can be transformed using the standard plasmid.Characterization of BBa_R0010 in Chromobacterium violaceumWe characterized the promoter BBa_R0010 in a novel chassis, C. violaceum.We measured the composition of the slag with the technique Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Juan José Cortés helped us with the procedure and we obtained these results.The weight of the dry slag after the digestion was 0.327 grams, therefore, the total grams of metal per gram of slag must be of 0.673, there are 0.0219 grams of metals left to calculate the composition so we asked Julio Rivera to conduct an ICP-OES to calculate them and we obtained these results.Therefore for our model, we know what is the maximum solubilization of metals.Heat shock transformation of Chromobacterium violaceum with the RFP-generator (BBa_J04450)We successfully transformed a novel chassis, Chromobacterium violaceum.There were no significant difference in the fluorescence of the between the induced and uninduced groups of C. violaceum, whereas in E. coli it showed normal induction and a clear difference of RFP expression when the inductor was added to the bacteria.We also showed that the part BBa_J04450 can be used as a reporter gene in a novel chassis, Chromobacterium violaceum.This part is a proton pump generator that is regulated by a weak constitutive promoter from the Anderson collection.However, in previous experiments we noticed that one of these two constructs actually reduced the viability of the bacteria, thus we determined it was not a reliable control group for our experiment.We adapted standardized E. coli protocols for calcium competency and heat shock transformation, successfully transforming C. violaceum.As seen in the figure, we tried preparing the calcium competent cells at different optical densities and transformed using different durations of heat shock.We transformed BL21 E. coli with three different constructs, one coding for the proton pump, and, as control groups, two constructs that consisted of the same plasmid as our proton pump (pUC-IDT, which has ampicillin resistance), but without the actual coding sequence for the proton pump.CueR is a transcription factor that stimulates the transcription at the pgolS promoter when bound to copper or gold, as was described by the iGEM York 2013.We calculated an average of the three replicates for each transformed strain and graphed the data in order to determine if the proton pump had a significant effect on the survivability of the bacteria.Thus, this construct increases its own expression through positive feedback in the presence of gold or copper through the production of a copper/gold sensitive protein.As the pgolS promoter has a basal transcription level, some CueR would be constantly expressed.Nevertheless, a basal activity for the fluorescence was found in the following graphWe used 2 different concentrations of copper as well as 4 different compositions of the shredded e-waste that CVR provided.Although transformation using an electroporation protocol had been described before, there was no previous report of a heat shock transformation of C. violaceum.The strain transformed with the proton pump had an exponential growth phase, while the others couldn\x92t resist the alkaline pH and had minimal growth.Additionally, we used the RFP-generator (BBa_J04450) in pSB1C3 in the transformation.This modification to bacterial cell membrane may increase stress resistance under alkaline conditions.Characterization of the golS promoter in Chromobacterium violaceumWe submitted a new part: BBa_K2055369.Our conclusion is that the promoter BBa_R0010 can be used as a constitutive promoter in C. violaceum.BBa_R0010 is lacI regulated, however, we were unable to confirm whether or not C. violaceum produces lacI natively through a literature search, and BLAST analysis of its genome suggested that it does not have this regulating system.This was necessary because, as C. violaceum produces a native purple pigment (violacein), we were curious as to whether RFP would be useful as a reporter gene.In C.Violaceum, this part expressing the RFP, did not presented an inducible activity in the e-waste copper and gold compositions that Tec-Monterrey 2016 worked with.', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'sequestering notoginseng

aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, into less toxic compounds using the degrading enzymes laccase and dioxygenase.It was uncertain whether the cells had the secretion system enzymes that would enable enzymes with a HlyA tag to be transported through the cell membranes.We chose a sensor that could react to salicylate when present; the production of our degrading enzymes would start in combination with a modified red fluorescent protein, dTomato, that indicates that there are PAHs present.The enzymes to convert naphthalene to salicylic acid is incorporated in a separate construct plasmid (you can read about this part of the project here).When attaching a signal sequence to a gene encoding an enzyme there can not be stop codons in between because the two genes need to be expressed together as one polypeptide chain.Two Nsil restriction sites were put before and after a 6xHis-tag so that the enzyme could be purified with an IMAC and so that the tag could be removed.It\x92s a 60 amino acid long sequence attached to the C-terminal of our enzymes.This protein functions as a repressor at the other promoter in this construct, the Psal promoter.The end product in the extradiol degradation pathway is an aldehyde which is much more harmful to the cell than a carboxylic acid (Bugg, 1 September 2003).The laccase and dioxygenase gets translated and transported to extracellular space thanks to the HlyA-tag (See secretion system).Because of the copresence of naphthalene and other PAHs in the environment, this is a suitable system design.The end product in the intradiol degradation pathway is a carboxylic acid which is unharmful to the cell and can be used in the bacteria s metabolism.When these compounds are being degraded by the expressed laccase and dioxygenase we want to have an indication that our system is working; one that could easily be detected.The switch is connected to a fluorescent reporter gene which will indicate when PAHs are present and hence when the construct is active.Among the existing approaches for measuring the strength of a promoter, we chose to use fluorometry with the RFP dTomato as a reporter gene.We also want to include an on and off switch to the degradation pathway so that we do not stress the cells when the enzymes are not needed.This sequence is recognized by the Type 1 secretion system (BBa_K1166002) .The enzymes were purified and measured for activity using enzyme kinetics.The methods that we used for this part of the project, we thus chose to describe them on a separate page.When induced the expression of the red fluorescent protein, dTomato, starts and the degradation part of the construct gets expressed.We found one interesting repressor system known as the NahR-Psal-promoter which is a promoter that is induced by compounds similar to salicylic acid.This type of enzyme is used to catalyze cleavage of the aromatic rings in our degradation pathway.One of the main parts of our whole system is the visual response of PAH degradation.The gene is followed by a KpnI restriction site with glycines and serines on each side, which are small amino acids which increase the flexibility of the protein.We faced the need to characterize a promoter system inhibited by the NahR protein, which is induced by salicylate.One of the promoters, the Pr promoter regulates the upstream sequence of the construct, which also contains the coding sequence for the NahR protein.We decided to test the expression of the NahR/Psal promoter system with different salicylate concentrations.To assemble the HlyA-tag with the enzymes without getting a scar, two different methods were tried.This is needed for the export tag HlyA , to make it easier for the resulting signal protein to be folded properly.A second KpnI restriction site is put after the HlyA so that the export tag can be removed easily.This enables extracellular degradation of PAH and therefore protects the cells from the toxic PAHs and its metabolites.The aim was to attach the HlyA-tag to the biobricks encoding the two laccases CotA and CueO as well as to the catechol-1,2-dioxygenase.It has then two stop codons, and a terminator at the end.A previous iGEM team, Peking 2013, inspired us to use the NahR construct (BBa_J61051), a system consisting of two promoters and a protein coding sequence.When salicylate binds to the NahR protein, the conformational change it undergoes makes transcription of the sequence upstream the Psal promoter possible.Contrary to the Pr promoter, the Psal promoter regulates transcription of genes downstream of the construct.The choice fell on fluorescent reporter genes, since measurement and quantification of the expression would be easier and less time-consuming.Inferring from the crystal structure of the enzyme, both its C and N termini do not participate in critical interactions within the enzyme, which makes them suitable sites for export tag fusion.The mutation has been proved to have more efficiency to degrade ABTS than the unmodified one.We choose to work with D439A/M510L due to its efficiency and the supposed impact it would have on our constructs degradation time (Kataoka, K et al.This construct was intended to be compared with a construct without the secretion system to see if any of them had exported proteins.', 'design': 'As such the Decyclifier reactor will need to be emptied and the remaining sludge deposited as was previously done, however now no longer containing PAHs.For the Decyclifier reactor we purpose a simple batch-mode model, due to the lengthy process of the PAH degradation (approximately 10 weeks for a 100 m3 batch).We suggest that these two types of ash should be sludged with water and supplied to the Decyclifier bioreactor.Judging from our tests in the lab, the Decyclifier is capable of surviving high concentrations of pure napththalene and can thus be assumed to also be able to survive fairly high concentrations of PAHs in the toxic ash.With utilization of our biosurfactant system and the optimized activity of our modified Laccase, one might assume that the Decyclifier reactor should be able to reach at least the higher level of purification, possibly also in shorter amount of time.Through the process, two types of ash contain considerably higher concentrations of PAHs.Based on similar reactors the inoculating concentration of the Decyclifier in the reactor should be about 50 g/kg.Due to the relative toxicity provided through other components of the ash, it is important to remember that the remaining material still needs to be disposed of after the reactor run time has finished.This would of course be a key experiment for the future assessment of the Decyclifier system.A key issue however is the fact that ash contains many other toxic substances in addition to PAHs.Preferably this reactor should be run using similar conditions as the main reactor to make sure that the cells are indeed functioning properly.It is hard to asses the actual building and maintenance cost of the system without proper knowledge of local conditions.As of yet no tests regarding the cells viability in direct contact with the ash has been performed.As such it will be necessary to also include a smaller pilot reactor for growth of the inoculating culture prior to PAH degradation.1: Input 2: Termometer 3: pH electrode 4: O2 electrode 5: Rotor 6: Gas input 7: Gas output 8: Acid/base input 9: Cooling jackets 10: Baffles 11: Fluorometer To implement the Decyclifier where it is most needed, in the waste plants, we designed a bioreactor (see figure 1) that would be part of the waste remediation process at facilities such as Uppsala Vattenfall\x92s power plant.', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'Figure 11 shows that the BaP degrading rate is not significantly affected by laccases and rhamnolipids being introduced in the system at time step 0 or 20.Laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the system at time step 0 or 20.Laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the system at time step 20.Laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the system at time step 20.Laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the system at time step 20.The number of BaPs in the system was studied during 500 time steps under different conditions; size of the interaction area, number of laccases, number of rhamnolipids and introduction method of laccases and rhamnolipids.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 10: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.In figure 12 introduction method A with laccases and rhamnolipids introduced to system at time step 0 is compared to B, continuous supply of laccases and rhamnolipids to the system, 1 laccase and 0, 1 or 2 rhamnolipids added every 5 time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 9: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 12: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.Figure 11: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.Figure 8: Number of BaPs in the system as a function of time steps.To study whether the introduction method of laccases and rhamnolipids into the system affect degradation of PaHs, different variations of our model were constructed.Laccases and rhamnolipids were either introduced continuously to the system, at the same time as the BaPs or some time steps after BaPs are introduced in the system.BaPs, laccases and rhamnolipids are introduced in the model with random positioning and for every time step they move randomly.By modelling the effect of the rhamnolipids in our system in Java we aim to create a visual and analytical tool for the extracellular reactions of the system during various time spans and concentrations of PAHs, laccases and rhamnolipids.Settings: 100 Baps displayed as blue molecules, 20 Rhamnolipids displayed as black molecules, 20 Laccases displayed as red dots and the delay between time steps set to 30 ms.The Simbiology model of the whole system proved the rate limiting enzymes in our system to be 2-hydroxybenzalpyruvatealdolase and 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, both parts of the naphthalene degrading pathway.As expected BaP degrading rate is higher in the beginning of the simulation for model A because of higher concentration of laccases and rhamnolipids.Graphs were produced using the mean value of the number of BaPs in the system for every measured time step.The Simbiology model showed us the rate-limiting step of our system, whilst the Java model showed that the system will indeed be improved by the presence of rhamnolipids.Not surprisingly, the degradation rate is higher the more laccases is present in the system.Figure 10 shows that degradation of 100 BaP is faster in a smaller space (650x650 pixels) compared to in a larger space (1000x1000 pixels) when all other settings are the same, BaP/laccase ratio is 5 and rhamnolipid/BaP ratio is 0, 0.2 or 0.5.This in turn causes the induction of our main system which finally results in the degradation of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.Concentration of naphthalene decreases over time at a slightly higher rate than the formation rate of salicylate.The main model has the initial value of 5 moles of naphthalene and 50 moles of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.This model will allow the user to get an overview of the laccase/rhamnolipid/PAH - system and how it works in theory as well as collecting data about the degraded PAHs over time during different conditions.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 20 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids in a 650x650 pixels interaction area.The initial values for the remaining substrate related components of the system was set to zero.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 10, 20 or 50 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids in a 650x650 pixels interaction area.This enabled analysis of the system as a whole with a slight focus on two of the different parts of the system.As such, the model only serves as a theoretic representation of the actual in vivo system but should still follow a similar pattern.These parameters can be analyzed separately for each part, or for the system as a whole.Figure 2 shows how the concentrations/proportions between the different components vary over time in relation to its initial values.Figure 9 shows how the breakdown rate of BaP depends on laccase and rhamnolipid concentration.Rhamnolipids can attach to the BaPs, and BaPs can form aggregates with other BaPs.These values are strictly arbitrary and serve only to create an initial outlook as to how the system behaves.One main model where the Decyclifier\x92s whole degrading system is represented, one where the naphthalene degrading pathway is represented and one where the salicylate-induced pathway is represented.BaP degradation rate for B is very low at the beginning because of low concentration of laccases and increases as the concentration of laccase increases.BaPs are less likely to form aggregates with other BaPs if rhamnolipids are attached to the BaPs.The model is a simple representation of our system with Rhamnolipids, BaPs and Laccases, where BaPs represent PAHs and Laccases represent both laccases and dioxygenases.Figure 4 shows the relationship between the different components of our naphthalene degrading pathway.The salicylate induced pathway has the initial value of 5 moles of salicylate and 50 moles of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene.Moreover, we seek to prove that our concept is valid and gauge the efficiency of the system.In addition, the relationship in amount between the BaPs and the laccases have merely been estimated and the size ratio in our visual representation is completely unrealistic.Doing so saved us from having to deal with the convoluted differential equations that inevitably follow from a system as complex as ours.Another major difference is that in our model, degraded BaPs simply disappear, as opposed to turning into the degradation product.The naphthalene degrading model has the initial value of 5 moles of naphthalene.Due to the complexity of the real system, strictly arbitrary values regarding association, dissociation and breakdown of the respective components had to be decided.Laccases degrade BaPs with higher probability if they are not in aggregates due to the increased probability of the enzyme s active site to reach the BaP.In figures 8 to 12 we see the effect of varying rhamnolipid concentrations in the system.It is clear from figure 9 that the ratio of laccase/BaP causes a greater degradation rate effect of BaP than the ratio of rhamnolipid/BaP.The collected data can give us an insight as to what degree the rhamnolipids improves the action of the laccase, and also what ratios that give the optimal enzyme activity.By modelling our system in Simbiology we aim to obtain a further understanding of the parameters that rule the whole Decyclifier system.The values are the average of 100 simulations with the same settings.This is likely due to the increased probability of two molecules encountering each other in a smaller space.The amount of dissolved benzo(a)pyrene decreases as well while the amount of intermediate breakdown product and the dioxygenase product, here annotated as unknown product increases.This is mainly due to the fact that the laccase in reality is so much larger than the BaPs, which would make a visual representation very hard to interpret.Due to the fact that most of these reactions are catalyzed with a single substrate, this serves as a fair approximation.In some cases, the data pertaining to the enzyme with our substrate in Pseudomonas putida was not available, and we had to resort to using related values.Initial settings: 100 BaPs, 20 laccases and 0, 20 or 50 rhamnolipids.', 'notebook': 'The products were run on a gel and this showed that the PCR was unsuccessful.A transformation on the ligations with CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2 dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag gene were transformed but with no results.Large overnight on the dioxygenase and the HlyA-tag with the J23110 promoter was made.We started assembling on of the laccase genes, CueO with the NahR and reporter gene system, while also continuing the assembly of the final enzymatic degradation construct by adding the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase after the modified laccase gene.We transformed our rhamnolipid construct in BL21D3 cells due to poor expression of mono-rhamnolipids in DH5?.Performed TLC test on the expressions from the rhamnolipid construct.Primers were designed for PCR extraction of the naphthalene upper pathway of the Nah7 plasmid from Pseudomonas putida, and to remove T7-promoters from CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase biobricks.rhlA and rhlB genes from the DNA distribution kit were transformed into E.coli DH5? and plasmid preparations were made.Transformations were done to insert biobricks with the enzymes CueO, CotA, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and the HlyA-tag genes into DH5?.We did the second PCR in the restriction free cloning with the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag gene.Since we didn\x92t get any growth with CotA and HlyA-tag we decided to abandon the CotA enzyme.Ligation of the biobricks CueO and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with a standard promoter (BBa_J23110) were preformed.Performed digestion with KpnI restriction enzyme on the modified laccase sequence to remove the export HlyA-tag sequence.The products were loaded on a 2% gel and extracted to be used in the next step.We did a new 3A assembly with the correct HlyA-tag and our enzymes CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase.We also designed primers to do overlap extension PCR to remove the scar that was created when attaching the HlyA-tag with the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase genes.Stock solutions and agar plates with and without antibiotic resistance were made.Primers were designed for site directed mutagenesis to eliminate the restrictions sites for improving the NoKoGen biobricks, and primers were also designed for restriction free cloning to assemble the HlyA-tag with the CueO, CotA and dioxygenase genes, without creating a scar.It indicated presence of rhamnolipids.Analyzed differences in survivability between cells containing the naphthalene degrading pathway and negative control cells containing an RFP-coding gene by adding fixed amounts of naphthalene crystals in the lid of the agar plates.The RFC products with CueO containing the HlyA-tag and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag were sent for sequencing.Assembled dTomato construct at the end of our full rhamnolipid construct by 3A assembly.The CueO, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and the modified laccase genes was assembled with a secretion system.Phusion and Pfu was extracted from bacteria.Removed two PstI restriction sites from the naphthalene pathway through site-directed mutagenesis.The restriction free cloning for CueO and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase genes with the HlyA-tag was successfully executed.The first step in the restriction free cloning was done with the genes for the enzymes CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with the HlyA-tag.The CueO and the modified laccase genes were transformed into BL21DE3 cells.This as a preparation for building the biosurfactant construct.A first attempt to remove the T7-promoter from the biobricks with CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was done.Big overnights of BL21DE3 cells with catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, CueO and the modified laccase were made.Extraction and purification of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, CueO and the modified laccase.The rhamnolipid constructs was in pSB3K3, so they were transferred to pSB1C3 backbone as a biobrick requirement.The tested cells and its supernatants came from the transformation cultures of DH5? and BL21DE3 with promoters (BBa_J23101) and (BBa_J23110) as well as a DH5? with a simple RFP insert as a negative control.An anion-exchange chromatography was done to extract catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from cell lysate.touchdown protocol, gradients and adding DMSO was tried to remove the T7-promoter from the CueO, CotA and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase biobricks.Therefore the first PCR of the RFC was redone.The HlyA-tag was attached to the two laccases CueO and CotA that we had successfully removed the T7-promoter from with 3A assembly.The gel showed that the PCR had not worked.Since the NoKoGen biobricks had already been improved, transformation were done with the improved biobricks of rhlA, rhlB, and with RBS and the (BBa_J23101) promoter from the kit into DH5?.It was transformed into DH5? and the cultures were used for plasmid preparation to extract the DNA.Transformed our full construct with (BBa_J23101) promoter, RBS, rhlA and rhlB into DH5? cells.Frozen stock and plasmid preparations were made of these.Transformed the NahR construct, dTomato and super yellow fluorescent protein 2 (SYFP2), as well as plasmid prepared the transformed DNA and evaluated with PCR followed by further evaluation by agarose gel electrophoresis.Designed primers for sequencing of the Nah7 pathway, as well as primers flanking the entire pathway.The modified laccase gene without the export tag was also transformed into BL21DE3.Analysed the growth of our cells with the naphthalene degrading pathway with no naphthalene present, naphthalene present directly in cell culture and gaseous naphthalene presence.These pictures shows liquid culture containing naphthalene degrading pathway or red insert, where there is either no naphthalene present, naphthalene present directly in culture or gaseous naphthalene present.The reporter gene sequences and the modified laccase sequence were also assembled with two different Anderson promoters, (BBa_J23110) and (BBa_J23101).Grew bacteria containing Phusion and Pfu overnight in liquid medium.Made an attempt to extract the Nah7 plasmid using the designed

engine\x92s efficiency, and increased amounts of CO and soot emission (due to more unburnt C content in the exhaust now).Hence, cloning the SQR gene is important, as it will convert the toxic waste gas hydrogen sulfide to sulfur, which is a solid product and can therefore be separated out with ease.1.The biobrick BBa_K896000 (Sqr), previously submitted by NYMU iGEM 2012 team, was obtained from iGEM repository.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BBa_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.At high concentrations of Sodium nitrite, the OD values showed a sharp decline, which can again be attributed to high concentrations of nitrite (>2mM) being toxic to the cells.6.Nessler\x92s test (LB growth)- Cultures of our clones were grown anaerobically in 5ml of luria broth, along with standard DH5? cells, used as control.NO is found primarily in motor exhausts, and Oxides of nitrogen (NOX) are key oxidants that have a role in the photochemical production of ozone, whilst also being linked with an increase in the oxidising capacity of the atmosphere.The nitrite reductase NrfA is encoded within the nrfA operon that is found in enteric bacteria such as E. coli.But most of the E-coli strains do not possess an efficient heme transport system and thus uptake of hemin solely relies on diffusion through the cell membrane.ChuA :It is basically a heme-transport protein which helps in utilisation of Hemin NADPH-sulfite reductase (SiR) of Escherichia coli catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide and is required for synthesis of L-cysteine from inorganic sulfateThe native enzyme has a subunit structure a8B4 , where a8 is a flavoprotein (SiR-FP) containing both flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide and P is a hemoprotein (SiR-HP) containing an Fe4S4 centre and a single molecule of sirohemeElectron flow between these cofactors proceeds from NADPH to flavin adenine dinucleotide to flavin mononucleotide in the flavoprotein, then to a closely coupled Fe4S4 siroheme center in the hemoprotein, and finally from siroheme to sulphiteThe SiR-FP and SiR-HP components of SiR are encoded by cysJ and cysl, respectively.Thus, if an efficient and cost effective design of this NRFA driven pollution crusader device is realized, it would bring about a remarkable change in the automobile and diesel engine industry, and increase the efficiency of these devices, while reducing both the cost, and carbon footprints on the environment.We were able to materialize our dream of designing the perfect "Pollution Crusader" prototype model, using the genetically engineered Eco.coli bacteria, to a very good extent, if not fully.From the viewpoint of Synthetic Biology, we succeeded in obtaining the desired clones.The reduction of nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen requires two protons and two electrons, according to the equationN2O + 2H+ + 2e? ? N2 + H2O, E°? (pH 7.0) = 1.35 V; ?G0? = ?339.5 kJ/mol This is a challenging reaction to be catalyzed by a metalloenzyme, as nitrous oxide is not just kinetically inert to decomposition but also a poor transition metal ligand, due to its weak ?-donating and ?-accepting properties.Although, there have been some reports of other enzymes, such as nitrogenase and a multicopper oxidase from Pyrobaculum aerophilum, able to catalyze this reaction in vitro, the only one, whose primary role is the reduction of nitrous oxide, is N2O reductase (NosZ) The general cloning strategy for P+RBS+NosZ+SYFP consists of the following steps.1.The biobrick BBa_K1866001 (NosZ+SYFP) was prepared by Team IIT Delhi iGEM 2015.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BB_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.These genes are contiguous and together with cysH, the gene for 3 -phosphoadenosine 5 -phosphosulfate sulfotransferase, comprise an operon with the gene order promoter-cysJ-cysI-cysHcysJIH operon is part of the positively regulated cysteine regulon (15) and requires sulfur limitationSiR activity is also dependent on cysG, which encodes a uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase necessary for the synthesis of siroheme This gene is located more than 10 min away from cysJIH on the chromosomal map (34) and is not tightly regulated as part of the cysteine regulatory 1.To characterise the Promoter + RBS + nrfA biobrick (Bba_K1866000), we first ran the total protein content of our recombinant E.coli DH5? culture (into which our pSB1A3 plasmid containing the biobrick had been cloned) on an SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel.The stereochemistry of heme attachment is the same in all known examples of heme c, and the vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are attached to the N- and C-terminal Cys of the CXXCH motif, respectively.Other, less common, derivatives of heme include heme d1, present in cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase, heme a, found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the related heme o, found in some bacterial oxidases.From a chemical perspective, hemes b and c are very similar to each other and thus are not expected to display significant inherent differences in electronic structure or reduction potential.In a nutshell, our prototype model is capable of removing the harmful soot particles, gases like NOx and SOx and also the particulate matter present in the exhaust gases of the various engines being used.This was a remarkable discovery as the NRFA bacteria we are working with, effectively reduce NO into harmless forms, and hence we needed NO as the output from this tank.This will also further reduce environmental repercussions as soot now is converted into a useful product, rather than being dumped into the environment To work on developing and optimizing the desooter tank design to reduce power consumption in the blower, as well as the heat exchanger.After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and the pH of the solution was taken for all different concentrations of Nitrite.One of the pathways to its destruction is reduction to molecular nitrogen by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase found in denitrifying bacteria.NosZ, a gene coding for nitrous oxide reductase, isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, is known to convert N2O to harmless Nitrogen gas (N2).After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and nessler\x92s reagent was added to a 1ml aliquot.These OD values were plotted against DH5? culture, used as control for the experiments.a.Monitoring with time- For a concentration of 1mM Nitrite, multiple cultures were inoculated.The NrfA nitrite reductase is a membrane-associated respiratory enzyme that couples to the membrane-associated formate-oxidizing enzymes via quinones in order to generate membrane potential.The desooter tank has the following main design components: The exhaust gases enter the desooter tank at high temperature(200-250 C), and hence they cause the water in the tank to evaporate when they pass through it.Thus, the tank containing this solvent dissolves soot and NOx, Sox gases move out with the exhaust.The reason for this repression at high nitrite concentrations is the presence of two regulators of the nrfA gene, NarL and NarP, in the E.coli K-12 genome (from where this gene has been isolated).The OD values were more than that of DH5? cultures throughout, pointing to the fact that more ammonia was being formed in our clone cultures.b.Monitoring with different nitrite concentrations- 50 ml Cultures were inoculated with different concentrations of Sodium nitrite.Finally, we came to the conclusion that while expressing NrfA in a constitutive fashion, there was increased conversion of NOx to ammonia.The NirB nitrite reductase is a soluble siroheme-containing enzyme that uses NADH as an electron donor to reduce nitrite in the cytoplasm.Also, another important product of the reaction, NAD(P)+ act as reducing equivalents that are an inherent part of the electron transport system in the host.The nrfA gene is suppressed at higher levels of nitrite or nitrate.Under the constraints of time, we managed to compile the literature, designed the perfect strategy and using Copasi (modelling tool), we found some novel pathways to regulate and manipulate the increase in Heme production and hence the activity of the Heme proteins.It has two copper centers, a binuclear CuA center, similar to the one found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the CuZ center, a unique tetranuclear copper center now known to possess either one or two sulfide bridges[3].(P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.6.The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, whose atmospheric concentration has been increasing since the introduction of the Haber Bosch process led to the widespread use of nitrogenous fertilizers.The remaining exhaust, congaing NOx, Sox and some amount of water vapor now passes over the silica gel tank at the outlet of this desooter tank.SC-R\x92s are not efficient enough, and thus, do not lead to a significant increase in the trade-off temperature.Nitric oxide (NO) is a proposed intermediate in the six-electron reduction of nitrite and NrfA can use exogenous NO as a substrate.It\x92s a cross flow type heat exchanger, with which we did some slight innovations to increase the efficiency of the condensation process.Being an acid, it reduces the PH of the medium and hence decreases the solubility of acidic NOx and SOx, from the exhaust into this solvent.From a biosynthetic perspective, however, these types of heme are quite different; because heme c is synthesized from heme b, the use of heme c requires a greater investment from the organism.However, the overall reaction is given by:Thus, the six electron reduction of NO2- to NH3 is catalysed by the nitrite reductase nrfA.NOx sensors placed at the edge of the silica gel tube confirmed that the gel was catalysing the reaction that we intended to do, converting NO2 to NO.To optimize the design of the desooter tank and the entire contraption, to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the process.We tested the model against the exhaust emitted by a diesel engine.But the end product heme acts as a feedback regulator of ALA synthase thereby inhibiting its production.Incomplete heme incorporation into recombinant protein has been a frequently encountered problem .A population of protein will fold without heme cofactor under condition where folding outspaces heme delivery Natural modi?cations to heme occur after the ferrous iron (Fe2) is inserted into the porphyrin by ferrochelatase, the last enzyme in heme biosynthesisCCm complex : It is a complex of Transmembrane protein which helps in Heme maturation .From modelling we believe that by upregulating CCm complex of proteins we can increase heme incorporation into our proteins.We also saw that at concentrations of Nitrite greater than 2mM, the pH showed a sharp decline.Hence, a level meter is required to keep a check on the water level left in the tank, and hence supply fresh water accordingly through the fresh water inlet.While no intermediates of the reaction are released, NrfA is also able to reduce various oxides other than NO such as, hydroxylamine (H2NOH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), but notably also sulfite(SO32-), providing the only known direct link between the nitrogen and sulfur cycles.While scavenging the research papers, we found out that nobody, till date had found a perfect solution for the over expression of Heme protein.In the past, motor vehicle exhaust was an important, but not the main, source of sulfur dioxide in air.This experiment was also successful, with OD values showing a trend similar to the one above.1.The biobrick BBa_K1153001 (NrfA), previously submitted by KENT iGEM 2013 team, was obtained from iGEM repository.2.Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BBa_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.3.The digestion products were resolved on an Agarose Gel by Electrophoresis and the size of the fragment confirmed the correct clone.The biggest problem which we encountered was that the heme synthesis was much less as compared to our overexpressed protein.The experiment showed results as expected, with the pH of our clones being higher than the control, which can be attributed to the presence of excess ammonia in the solution.For this, we attach a heat exchanger at the outlet of the tank.Escherichia coli possesses two biochemically distinct nitrite reductase enzymes encoded by the nrfABCDEFG and nirBDC operons.We did manage to extensively characterize the NrfA cloned gene, which served as the nitrate reductase.Nitrite, the substrate for the two enzymes, must either be encountered environmentally or generated by the cell from nitrate reduction by one of the three E. coli nitrate reductases.The initial plan was to clone this gene downstream of the CysI gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which codes for sulfite reductase, catalysing the conversion of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide (H2S).So we decided to eliminate soot and NOx as the primary objective.Research was done extensively and the following genes were found to be best fitting for our project-Since Nitric oxide NO is a major greenhouse gas, the reduction of NO from the air is an important task to address global warming concerns.To get rid of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, we decided to use a solution of acetic acid in water as the solvent.This could be due to the fact that high concentrations of nitrite (NO¬2-) become toxic for the cells, due to which cell death occurs.The exhaust out of this tank is now passed into the desooter tank.Thus, the NO rich gas from this tank is passed into the next tank containing NRFA bacteria for further action.This was required so that these excess water vapor do not clog the silica gel at the outlet of the tank.After 16 hours of growth, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD Values were taken.However, we later realised that the pellet was not of our cells, but of ampicillin, which had formed some sort of white precipitate with the media.Conventionally, diesel engines are operated at temperature ranges which are not very high, as operation at high temperature leads to higher amount of NOx in the exhaust.This enzyme is a periplasmic protein and therefore contains a signal sequence to redirect it to the periplasmic space after the protein is formed.The result showed over expression in the range of 55 kDa, which is roughly equal to the size of our protein.2.Periplasmic protein SDS-PAGE\x97following the over expression obtained from the Poly Acrylamide gel electrophoresis, we extracted the protein content from the periplasmic space using the periplasm fractionation protocol.While working in the project, towards the end, the main complexity we faced was of Heme protein.This culture was then centrifuged at maximum speed (13,400 rpm) for 10 minutes, and the media was decanted and dried out, leaving only the red ammonia pellet.154:349\x96354 9.Optimization of the heme biosynthesis pathway for the production of 5-aminolevulinic acid in Escherichia coli, Junli Zhang Zhen Kang Jian Chen Guocheng Du 10.The Chemistry and Biochemistry of Heme c: Functional Bases for Covalent Attachment, Sarah E. J.At high nitrite concentrations, the pellet size reduced drastically (the reason being toxicity at high nitrite concentration).1.Clarke, TA., Mills, PC.We observed considerable reduction in the amount of NOx and SOx reduced.We further instigated the problem and found that one of the largest contributions to rising pollution in Delhi is the exhaust from automobiles and other devices using petrol and diesel as fuel.Use the soot (obtained as dissolved in water) to make ink to ultimately make the process self-sustainable and bring down the processing cost to negligible amounts by accounting for commercial selling of this ink obtained.Spargers are needed to form bubbles of exhaust gas in the mixture.The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur.The pathway of the nrfA Gene is still not completely understood or characterised.(P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.6.The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.We performed a double digestion by EcoRI and PstI to release the cloned fragment from the recombinant vector.These ball bearings, through conduction, cool down to acquire the temperature(similar to) of the flow pipes and hence increase the surface area available to the vapor for condensation, speeding up the condensation process.After regular intervals of time, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD540 values were noted.This was run on another polyacrylamide gel, and we saw over expression on this gel as well, on the appropriate range.3.Minimal media growth- Following a research paper by Clarke et al., a culture of our cloned E.coli DH5? culture was grown on a minimal media containing 5% Luria Broth (by volume), 40mM Potassium Nitrate, 20mM Fumarate and 0.4% glycerol for 16 hours, in anaerobic conditions.U.S. EPA then includes these sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) and targets them for federal clean-up activities.We have been successful in cloning a total of 5 relevant bio bricks:We have submitted these parts in the iGEM registry for future use by any iGEM team.U.S. EPA has found hydrogen sulfide in at least 35 of the 1,689 current or former NPL sites.Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) prosthetic groups perform a wide range of functions in nature includingHeme c: heme c has two covalent thioether bonds formed between Cys side chains and the heme vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 .Delhi has been ranked the first most polluted metropolis in the world, and is one of the most heavily polluted cities in India.In the mechanical half of the project, we designed a prototype which in effect served as the perfect \x93Pollution Crusader\x94.Blowers are also attached to the system to compensate for the back pressure generated in the system at each step.Cold water flows through the exchanger pipes and steam flows on the outside.In the period between 2000-2011, PM10 levels in Delhi s air jumped by as much as 47 per cent.While either NarL or NarP was able to induce nrfA-lacZ expression in response to low levels of nitrate, only NarL could repress at high nitrate levels.This problem could therefore, be solved, by expressing the nitrite reductase gene under a constitutive strong promoter, which is what we have done.The prototype model designed will not only serve as an alternative for the existing technology, but has the potential to bring revolutionary changes in the upcoming days.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the nation.We here filled the outside of the pipe portion of the exchanger with metal ball bearings.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'iGEM team IIT Delhi put up a stall in this event with the goal to motivate and encourage school students to develop a greater interest in Biology and Biotechnology.This was essentially done to help the freshmen develop an interest in synthetic biology and hopefully carry on the

'modeling': 'Heme functions as a feedback inhibitor, repressing transcription of the gene for ?-Aminolevulinate Synthase.A non-competitive irreversible feedback inhibition model is assumed for this step with a Ki value of 0.02 mM.Of the proteins used in our project, three of them are Cytochrome C protein, wherein Heme has a very important role to play.?-Aminolevulinate Synthase (ALA Synthase) is the committed step of the heme synthesis pathway, and is usually rate-limiting for the overall pathway.As heme synthesis was our fundamental problem, we put on a lot of efforts in modelling it properly.However, the pathway of Heme biosynthesis is extremely complicated.Hence, the following equation governs the production of ALA:The rest of the reactions in this pathway are assumed to proceed via Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics: After putting in the rate laws and the values of various parameters in Copasi software, following graphs were obtained for the concentrations and rate of formation of various species involved (Copasi has been used for obtaining all graphs and mathematical equations):The following are the differential equations associated with the above processes:After production of ferroheme, the cytochrome \x96c protein and the ferroheme are transported to the periplasm, where they form a complex via covalent bonding.After this, the following reactions take place, depending

each of the assembles.', 'design': 'Again, because of the mixed site formed by the ligation between XbaI and SpeI, which translates as a stop codon, we chose to add a NdeI site between the prefix and the sequence in the case of GFP and between the suffix and the sequence for Lcp and RoxA.To perform the fusion of these proteins, we had to add a SacI site between the protein sequence and the suffix (for signal TAT) and prefix (for RoxA and Lcp).Although our priority was the first assembly once Lcp is already translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the twin-arginine translocation pathway (TAT) in its organism of origin, we planned other assemblies to test which of the exportation systems would be best for Lcp and RoxA individually.Another modification was a linker (represented in grey in the sequence below) add so the GFP wouldn\x92t interfere with Lcp and RoxA folding.Tetracycline would be produced at the same time as Lcp and RoxA, inhibiting the expression of hokD.In this case, GFP would be produced if the E. coli grew in a medium lacking the inductor.Another possibility explored in our project was the fusion of RoxA and Lcp to OmpA (Outer membrane protein A), leading to the transport of RoxA to the bacterium external surface.One of them was the signal TAT, in addition to its sequence this part had the prefix and suffix used in biobricks as well as a SacI site.Knowing that heterologous expression in E. coli of the entire Lcp sequence of Streptomyces sp.We received Lcp and RoxA sequences optimized for E. coli cloned in pUC9 from Prof. Dr. Dieter Jendrossek and the first thing we did was check their biobrick compatibility searching for EcoRI, PstI, SpeI and XbaI sites.An easy way to see the expression of folded Lcp and RoxA is to fusion a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).As we said before, the attempts to express RoxA in E. coli were frustrated due to the formation of inclusion bodies.In this case we had to change a thymine for a cytosine in the blue area from 282 to 284 bases to eliminate an undesirable NdeI site.Some of the parts we needed for the main assembly and exportation test were synthesized as gBlocks® Gene Fragments by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).As mentioned before, we planned a test to check which of the exportation systems was better for each of the enzymes.\x93Secretion and transcriptional regulation of the latex-clearing protein, Lcp, by the rubber-degrading bacterium Streptomyces sp.Another part we decided to synthesize was the GFP used in the exportation tests.The idea is that in the presence of the inductor (arabinose, rhamnose or IPTG) the bacteria produces GFP and tetracycline, which will inhibits the production of RFP and in the absence of the inductor the production of GFP and tetracycline would cease and the production of RFP would get higher.K30, including the TAT signal peptide, was successful 1, we decided to use the twin-arginine translocation (TAT) signal as a way to export Lcp and RoxA, increasing the chances that RoxA would acquire a functional folding.As soon as the bacteria stopped receiving rhamnose the production of tetR would end allowing the expression of hokD and cell death.Another crucial part of our main circuit was the kill-switch, ensuring that our E. coli wouldn\x92t survive outside of the bioreactor.', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'To have a quantitative understanding of our circuit and test other possibilities, we have developed models to predict gene expression and chemical interactions based on stochastic processes and differential equations.', 'notebook': 'If they leave the bioreactor, sok won\x92t be produced, and the cell will die due to hok presence.For cells that didn\x92t inherited the developed DNA circuit: these will contain Hok in their plasma, but not sok - this is due to the difference in their degradation rates; while sok has a half life of 30 seconds, the half life of hok is much higher: of 30 minutes.Both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don\x92t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.Additionally, both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don\x92t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.In order for it not to be produced in higher concentrations than necessary, which can lead to the risk of it not being completely inhibited by sok, we have inserted only one hok sequence in this design.While the cells contain the DNA circuit and are inside the bioreactor, they will produce both the toxin and antitoxin, and will live.Therefore, the developed bacteria wouldn\x92t be producing neither Lcp nor roxA, presenting no threats to usable rubber or to the environment.Although the simplified Hok-Sok kill switch mechanism proposed by our team allows, with low energy cost, the efficient and rapid death of the cells after leaving the bioreactor, it doesn\x92t grant that cells inside the bioreactor which didn\x92t inherit the developed DNA circuit die.As we use inducible promoters for producing the rubber degrading enzymes, if rhamnose isn\x92t present on the environment, our genic circuit is off - presenting no threats.None of the used DNA parts in the main circuit has any direct relation with virulence and the organism presents low pathogenicity, besides being a commonly found bacteria.Besides the plasmid having an antibiotic resistance related part- on our first project design -, it is a known and common sequence, which can be easily obtained by DNA synthesis or acquiring the plasmid commercially, for example.If the bacteria is released from the bioreactor, it will be in an environment without rhamnose, and won t produce tetR - leading to the production of HokD, a protein that causes cell membrane depolarization, killing the microorganism.As the bacteria desired to survive will contain a plasmid with antibiotic resistance, it won\x92t die - and all of the other bacteria will.This may be a problem to the process efficiency, as cells that aren\x92t developing the desired processes will be competing for nutrients with the ones that contain the DNA circuit.A kill switch mechanism designed to be activated when the bacteria leaves the bioreactor was included in our DNA circuit.Brasil-USP team is very concerned about the project\x92s biosafety, and considered it not only while working in the wet lab but also while designing our biological system.These acts as a physical containment for the developed bacteria and, therefore, minimize the risks of releasing it unexpectedly to the environment.Also, as these processes are being idealized to be performed in factories, only few people of the staff would have contact with the developed microorganism; and these would be specifically trained to minimize contamination - granting an even lower chance of the microorganism being released unexpectedly.The main molecule produced in this process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al), however there are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, it will be produced constantly while the cell is inside the bioreactor.The hok system promoter is changed to a constitutive one - so it will also be produced constantly.All the procedures applied in our team\x92s project have been discussed with the members and no safety concerns were raised.Conditional suicide system for the containment of bacteria and plasmids.Our circuit uses inducible promoters (BBa_K91403; BBa_R0080; BBa_R0010), so if the trigger reactant isn\x92t present our genic circuit is off, not producing the ODTD molecule, which might be toxic to the environment.This is how it works: the bacterial culture medium will contain rhamnose, activating the left part of our designed DNA circuit (Figure 1).In order to eliminate this issue, our team proposed inserting our circuit and the antibiotic resistance into the genome of the developed bacteria - avoiding horizontal gene transfer and the creation of potentially dangerous organisms.Therefore, no relevant risks to the environment were detected.On our first project design, however, we still depend on antibiotic resistance for maintenance of the desired plasmid.There are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.Therefore, this strain is classificated in Risk group 1, and it meets the requirements of the US NIH.As the continuum use of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria and has been avoided by scientific community5, our team proposes a circuit that would be able to control these problems.The main molecule produced in this process is the 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD).Additionally, the E. coli BL21, contains several mutations silenced, and does not compete in the environment.It will not be constructed due to time issues, but it is idealized here (Figure 2).The circuits includes sok, a RNA antitoxin, under the rhamnose promoter; tetR is removed from the circuit.We are using a strain of E. coli that it s not supposed to survive greatly in the environment.In order to minimize the release of the developed bacteria to the environment, we were very careful in the disposal of biological material at the laboratory.For the proposed project, these contaminations will be controlled using antibiotics.All of the students involved in our project have received safety instructions for working at the laboratory.According to the DSMZ database, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are from the risk group 1, and does not offer any disease on healthy adult humans.For the Interlab study, we used E. Coli DH5-?.Unfortunately, physical containment alone isn\x92t enough to ensure that the GMO\x92s won\x92t be released accidentally.If the kill switch fails, the bacteria will only survive in extreme conditions, which was a low probability to occur.O.

Gerdes Escherichia coli in the Environment: Implications for Water Quality and Human Health.All of the knowledge obtained in the course was applied on the project developed for iGEM.Graduated students have attended a course offered by São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC/USP) about basic safety aspects, and then instructed undergraduate students about the precautions to be taken.The course included topics such as: the use of appropriated clothing and personal protective equipment; correct use of equipments such as autoclave, laminar hood flow, electrophoresis chamber and centrifuge; handling safety aspects and disposal of biological and chemical agents; specific danger of the main reagents used at the lab; and precautions about bioaerosol.The mechanism is expected to kill the cells almost immediately, with only a fraction of 1.4 x 10-4 the cells surviving after 90 minutes4.Therefore, the system is efficient for containing the microorganism spreading and its modified DNA transmission.', 'protocol': 'Add ethidium bromide and after, transfer the melted gel into a gasket in a gel caster support with an appropriate comb);Load the DNA ladder into the first well of the gel and the samples into the additional wells;Directed mutagenesis PCR for restriction site elimination using a plasmid template5 ?l of each primer forward and reverse (diluted to 20?M) previously designed and purchased;Second (18X): 95°C for 30s; 60°C for 30s (primers Tm); 72°C for 5 min (15-30s per kb - pUC9::roxA : 4462 bp)Run a gel electrophoresis to analysis (10 ?l) and purification (all remainder reaction);Confirm the mutation with a digest reaction with two enzymes, one vector site containing and with the desired mutation site.Recommended 0.03 - 0.2 pmol; pmol [ gBlock =left (frac{weight}{bp x 650 Daltons} \right )left (1000 \right )]E. coli cells transformed were plated on LB agar (Sigma) plates supplemented with antibiotic:Tip 1 colony from the LB agar plates into independent sterile tubes with 5 ml of LB media (1:4) containing antibioticRepeat the previous step twice for 2 different colonies to obtain biological replicate.Using a clear, flat- or round-bottomed, 96-well plate we measured optical density at 600 nm (OD600).usually in a proportion 1:10 we obtained OD600 ~ 0.1 with the previous pre-inoculum conditionsUsing a black, flat-bottomed, 96-well plate we measured fluorescence adjusting excitation and emission wavelength according to the fluorescent molecule.usually in a proportion 1:10 we obtained OD600 ~ 0.1 with the previous pre-inoculum conditionsInduction response must be observed in time due to cellular growth and consequent gene expression.Directed mutagenesis PCR for restriction site elimination using a plasmid template Sterile LB agar plate supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (ampicillin 100 ?g ml-1 or chloramphenicol 34 ?g ml-1 - SIGMA-ALDRICH®);Competent DH5?

Coli without plasmid), confirmed by a Mann-Whitney U test.However, it is known that TatA is the most expressed gene of this pathway and it has 60% of homology with TatE, which can partially substitute TatA; TaTB can form a complex with TatC to prevent its degradation; there is evidence that TatC is the signal peptide binding protein and, finally, TatD produces no effect on protein translocation but has DNase activity.5 The secretion is composed by 12-16 different proteins, but none of these proteins have their specific roles elucidated.5 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The ompA mechanism is inserted in the type I secretion system which, in Gram negative bacteria, promotes the secretion of various proteins of different sizes and functions in one single step, without the necessity of a periplasmic intermediate.The proposed circuit provides the secretion of the proteins by the fusion with a specific signal sequence, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence, or its binding to the bacterial outer membrane by the fusion with a specific protein, OmpA fused with a linker (BBa_K1489002).We show in figures 2 and 3 our results.Figure 2 - Optical Density (OD) measurements over time, showing that all colonies were in their log phase.Figure 3 - Fluorescence per cell for each promoter, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.The first one aims to get the protein through the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and, for that, it can use three different pathways (the SecB-dependent pathway, the signal recognition particle (SRP), and the twin-arginine translocation (TAT)).Our results are in figure 4 and 5.Figure 4 - Fluorescence per cell for pLac, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.Unfortunately we weren\x92t able to perform these tests, first due to our problems with promoter test and second because we are still in the circuit construction phase.We see that with IPTG, GFP activity incresases and RFP activity decreases, as it should happen.Figure 5 - Fluorescence per cell for each promoter, normalized by the fluorescence with no induction.The second step is the protein translocation through the outer membrane, involving specific protein machinery known as the secreton.5 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The TAT pathway, unlike the SecB or the SRP pathways, is capable of transporting folded proteins across the inner membrane independently of ATP using the transmembrane PMF (proton-motive force).5 This translocation system is composed mainly of five proteins (TatA, TatB, TatC, TatD and TatE) but their specific function have not been firmly established yet.Therefor we planned circuits with two exportation systems, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence and the fusion of the enzymes with the bacterial outer membrane, OmpA, to check which of these exportation systems were better for each of the enzymes.Not only the induced activity is lower than the activity without induction - for the first 3 concentrations of Rhamnose -, but also the RFP is also growing.BBa_K1819008 was submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts as a Brasil-USP team new part.Moreover, there are several large scale system established for E. coli use in industry and, since our project aim for industrial applications, we have chosen the E. coli system allied with the previously named secretion routes that might help increase enzymes  stability.Another possibility for our negative results is the wrong ligations between the parts, that again we just confirmed by agarose gel instead of sequencing.Figure 6 - Exportation test circuits (more information about the design of the circuits here).The protein being transported has a specific C-terminal signal sequence that usually has few to 50 glycine rich-repeats, that might be necessary for the protein function and, therefore, is not cleaved during the secretion6.These enzymes are fundamental for rubber degradation and have to be secreted or exposed in the exterior of the cell to be in direct contact with their substrate, the poly(cis-1,4 isoprene) - the main component of rubber.The exportation of RoxA ensures its passage through the bacterial periplasm which increases the chances of a correct folding of the protein.The designed circuits are shown in the figure below (Figure 6).The Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) system is classified as part of the type II bacterial secretion mechanism, which is composed of two steps.Figure 1 - Promoter test circuits (more information about the design of the circuits here).We intended to evaluate the exportations systems through GFP fluorescence, since this phenomenon depends on the correct folding of the protein, which in this case is linked with the folding of Lcp and RoxA.strain 35Y.1 However, most of these organisms show a slow growth when using rubber as a sole carbon source.2-4\xa0\xa0\xa0To improve microbial rubber degradation efficiency, our project aims to create a gene circuit which will, among other things, be responsible for coding and expressing two enzymes: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase A) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein).TAs mentioned earlier, our enzymes have to be secreted so they can be in contact with the substrate, moreover it\x92s been seen that the heterologous expression of RoxA wasn\x92t successful due to inclusion body formation.The secretion is driven by three proteins of the cell envelope6.The first one is located in the outer membrane, and is called OMP (Outer Membrane Protein); the other two are cytoplasmic membrane proteins, called ABC (ATP-Binding Cassette) and MFP (Membrane Fusion Protein).However, the choice of the promoter system is not as simple as the chassis .The Gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli is the most used chassis in Synthetic Biology.This signal sequence recognizes the ABC protein and triggers the assembly of the whole complex for the translocation process.Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed induction, i.e., induced fluorescence per cell was (statistically) significantly higher than our negative controls.Since we had no issues at all with any of our constitutive promoters (see for instance our Interlab Study, Pveg characterization in E. Coli, Linker-GFP part), our primary concern is that our protocols should be modified and optimized for induced promoters.Finally, no considerable changes were detected in the RFP measures.In the x-axis, the higher the concentration label, the higher the concentration, with zero means no induction at all.That being said, we designed circuits to test the viability of three different inducible promoters: Plac, Para and Prha (figure 1).', 'safety': 'If they leave the bioreactor, sok won\x92t be produced, and the cell will die due to hok presence.For cells that didn\x92t inherited the developed DNA circuit: these will contain Hok in their plasma, but not sok - this is due to the difference in their degradation rates;

isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), the universal precursors to terpenoids like trans-zeatin.In order to produce trans-zeatin, we have inserted the Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 gene tzS and the Oryza sativa gene LOG into E. coli.While this composition is no longer suitable for frying, the DAGs, MAGs and FFAs leftover are high-energy molecules, making the spent oil an ideal feedstock.In order to further breakdown the TAGs, DAGs, and MAGs, we expressed an extracellular lipase from Bacillus stearothermophilus L1[9].When heated to high temperatures during the frying process, TAGs breakdown into diacylglycerols (DAGs), monoacylglycerols (MAGs), and free fatty acids (FFAs)[3]."The Mycobacterium tuberculosis very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase:

thereby increasing the metabolic flux through the entire pathway, increasing the utilization of frying oil waste.Hydroxylation of the N6-dimethylallyladenine produces biologically-active

the FFAs are in the cell, they undergo further breakdown by the endogenous beta-oxidation cycle.In order to make widespread use of our product feasible, we will create trans-zeatin using E.

vessel where extracellular breakdown could occur to create fatty acids and glycerol from triacyl-, diacyl-, and monoacylglycerols.A process flow diagram showing our required equipment and flow streams is below.Process Flow Diagram showing our proposed process for trans-zeatin production using frying oil wasteWe spoke to employees at the City of Fort Collins to discuss how our process would integrate into frying oil recycling in our community.Because zeatin can be used to increase plant biomass, it has potential applications in food, feed, and fuel.We tested strain growth in 100% frying oil (left) and 50% frying oil (right) solutions.Our team attempted to build a functional prototype of both the trans-zeatin production and frying oil breakdown steps of our process.We developed an experiment which grew our strain on frying oil waste (both at 100% and 50% concentrations) donated to us by a local restaurant, The Mayor of Old Town.The process we have designed is for the use of frying oil waste as a feedstock for E. coli which can use that energy to produce trans-zeatin.Next, the mixture would be fed into a continuously-stirred bioreactor containing our E. coli optimized for fatty acid breakdown and trans-zeatin production.Our use of frying oil waste as an alternative substrate for chemical production would not necessarily replace, but expand the amount of frying oil waste recycled instead of sent to landfills.Our process could allow for restaurants to break even or be paid for recycling their spent frying oil.Finally, the supernatant will be transferred to a column for solid phase extraction to create the final product.The results of this experiment showed that our lac promoter:fadD:fadL construct improved the cells\x92 ability to grow on actual frying oil waste.We were able to show a functional prototype of our frying oil digesting strain.Once biomass is sufficient, the cells would be harvested and lysed using sonication.Our proposed use of biological hosts to manufacture reagents is part of a larger movement in the synthetic biology community to work towards greener production.The production of cytokinins in bacterial hosts also offers an important alternative to the time- and cost-intensive process of extraction from plant tissues.Ideally, products would be transported outside of the cells.This vessel will need to be heated to 50-60 degrees Celsius for optimal activity of the lipase.', 'human_practice': 'Andrea Haight lets us in on all the challenges and rewards of industry, how to manage intellectual property concerns, and

consistently at higher ODs, but the lac promoter:fadD:fadL strain grew much better.Figure 4: Growth comparison of strains grown on 100% used frying oil solution.From the results, we can conclude that the presence of the genes does not increase metabolic stress on the cell.Figure 5: Growth comparison between a control strain and our trans-zeatin strain in shake flasks over 24 hours.Figure 6: Growth comparison between a control strain and our trans-zeatin strain in shake flasks over 72 hours.Figure 7: Growth comparison between a control strain and our trans-zeatin strain in bioreactors over 72 hours.Throughout these experiments, we also collected suspension samples which we purified and ran on a reverse-phase HPLC column.We found that combining the fadD and fadL resulted in the best growth rate by far.With the concept proven, we moved on to testing all of these constructs in real used frying oil.Both experimental strains were able to obtain increased cell growth compared to the control strain.The data that actually says more about the cells\x92 usage of the oil is the qualitative data.We suspected that it might have to do with our jerry-rigged dark room (cells got light exposure before we even had a chance to plate), or maybe we did not have high enough intensity light (so we tried exposing the plates to direct sunlight, the heat killed all our cells) or maybe our entire premise on how to measure the kill rate was off.To prevent unintended cell death, we kept our KillerRed strains in a jerry-rigged darkroom.We found that adding that just the fadD gave the cells no advantage over cells that had a similar metabolic load but did not produce fadD (the control - cells containing pSB1C3 with only the lac promoter).Our first issue was the strain of cells we were using did not have a strong lac repressor, therefore KillerRed was always being expressed.We then ran a very similar experiment as before on all of those constructs with the lac promoter plasmid as a control.However if trans-zeatin is better produced while the cells are in exponential growth the fadL by itself would be more ideal.The optimum point in the cells\x92 growth cycle for trans-zeatin growth would dictate which construct we would want to use.The data of the growth on 100% frying oil is less conclusive.The fadD +fadL cells likely as a whole reached stationary phase much sooner than the fadL cells.We concluded fadD addition was insufficient for increased fatty acid breakdown.Figure 2: Our second growth curve for the breakdown process.When no cells were added the water separated from the Brij 58:oil solution into very clear layers.Another observation that points to the cells using the fatty acids came from the 50% solution.Our results (shown in Figure 4) indicate at least an initial observation that the addition of these constructs is beneficial to cell growth.There is lots of room for error, including: getting a consistent volume of oil in the draw, spinning down the sample all the way to collect all the cells, and pulling off all the oil so only the cell weight is left.This made constructing a kill curve almost impossible, as we lost our control every time at the same rate we lost the cells that were supposed to be expressing KillerRed.Figure 1: First growth curve for the breakdown process.To determine if this is the issue, we will run qPCR to detect mRNA expression.We ran a lot of experiments to try and characterize the KillerRed part.Our team was able to successfully create two constructs, a basic part and a composite part which included an inducible promoter, which encode for the trans-zeatin biosynthesis pathway.The data we got from this experiment shows as little correlation as any of the previous ones we ran.The results from this experiment can be seen in Figures 3 and 4.From this data we can determine that when grown on 50% Frying, 50% Brij 58 solution both of our constructs reach greater cell density than our control.If trans-zeatin is best produced in stationary phase then fadD +fadL would be the better choice.The growth on 100% frying oil was quickly too much to measure using ODs so we switched to measuring cell weight.From this we conclude that the cells were doing something to alter the composition of the media.Growth comparison between lac promoter control, lac promoter:fadD, lac promoter:fadL, and lac promoter:fadD:fadL.This told us that the media was becoming more soluble in water, implying that the cells took up and used the insoluble fatty acids.Growth comparison between lac promoter control and lac promoter:fadD.We speculate that the E. coli may mutate the KillerRed gene so that the cells turn red but no reactive oxygen species are released to induce cell death.Ma, Zhen et al.Both the constructs do better than the control.It seems that the fadD + fadL does the best with fadL not far behind.The viscosity of the oil makes it very hard to work with.Alternatively, it is possible that the E. coli is not producing trans-zeatin at all.Instead of using steric acid, we grew the cells on 0.04% used frying oil.This is illustrated in Figure 1.Once we discovered that having just the fadD wasn\x92t enough we went back and did more research to see what else we could add to improve its performance.There is no noticeable difference in peaks between the controls and the test strains, and there are no noticeable peaks present at the time of the retention standard.There are two possible reasons for these results.To resolve this, we will use a more sensitive process, liquid chromatography with dual mass spectrophotometry, which can detect trans-zeatin presence in the pico- to nanogram per mL range.We found the the transport of fatty acids into the cell was another rate limiting step.Figure 3: Growth comparison of strains grown on 50% used frying oil solution.The first breakdown construct we made was just fadD under lac promoter control.The 50% oil: 50% Brij58 solution remained at low enough densities that we continued to measure growth using ODs.So we then constructed plasmids with just fadL and a promoter as well as one with both fadD, fadL, and a promoter.', 'safety': 'Standard safety measures such as long pants, gloves, goggles, and biosafety cabinets were used every day to protect both us and our organisms.Our lab work mostly involved chemicals typical to synthetic biology.For some of our experiments, we did have to take extra safety measures to protect ourselves.To test our breakdown constructs, we wanted to grow our E. coli in a media where the only carbon source was fatty acids.Before getting access to the lab every member had to be certified in BSL 1 safety procedures, hazardous waste creation and disposal, and undergo an orientation on the building we work in and the specific equipment in it.We were required to work with high concentrations of acetic acid, methanol, and formic acid during our extraction (SPE) and detection (HPLC).Fatty acids are very hydrophobic and suspending them into a media that cells can grow in requires surfactant (detergent).We used safety glasses, lab coats, and gloves in conjunction with a fume hood to ensure our safety.Out of concern for safety, we continued our search for a surfactant that had been proven to work in literature and had fewer hazards.This is a strongly corrosive detergent, and would require face shields to work with.Through our research we found that our use of a kill switch for cellular level bio containment was insufficient.In addition to using a laboratory strain of E. coli (DH5alpha) as our chassis we included a kill switch in our design.The trans-zeatin production construct makes a molecule that is beneficial to plants, and harmless to humans and bacteria.As a manufacturing track team, we wanted to create something that could be feasibly scaled up.We eventually found Brij 58, which is very safe to work with.For our work in extracting and identifying trans-zeatin, we also used extra caution.', 'keywords': 'constructed UMBC15project1 crystalline trans-zeatin angiostatin interdisciplinary specificity angiogenesis scientists

proof of concept.The last work package, proof of concept, will test our water collector with bacteria attached to it on its functionality.For the first time in history, the global demand for fresh water is overtaking its supply in many parts of the world.Having access to clean water is a fundamental human right.', 'design': 'As we can print our 3D shape in many different sizes, bottles of all sizes and shapes can be used as a water reservoir.As the biological function of the device can deteriorate over time, you will have to renew your dewpal from time to time, meaning we are still creating plastic waste.Overall, dewpal is comparable to the fog catchers in Peru, however, thanks to the INP that is attached via synthetic biology approaches, the atmospheric water capturing capabilities are expected to be higher when the dewpal collectors can be printed on full scale.The main reason that our dewpal is better than Watergen is because it needs no electricity.There is Watergen, a company that describes its vision as follows: \x93Water-gen\x92s vision is to provide humanity with an abundant, renewable source of fresh, clean drinking water, by extracting it directly from the air, our most abundant water resource.\x94 The products they develop, however, need electricity, which is not always and everywhere available in Third World Countries.A comparison in the quantity of water the dewpal water collector catches and price still need to be made.Also, as you can see in following simulation, the shape can be screwed on all sorts of water bottles so that the water can immediately be collected.Our project wants to design an optimized modular shape/surface for condensation and subsequent freshwater collection by gravity to solve the fact that in 2025, more than half of the countries in the world will be experiencing water shortage.Our dewpal device consists of a 3D printed shape with a screwcap so it can be attached to water bottles.This means that apart from the catchers, water tanks still need to be installed to provide the community with water in the months where no fog is formed.The U.N. predicts that by 2025, more than half of the countries in the world will be experiencing water stress or outright shortages.The biological functional half sphere of your dewpal can be disconnected from your screwcap bottom, meaning the screwcap bottom could have a nearly endless life time, while only the biologically functional part would need replacement from time to time.We tweaked this design so the air can enter our shape (see picture below), meaning we can collect more water than just the basic  full sphere  structure as it has a larger active surface area.As we already have the bacteria with INP attached, these only need to be cultured, which also shouldn t be too big of a cost.As for the water collection, we see our dewpal competing with the other projects once we get to full printing size.There is also need for piping to guide the water from the catchers to the water tanks.A pump is attached for easy access to the water.By building 5 fog catchers and planting over 1000 trees they were able to use water that was otherwise not used (from the fog), instead of water from the dwindling aquifers in Lima.A downside of the fogcatchers is that the presence of fog is an absolute must for the devices to collect water.This turbine directs air into the underground condensation chamber, where water is collected.Note that this design isn t implemented yet by our shape group, but will be in the future.The planted trees, by self-irrigating, help the restoration of the natural water cycle in the region.A major downside to the WaterSeer project is that a hole of two meters needs to be dug out to install the device.The former United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, states the  Lack of access to water for drinking, hygiene and food security inflicts enormous hardship on more than one billion members of the human family .As our project is developed for use in areas where water is scarce and these areas often coincide with developing and third world countries, electricity will not be freely available at any time.By doing this, our device has a positive impact on reducing plastic waste, as empty plastic bottles can now be used as a water reservoir, prolonging their life as such.It consists of a device that is planted at two meter under the ground, with a wind turbine head that sits above the ground.As millions of people are living in areas with water scarcity, our device could impact the life of all of them.Having access to fresh water is a fundamental human right.Being able to functionalize 3D printed shapes with biologicals has an ambundance of potential applications.There are already some potential solutions to water scarcity based on atmospheric water generation:There are fog catchers in Lima, Peru.No piping is needed as gravity makes the water flow through a series of collectors to a plastic bottle acting as a water reservoir.', 'human_practice': 'As we can print our 3D shape in many different sizes, bottles of all sizes and shapes can be used as a water reservoir.As the biological function of the device can deteriorate over time, you will have to renew your dewpal from time to time, meaning we are still creating plastic waste.As the purpose of our project was to contribute to a solution to the growing water shortage problem, we started delving into the literature, contacted experts in the various fields (3D printing, atmospheric water collection, ...) and had frequent brainstorm sessions with the team.We therefore definitely believe that we have the necessary ingredients (a cheap, small, easy to use & easy to stack device) in our dewpal recipe to become a game changer in the field of water collection.As the water gets collected, there will be a small risk that the attached bacteria will also find their way into the collected water as the bond between the biotin on the shape and the streptavidin on the bacteria is a very strong.As often done in practice, the vectors in our experiments are not self transducible, avoiding genetic material from being easily transferred.In one approach of our project we have attaching modified E. coli Top10 cells to our water collector.Throughout the course of the project we used his expertise as a guide for the designing and fine tuning of our model.The biological functional half sphere of your dewpal can be disconnected from your screwcap bottom, meaning the screwcap bottom could have a nearly endless life time, while only the biologically functional part would need replacement from time to time.Apart from providing easy and cheap access to clean drinking water, the sustainability and development of crops would also benefit enormously which in turn helps the economical situation in those countries.The benefits of the wide use of our dewpal device are huge.Note that this design isn t implemented yet by our shape group, but will be in the future.Our dewpal device consists of a 3D printed shape with a screwcap so it can be attached to water bottles.Around 1900 only 2% of the world population was under chronic water shortage while currently more than 1 billion people suffer from physical water scarcity and a quarter of the human population lack sufficient water due to economical reasons, such as the lack of infrastructure to take water from rivers and aquifers (Kummu et.It gave us the necessary determination to continue the work with true passion and dedication.Already from the beginning we had frequent conversations with Prof. Dan Fernandez, a leader in the field of atmospheric water collection.He shared his knowledge on 3D printing with us which led to significant improvements of the collector, more specifically on how the water is drained towards the centre of the shape.As the project went on, and after getting in touch with several humanitarian aid organisations (Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen, Protos, ... ), we had the growing believe that we could influence the lives of millions of people with the dewpal project.In the dewpal project, these strains are genetically engineered.Nevertheless, one should be aware of the public perception related to the use of GMOs for biotechnological applications, although it is in general less problematic compared to GMO plants or animals.All experiments were carried out in a contained laboratory environment (GMO-class 2 laboratory).Bacteria often have the capability of transferring genetic material, especially when self-transmissible vectors are used.We soon realized that the water scarcity problem is bigger than previously thought and generally assumed.Additionally, the device can be produced locally, if 3D-printers and filament are available or can be provided, reducing environmental and economic costs.By doing this, our device has a positive impact on reducing plastic waste, as empty plastic bottles can now be used as a water reservoir, prolonging their life as such.The cells themselves will not be used in applications, but only the cell-free bio-molecules they produce.The first could be to add a killing switch to the bacteria, or make the E. coli auxotrophic.This is exactly what we did with the Dewpal project: our shape is printed in cheap but sturdy materials resulting in low production costs, especially in mass production.This brings along no additional risk as the engineered strains are merely used as \x91cell factories\x91 in an enclosed environment.Additionally, in regions of physical water scarcity the average income per capita is rather low which hinders the development of infrastructures to collect freshwater (for example by filtering seawater) (see following picture).To improve the life quality of those billions of people, it is essential to create a cheap and efficient device to passively collect freshwater.During our project we also developed a new type of 3D printing material, but in order to make this into a useable filament, we needed a filament extruder.Furthermore, the environment will not be exposed to these modified organisms thanks to contained use and standard GLP.Also, since consuming polluted water and consequent diseases are a major hindrance in education, having access to sufficient clean drinking water will improve the level of education in those areas.Water scarcity is a major and growing problem worldwide.', 'modeling': 'This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or

the space environment, we need to search for the new ideas instand of just simply \x93add or subtract" biomass.It is developing the entire circulation system design from the bottom and making full use of the advanced functions among different species, avoiding weaknesses, ultimately achieving material circulation and life support efficiently without any pollution."[10] \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0From 1960s, several major advanced countries and organizations tried to build a enclosed environment by the Earth s biological regeneration of life support system to simulate material recycling process in space environment.Since 1989, the European Space Agency (ESA) has cooperated with several agencies to launch the MELiSSA, a microecological life support system research program.The ultimate goal is to include multiple compartments to achieve complete closure of the water and gas cycles.we can\x92t just simply "add or subtract" biomass but search for the new ideas,develop the entire circulation system design from the bottom and make full use of the advanced functions among different species, avoid weaknesses, ultimately achieve material circulation and life support efficiently without any pollution.Even the most advanced life support system, the International Space Station (ISS), can only work as a partial closed-loop system, circulating oxygen and controlling pressure.Furthermore, scientists have been neglected the role of microbes in the overall simulation system until they found the important effects of microbes in the entire simulated closed ecosystemlater.Finally, the efficiency of energy utilization and material recycling in natural ecosystems is too low,which requires a large number of ecological space in order to satisfy the astronauts  living requirements (average 100 square meters per person).And the whole story of survival reflects the core idea of the astronauts life support system - recycling everything that can be recycled.Astronauts material consumption reaches 11 tons / year, while the spacecraft to transport 1kg of goods will cost $ 10,000.If Human wants to fly out of the earth like the interstellar travel in science fictions, the primary task is to maintain a reliable system of life support.To solve the complex problems of long-term space travels such as material cycling and life sustainment relying on the existing biological resources of the earth s ecology,we face the challenges including the cost,volume, flexibility and availability.[11] \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the 1970s,the former Soviet Union successfully constructed BIOS-3 enclosed material circulation system, which could achieve 100% of the water cycle and gas circulation.The whole system was completely isolated from the outside air and water, but the system failed to achieve the basic material quality balance, and ultimately failed.For the past half a century of human exploring space, the entire system is basically non-renewable, So it is called Open Loop System.Astronauts can easily obtain a variety of supplies, including food, water and oxygen generators, and achieve the circulation of the waste.It is only performing short-term tasks or in orbit on the International Space Station.Because the biological platform has a self-replicating function and the flexibility biology, there has been a very marginal and mysterious branch, Space Synbio.Space biosynthetic biology will be a catalyst for the development of synthetic biology and the aerospace industry.In 1986, Edward Bass from the USA established a private laboratory, "Biosphere 2", to see whether it can create a completely closed life-support system, and all the lives in system live in harmony.Manned space flight only reached the moon from the time when the first human rocket was launched.At present, space exploration continues to expand, from near-Earth orbit to deep space exploration, from landing the moon to Mars survival which may come true in the future.However, due to the neglect of themicroorganisms,which isa very important loop in the system,the closed experiment only lasted for two weeks in such system.The platform of synthetic biology ensures that the search process is more reliable.[7] In this process, it is difficult to bring all the air, food and water needed.From 1968 the release of "2001 space roaming", so far, most of the ideas in the film have been realized, except for the space roaming.Artificial simulation is difficult to achieve.The second is that the stability of the natural ecosystem is based on the huge biomass,but the one of the small-scale simulation system is frail.Designing the travel plans to go to the moon and Mars or even further place is very different.He used human excrement, Mars soil and the water from rocket explosion to grow potatoes.University of California, Berkeley, Adam P. Arkin summed up six major challenges of the space The challenge can give people the power to innovate and inspire imagination.Over the past 20 years, we have cut down over 130 million hectares of forest, but only get 47.5 million hectares of arable lands [2].Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project[J].In the film, Mark lived in the desolate Mars, making the environment in cabin similar with the Earth.Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 2015, 12(113).ARC (Ames Research Center) defines space synthesis biology as a subject that provides reliable biological tools and techniques to sustain human activities in space, reduces the risk of space exploration, and drives some hypothesis-driven research.The six grand challenges of space synthetic biology (art by Hugo Teixeira).At the end of last year, the film" The Martian" vividly presents the future scene that astronauts will face.However, the natural ecosystem evolution is the result of million-years evolution.The interaction among different organisms is very complex.Then humans can survive.A famous line from the movie:"I gotta science the shit out of this planet.[9] \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Facing the closed system of spacecraft, how to maximize the utilization of material and energy recycling in order to maintain the long-term space activities for astronauts has became an unavoidable and insurmountable problem for scientists.', 'description': 'We hope to use E.coli to realize the re-use of carbon dioxide metabolized by astronauts, like green leaf, and to synthesize Glycogen which can be reused by astronauts,using formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.This is the part that connects the front and the back of the entire Blue Leaf project, and also determines whether the entire device can be used to synthesize starch with a carbon compound as the sole carbon source.The route cannot synthesize Glycogen with only one carbon compound as the sole carbon source, and is not suitable for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.In the first part, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.The device,which can maintain the carbon cycle in the long-term spacecraft,is what we call the Blue Leaf.This year, we focus on the issue of carbon cycling in spaceships during long-term space travel.Our wet experiments also also focused on the validation of this pathway and the efficient expression as well as the catalysis of both enzymes.Figue4, Part II, New Synthesis of D-xylulose by Formaldehyde Assimilation \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the third part, Glycogen Metabolism can be used to synthsize D-xylulose into Glycogen.The use of mature carbon dioxide fixation technology turns the carbon dioxide in the air into formic acid[3], and then gets formaldehyde which is the sole carbon source by specific enzyme.[5] \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In addition, in order to enhance the efficiency of the combined catalysis, we used synthetic protein scaffolds technology[6].The second part is the new formaldehyde condensation pathway which can achieve the efficient synthesis of D-xylulose from formaldehyde.[1] \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Last year, the iGEM team AACHEN2015 used E.coli to design a pathway for Glycogen by methanol.However, the five carbon compound needs to be obtained by E. coli from other glycolytic pathways.Though they aimed at using methanol to form glycogen, in fact,they overlooked one of the most important aspects![4]Figue3, Part I, Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide.[2]They used electric conversion to get methanol,which is the raw material.From the 1960s, the former Soviet Union, the United States, the European Union and other space organizations have tried to construct bio-regenerating life-support system under earth  s closed environment in order to simulate the material recycling process in space environment.The former can turn formaldehyde condensation into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and hydroxyacetaldehyde.The latter condenses two intermediate products into a five carbon sugars Compounds: D-xylulose.This year, we have designed a new carbon cycle system.In other words, E. coli must consume at least one molecule of six carbon sugar to synthesize a glycogen hexose sugar monomer."Rapid Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by an Iridium Pincer Catalyst Immobilized on Carbon Nanotube Electrodes."We have optimized the protein scaffold sequence and performed functional validation on the basis of the iGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team.For a closed system such as a spacecraft, how to maximize the recycling efficiency of material and energy in order to maintain the astronauts\x92 long-term space activities has become an inescapable but difficult problem for scientists to overcome.', 'design': 'But this idea about utilizing the Methanol Condensation Cycle and Glycogen Metabolism into the synthesis of glycogen has stimulated us greatly.To synthesize Glycogen in the presence of one-carbon compound as the sole carbon source, we need to find or even design a new pathway for the synthesis of five carbon saccharide from formaldehyde.A simple and effective method for the complex reaction involved with so many enzymes should be found to enhance the interaction and cooperation within each enzyme and improve the efficiency of the overall reaction.The toxicity of the formaldehyde is high and unstable, especially for the cells.The synthesis of glycogen was achieved by using the synthetic route of formaldehyde to D-xylulose, the partial methanol assimilation pathway and glycogen metabolic pathway.Figue 6, Formic acid to formaldehyde conversion pathway.[4] \xa0\xa0\xa0We improved the scaffold protein on the basis of the IGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team[5] and used it in our designed pathway-from formaldehyde to D-xylulose.Thus, based on the ways to fix the carbon dioxide by electro-transformation, a one-carbon product with low toxicity and high electro-conversion efficiency should be found, and then we design the pathway of it to assimilate.Though this new approach, we have achieved the synthesis of D-xylulose by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.It is beneficial for the synthesis of carbohydrates to use formic acid as carbon source.However, in this synthetic pathway, an obvious defect lies on the additional requirement of a five-carbon sugar used together with methanol and then to form glycogen.This route aforementioned cannot be used to synthesize Glycogen only with one carbon compound as the carbon source, so as to be deficient for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.Besides, we applied this part in our scaffold protein(BBa_K2155012) with other cohesins, and proved it was functional.Figue 4, CO2 Reduction Thermodynamics & The Strategy of Hydrogenation of CO2 to Formic Acid.This part is \x93Bearing before and after\x94 part in Blue Leaf as well as the determined factor of whether the entire device can achieve the synthesis of starch by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.In order to improve the efficiency of the multi-enzyme reaction system, Self-assembly Protein Scaffold was used.It transforms methanol into formaldehyde that will be condensed into six-carbon sugar with five-carbon sugar produced in E. coli, and then goes to the subsequent glycogen polymerization.Since the photosynthesis efficiency of plant is only about 1%[1] , it is clearly not a practical way to use the green leaves to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft where the space is narrow while the demand for energy is huge.The scaffold protein consists of the following components:Figue 3, Synthetic protein scaffolds improve the efficiency of multi - enzyme reaction.Last year, the iGEM team from Aachen University of Technology in Germany[2] designed a synthetic pathway for Glycogen with the methanol from E.coli and finally won the Best manufacture prize.The system, in other words, will convert carbon dioxide into the sugar compounds offering heat supply, so as to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft and ensure the astronauts  long-term space travel or space presence.Based on a registered cohesin(BBa_K1830004) submitted byiGEM15_Concordia\x92s, we isolated the cohesin module of this part from the linker, which makes following team could adjust linker\x92s length according to their requirement when they use this cohesin.In the next route, we used Methanol Condensation Cycle.Design a system to achieve the re-use of carbon dioxide in the spacecraft.D-xylulose was phosphorylated to 5-phosphate-xylulose and then went into the methanol assimilation pathway.We found two enzymes with different condensation functions, BFD and TalB , the former could condense formaldehyde into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and Glycolaldehyde.In this way, the target protein could be anchored firmly to the scaffold.Therefore, the linker\x92s length is a main influence of multi-enzyme system\x92s reaction efficiency.Amazingly, the conversion efficiency could be more than 80%.Cohesins were expressed on the scaffold, while Dockerins co-expressed with the target enzyme to form a fusion protein.Microscopically, it could automatically assemble the fusion protein with the corresponding Dockerin, making different enzymes next to each other.We know that complex enzyme reaction often has a problem that the products of the last enzyme cannot be timely and competely transported to the next enzyme, making the overall reaction efficiency low due to the location of different enzymes in the space far apart.There are few pathways of formic acid assimilation in nature, and we have searched through the literature to find a path that has been validated.In the case of Blue Leaf, a system in which multiple enzymes catalyze the reaction, the efficiency of the coordinated reaction between the enzymes determines the efficiency of the overall catalytic reaction.Cohesins and Dockerins were the major components of protein scaffolds, each with a reactive group that recognizes each other and mosaics.They got the methanol,which is the raw material, through the electric conversion.[8] Moreover, the toxicity of formate is much lower than that of methanol.So our experiments also focused on the validation of this pathway and the efficient expression and the efficient catalysis of both enzymes.From the macroscopic point of view, it can improve the local enzyme concentration and substrate concentration, thereby enhancing the multi-enzyme reaction system.\x93Computational Protein Design Enables a Novel One-Carbon Assimilation Pathway.\x94 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 112(12): 3704\x969.It is clear that formic acid is more suitable as a sustainable carbon source than methanol.[9]Figue 5, Investigator Peng Kang, from TIPC of CAS, designed a electrical device which can transform carbon dioxide into Formaldehyde.', 'human_practice': 'And we went to the laboratory to study the related mature theories and the first time for us to participate in this competition, the students around and

to convert methanol to D-xylulose in vitro, herein, we would like to look at its possibility in vitro by using stoichiometric In a short word, a stoichiometric model is a combination of reactions related to target molecules which form a metabolic network that could offer bird view of For this work, we built up the model based on present model of E.coli from CellNetAnalyzer(Steffen and J 2007), and added our reactions into it.Besides, the production of D-xylulose was increased because of supplement of other reactions.Figure 1 The stoichiometric model of genetic modified E.coli.Later, the

'modeling': 'We decided to treat the blood and bones of a contaminated person as two different systems to more accurately model how the body metabolizes lead and processes it.Unfortunately, this means that the child will continue to have prolonged exposure to lead at a very low level.With all the important information put into the model, we were able to begin simulating lead exposure.To examine the effect of severity of exposure over the same period of time, we ran simulations of a 100 day exposure to different levels of contamination range including 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppb.The results of these simulations are below It s clear that while the blood lead levels spike quickly, the body is able to filter the lead out of its system within 3 or 4 months after the initial exposure.This model provides a quantified approach relating the level and duration of lead exposure with the concentration of lead in the blood.You should note that as the duration of exposure increases, so does the variation in blood lead level, meaning that the severity for the same level of contamination will be more of a range than one distinct value.The Effect of Lead Contamination in Drinking Water on a Young Population  In developing a lead sensor for our project, we were curious about the effects of lead contamination in the water supply on small children.We were pretty appalled by the devastating effects lead can have on the human body and how long it can persist even after the initial exposure.Whether it is in estimating the severity of the events in Flint, Michigan or in detecting the threshold of exposure without noticeable side effects, this model could be the first step in better realizing how our bodies take up, store and slowly get rid of lead.With these literature values, we were able to create a rudimentary mass balance of the human body focusing on the amount of lead ingested and the amount that is excreted.The results of these simulations are shown below  Here we can see that even though the increase in lead in the bones is linear with time, the concentration of lead in the blood appears to begin reaching a saturation point.We began with a thorough examination of the literature, looking for important details on how much lead is absorbed into the body, where the absorbed lead goes, and how long it stays in the body.To account for the different amounts of water a child may drink in a given day, we ran the simulation 50 times and plotted them all on the same graph.Blood-lead levels do reach different levels of saturation but now we see that the rate at which lead is absorbed by the bones increases with contamination severity.Initially, we used a pulse of lead contamination of 50 ppb for 10 days on a 1-year-old child.This gave us a range of possible blood lead level concentrations based off of the level of lead contamination as we will see later.Determining the blood volume was a little tricky.We decided to look at the same level of exposure (50 ppb) but for increasing intervals of time (ranging from the initial 10 days and increasing to 25, 50 and 100 days of exposure.To get a better look at just the blood concentrations, below is a zoomed-in portion of the same graph just focussing on blood-lead levels for the first 200 days.As of yet there is no hard evidence that proves such a long exposure to lead at a low level can do any damage, there is a growing notion that an exposure like this at such a young age can make the individual at higher risk for depression and other neurological conditions.This is not true for the bones because the lead that makes it into the bones stays around much longer.We were able to find the average water consumed by a child based on their age in order to get an idea of their lead intake.This was meant to simulate a brief exposure to a mild amount of lead.We decided to model it using a 500 day window to see the long-term effects of lead exposure.', 'notebook': 'For a list of our protocols, visit the

versus Duplex experiment above, the duplex and folded hairpin do not activate the toehold switch because the trigger is hybridized to the catalytic strand.Results from sequencing in Week 11 suggest that our completed construct contains CFP instead of amilCP, although the construct contains both the pT7-RBS and terminator.The final concentration of DNAzyme in the reactions is 3.74 nM, and the final concentration of lead is 2 µM.As shown below with data from Week 5, the plasmid triggers activate the toehold switch with as little as 10 ng of plasmid in a 25-?L reaction.However, a comparison by concentration of DNA instead of mass would be more accurate because the plasmid has much more "extra" DNA than the linear form.In Week 6, we ran cell-free reactions over a range of volumes.However, the duplex did not activate the toehold switch.We started working with the lead hairpin DNAzyme in Week 13.In Week 6, we found that the DNA trigger also activated the toehold switch at concentrations as low as 1 pM.In cell-free extract, the lead hairpin DNAzyme produces higher activation of the toehold switch than the duplex DNAzyme in a 1:1000 ratio.Below, the LacZ expression produced by the toehold switch activated by the hairpin DNAzyme cleavage product is compared to the LacZ expression in a system without lead.This could be a result of the excess catalytic strand interfering with the other processes occurring in the reaction.Although the dPAGE assays we performed in Weeks 7 to 10 do not provide clear information, the cell-free reactions suggest that the DNAzyme does cleave its substrate.Since we do not have a LacZ we can use, we have not started construction of this second part of the amplifier.The time course data shown below is more a function of evaporation than reaction progress; the liquid evaporated over the course of the run.We analyzed the efficiency of sequestration in Week 11.As shown in the figure below, there was still a signal with a reaction volume of 5 ?L.In addition, the triggers are switch-specific--the trigger for the D switch does not activate the G switch.However, after leaving them in the incubator overnight, the reactions darkened in color.For more details about our daily activities and experiments, visit our Notebook.In Week 8, we found that linear DNA does not perform better than plasmid DNA in PURExpress.The gel below suggests that all of the substrate strand is sequestered, but the thickness of the catalytic strand s band as the ratio increases could be blocking the signal from the substrate strand.After six hours of

acid has to bind to tRNA.The amino-acyl-tRNA bond formation active site should be sterically altered to select for CBZ-leucine, and the editing site should also be changed so that it recognizes wild-type-leucyl-tRNA as an incorrect pairing.To implement this system completely, the genes for both the CBZ cleavage enzyme and for the mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase need to be readily transcribed

a non-natural metabolite that is not typically readily available in the environment.Without the necessary metabolite needed to fuel our modified system, the cell is prevented from continuing

'human_practice': 'Working with the head of the Open Bio Labs, we created a biosafety guidelines document, including provisions on biocontainment.Not only did we work to improve awareness of and dialogue about biocontainment in the general public, but we also considered the iGEM community as another target audience.In response to these discussions, our team generated a sample policy proposal for the testing, application, monitoring, and termination of biocontainment devices in a released GEO.In the development of our method, we conducted interviews not only with synthetic biology experts, but also with individuals working in various industries that use microbes or genetically engineered organisms (GEOs).Feedback on our proposed biocontainment method from synthetic biology experts allowed us to reassess our project design, our definition of success, and how we would demonstrate that success.The results of this survey and our conversations with scientific and ethical experts informed the creation of a biocontainment pamphlet for the use of future iGEM teams.Despite the rapid growth of the field, several applications face barriers to implementation, including the lack of an effective, cheap, and easy-to-use biocontainment method.In addition to educating other teams about biocontainment, these conversations allowed us to gauge the current knowledge and concerns of the iGEM community.With industry experts, we discussed the potential for application of our biocontainment method in their companies or industries.As the field of synthetic biology moves out of its infancy, molecular biologists, community biology laboratories, and iGEM teams around the globe are making revolutionary discoveries with more frequency and greater impact.In July, our team facilitated a forum discussion about biocontainment at the University of Maryland\x92s Mini-Jamboree event.At this event, we designed our own module and accompanying video to teach children and their parents about the purpose of biocontainment.We also created a widget that teams can utilize to determine the best biocontainment method for their project, depending on their specific concerns and implementation goals.To further improve public awareness on synthetic biology and biocontainment, we created two videos on these topics.Oftentimes, individuals working in relevant industries were very knowledgeable about the biological concerns raised by our methods and offered insight on the design or testing of our method.Additionally, we spoke to the main regulatory agencies of GEOs in the US about their current policies.However, while speaking to these experts, it was clear that lack of an acceptable biocontainment method was not the only barrier preventing implementation.', 'modeling': 'The following is a visualization of our mutant synthetase with optimal structure.Upon initiation, MUT asks for four main inputs: the protein pdb file that will be analysed, the residues that the program will mutate, the coordinates of the binding pocket for docking simulations, and a ligand pdb file.To perform mutagenesis on leucyl-tRNA synthetase, an integrated software script was written in the Linux shell, with inputs including a protein to mutate, a ligand, a list of residues of interest, and binding pocket location.Using a variety of protein-ligand docking software like CSM-lig, Autodock Vina and iGEMDOCK, we were able to confirm that AMS (the adenylating agent found in the literature) and AMP yield similar binding affinities to the synthetase when bound with leucine.Lastly, we performed Michaelis-Menten modeling for the enzyme pepsin to gauge activity in nonspecific cleavage enzymes.The leucine tRNA Synthetase (LeuS) used in the following simulations was found using the RCSB Protein Data Bank.After mutagenesis is complete files undergo stability testing and docking to determine if the new mutant is stable and a better match for the ligand.To select a protecting group, the team used protein-ligand docking software to compare binding affinities of several protected leucine/synthetase complexes.Should the results look bad, mutants from a lower ranking can be selected or new residues can be picked.Virginia iGEM designed a Linux-based protein engineering tool called MUT.MUT first performs stability testing and docking to get baseline values for the future tests before it mutates the initial PDB file.However, the binding affinities for all the protecting group choices were very similar, so we chose based on a different set of criteria.Another 4 data runs were performed and can be found in the supplementary data section, but exhibit similar results.Several programs were used to asses the viability of the different protecting groups in our system.Biochemistry 46, 4466\x964472.To find residues of interest in the catalytic pocket, we used a combination of docking data as simulated in iGEMDOCK and of structural data visualized in Ligplot to determine additional mutational focci.The following is a PyMol visualization of the protein that we compiled.As stated in its documentation, during the characterization of 4aq7, a leucyl-adenylate analogue was used to determine the crystal structure of the protein.Energistic relationships between molecules of 4aq7 are shown in detail in the 2D representation, and conformational analysis can be conducted on the 3D image.The following residues were picked for mutagenesis.Residues that returned large values in the protected leucine simulations were believed to have a high impact on the reduced viability of docking.Once an initial ranking has be completed, the user has the option to rerun docking on the selected mutants to confirm the simulation.The user inputs to MUT a protein\x92s PDB file, residues of interest for mutation, a binding pocket, and a ligand.The editing site mutation, Thr 252, allows for the hydrolysis of Leu-tRNA, a crucial step in our overall project.22Reference:Mursinna, R.S., Lee, K.W., Briggs, J.M., and Martinis, S.A. (2004).This program was used to query for the optimal mutant structure for Cbz-Leu docking.Residues that protruded around the N terminus of leucine, the location the protecting group binds to, were thought to be possible sources of steric hindrance.Three programs are used to accomplish this task: PyRosetta conducts computational mutagenesis, FoldX tests protein stability, and AutoDock Vina performs protein-ligand docking.Of the four mutations, one is in the editing site while the other three are in miscellaneous locations around the protein.After the simulation runs, the program outputs a top ten list of mutant structures along with their files.In order to determine the relative efficiency of our enzyme, we modeled another BioBrick.These are detailed in the following figure.Pugh chart used to score and rank possible protecting groups.First, the residue had to have been shown to have a high energy during docking.Some of the criteria are practical like the cost of the protecting group and enzyme.After the reductionist approach is complete, all files are mutated to four mutants and re-scored.We modeled our system in silico to select a sterically feasible protecting group and to optimize a mutant leucyl-tRNA synthetase for complementarity of its catalytic site to protected leucine, and of its editing site to leucine.MUT utilizes PyRosetta, Autodock Vina, and FoldX to mutate, test, and rank protein structures based on docking scores.MUT generates mutant structures, subjects the resultant proteins to stability testing, and ranks the results based on protein-ligand docking data.Ligplot is capable of creating a 2D image of the binding site as detailed in the crystolography file.Files that fail the tests go to the kennels.BBa_M1436 codes for pepsinogen, an inactive form of the cleavage enzyme pepsin.This program is used to screen protein-ligand docking across possible protein mutants.The first and fastest way is the reductionist approach.Below is a flowchart that explains the algorithm of the program.The kennel system allows for two levels of simulation.The script runs mutagenesis, assesses mutant protein stability, then performs ligand docking.This method ensures that all possible combinations of mutations is tested, but is computationally intense.After a run is complete, all files are automatically ranked and ordered by binding values (more negative is better).Thus, 4aq7 represents an protein that can accurately model our system containing leucyl-AMP and LeuS.The above figure shows select data from CSM-lig comparing Cbz-leu-AMS (Left) and Cbz-leu-AMP (Right).By analyzing the file contents in PDBest, a PDB editor software, we identified the analogue as leucyl-AMS.We constructed six different molecules with ChemSketch in order to determine whether the analogue significantly altered the conformation of LeuS.', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'resistance

are very important in cheese making, the most critical step is the addition of enzymes and bacteria, specifically rennet and lactic acid bacteria, respectively.More importantly, the bacteria are used to ferment the milk by lowering the pH, which ultimately aids in the creation of a product that can actually be cut and molded into what we call cheese.Many different techniques are used to control phage infection, including prevention of phage contamination by routine cleaning of the fermentation areas and rotation of cultures, employment of phage resistant strains of bacteria, and efforts to minimize opportunities for the appearance of new strains of phage.Once all of the unwanted solids have been filtered out of the milk, the milk is placed in troughs where enzymes and bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, are added to create flavor and texture.In the version where the bacteria are able to fight against the infection, a kill switch will cause the bacteria to lyse before the phage is able to fully form, preventing further damage to the culture.In addition, another goal for the USU team is to test the viability of promoters and fluorescent proteins that were designed for lactic acid bacteria in L. lactis.With the rise of molecular biotechnology, it is possible to create new types of phage resistant bacteria.These bacteria will work by using a promoter from the virus itself which will activate when the phage is present.The dairy industry has funded research of this sort to creating phage resistant strains of lactic acid bacteria.The 2015 Utah State University iGEM team is using synthetic biology to create a strain of Lactococcus lactis that is capable of detecting, reporting, and fighting against phage infection, specifically the bacteriophage P335 from the Siphoviridae family.A GFP or RFP that is functional in the L. lactis bacteria will report the presence of phage so that actions can be taken to counteract virus propagation.As said previously, these organisms provide the different textures and flavors to the cheese.At this point, the milk starts to curdle and the curds and whey become differentiated.One notable example is the fermentation of dairy products in order to create cheese and yogurt.Because cheese makers are only interested in the curds, the whey is separated from the curds.Cheese would be very bland if salt was not in the process; therefore, after separation, the curds are milled, where they are broken up into smaller pieces and then salted.', 'design': 'In this system, transcription and subsequent expression of the fluorescent reporter proteins would only be initiated during ?31 phage infection of L. lactis, from the designed construct within the cell, and allow for qualitative and quantitative detection by observing and measuring fluorescence, respectively.This system is designed to provide an effective defense against ?31 infection of L. lactis industrial dairy fermentations that results in cell death of infected cells and prevents propagation of the ?31 phage, allowing Additionally, this experiment was designed purposefully incorporating the divergent p2001 promoter because of its conservation and high sequence similarity with the other lytic members of the lactococcal P335 species phage.Our designed experiment investigates the use of two ?31 promoters, a divergent promoter (p2001) located within the genetic switch region of the phage genome and a middle promoter (p1997), for detection and a triggered defense system.Making them excellent candidates for use in a detection and defense

RFP), inserted within the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) expression vector pTRKH2.With the assumption that expression can potentially be induced from this promoter by other lytic members, allowing for broader detection and defense against one of the main phage species that infect and ruin Fluorescent detection of ?31: Upon injection of the ?31 chromosome expression from the p2001 rightward promoter or the p1997 promoter is activated in our designed construct, resulting in production of green fluorescent protein.Triggered defense of ?31: Upon injection of the ?31 chromosome expression from the p2001 rightward promoter or the p1997 promoter is activated in our designed construct, resulting in expression of the three-gene restriction cassette lalR.This detection system provides a rapid detection method that could be implemented within dairy fermentation facilities, allowing for timely monitoring The ?31 phage triggered defense system was designed using the same promoter concept, but with expression of lalR, a three-gene restriction cassette (depicted as a single gene and enzyme for simplicity), after initial phage infection.', 'human_practice': 'It is of particular importance to our project as it deals with the dairy industry which does allow for the use of microbes in food production but has yet to allow their genetic modification.To date, no genetically engineered starter cultures have been approved for use in the USA by the FDA, and specific criteria for approval has yet to be established [2, 3].USU Video ChallengeElementary, Middle School, and High School Students from the 4 corners area of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico were able learn about iGEM as part of the STEAM Expo, at Utah State University\x92s Blanding Campus.Research and the accomplishments of former USU iGEM teams were the main attractions, and the scope of the iGEM competition was used to explain the wide development of genetic engineering at high school and undergraduate levels.This event is hosted annually, and is a boon to inspiring young minds to pursue higher education.Because the promoters and all subsequent genetic elements incorporated within this project are of lactococcal origin, it is a reasonable assumption that they should rationally meet the requirements of being considered GRAS, making this a promising model for P335 lytic phage detection and defense in future approved genetically engineered starter cultures [4].Because of the countless foreseeable benefits using genetically engineered starter cultures and the amount of increased potential profits in industrial cheese production, scientist continue research into the area and remain optimistic for future approval [3].Although the world seems to be headed in the direction of accepting genetic engineering, it is apparent that it will be a process that will take many years, continued research on both the potential benefits and safety of the technology, and the development of regulations to help guide its use.But it became clear that having each of these components separately constructed would give us the ability to independently test them and determine if one was a more efficient solution than simply combining them.Equipped with our outreach video, we now have a tool to help engage the public and discuss how genetically modified organisms have the ability to impact and enrich their lives in a positive manner.Those involved in it have the responsibility to ensure that their decisions consider not just the economic benefit of a potential solution but also the moral implications and the health and environmental impact that could arise.The debate on whether this technology can be implemented safely rages especially fiercely in the realm of food production.The technology is a two-edged sword with the ability to save and improve many lives or to place the lives of many into danger, perhaps irreversibly.Attendees traveled hours, some driving by bus from their reservation, and over one thousand participants gathered at the USU Blanding Campus for the two day Expo.Carl specifically noted stages of the process where phage infection becomes a concern, which is where the iGEM project should come in handy: preventing phage from ruining a batch of cheese.After the information session Carl also gave a tour of the facilities and explained the different machines used in the factory.After speaking with industry, the team met together to discuss how this new insight might impact our original set of goals.Carl is very familiar with methods and techniques of the production of cheese.One such standard is the GRAS standard which stands for generally regarded as safe.Building upon previous endeavors such as The Flame Challenge with Alan Alda and the news website Reddit\x92s ELI5 (Explain Like I\x92m 5) page, we proposed to solicit other iGEM teams in order to develop videos to explain synthetic biology at its most basic level.The USU iGEM team met with Carl Brotherson, Associate Director of the Western Dairy center to learn more about the cheese-making process.Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a status given by the USDA for allowable food additives.During the meeting Carl explained different types of bacteria used and various methods of creating different types of cheese.A large portion of these students were Native American, exploring their options and interests in the many disciplines of higher education.At this booth, the main topic presented was the application of synthetic biology.From this effort we hope to excite professionals in other scientific fields who can initiate their own informal competitions to open up the black boxes of their field of work and make this knowledge freely available to the public, especially our youth.doi: 10.1016/S0168-1605(02)00238-6Soccol CR, Pandey A, Larroche C (2013) Fermentation Processes Engineering in the Food Industry.18 September 2015.

engineered strain of L. lactis that integrated our fluorescent response with an autolysis cassette, both induced by proteins native to the ?31 bacteriophage.Breaking down the language barriers between synthetic biologists and the public is the first step in allowing a meaningful conversation about our scientific discipline.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': 'Ensure centrifuge is

longerTake 1 mL of overnight L. lactis culture and add 500 µL to two sterile, labeled 1.5 mL bullet tube.Our lab normally uses the CTAB DNA extraction method, however this method does not work with L. lactis, therefore we have to use the Qiagen alkaline lysis kit.Grow up 5 mL culture overnight in LB (6 mL if you want glycerol stock \x96 1 mL will be used for the frozen stock, which should be removed before pelleting the cells in the next step)Mix by inverting the tube by hand 10-20 times.Cryoprotectants are non-toxic to the cells, and are generally able to pass through the membranes into the cells.Take 1 mL of overnight E. coli culture and add it to a clean, labeled 1.5 mL tube.Add 200 µL of 80% glycerol to the tube (this creates a roughly 15% glycerol solution).Mix well by inverting the tubes (unmixed glycerol will tend to stay separate from the cell solution.Immediately place the cells into a -80 °C freezer box.Plate out 1 plate of bacteria for each of the fluorescent protein constructs as well as one plate with a standard fluorescent protein construct as a positive control and one plate with non-transformed competent cells as a negative controlIdeally, there should be one positive control for each fluorescent protein used in the constructs being examined16-18 hours after plating the bacteria, pick 3 colonies for each construct and place each picked colony in 5 mL of LB media in a 15 mL culture tube with the appropriate antibioticsAllow these cultures to grow for 14-16 hours in an incubator at 220 rpm and 37 °CInoculate one 25 mL culture of LB media at 0.1 OD600 from each of the 5 mL culturesAllow the 25 mL cultures to grow to an OD600 of 0.5 in an incubator at 220 rpm and 37 °C, checking the OD approximately every 0.5 hoursWhen each culture reaches an OD600 of 0.5, place it inside the 4°C refrigerator to slow cell growth so that the cultures will be processed at similar phases of growthPlace 3 mL of each culture in 15 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuge for 15 min at 3500 rpmDiscard supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 3 mL of 0.15 M NaCl solutionPlace 200 µL of each culture in three individual wells of a 96-well plate (triplicates of 200 µL samples).Pipette up and down a few times to mix.Remove the solution to just above the two plates in the first removal pipetting (~1/2 of the volume) and transfer it to the original cell tube (NOT THE DNA TUBE).Add 1 µL of Ethidium bromide for EACH 10 mL of gel volume (5 µL for small gel, 20 µL for large gel).The gel solution can be allowed to cool slightly before pouring into the gel box (pouring boiling solution into gel box can cause it to warp and bend over time).Gently pour the gel into the gel tray by leaning it on the gel box wall farthest from the top comb, and slowly tipping it into the box.Do not leave for longer than 24 hours, as contaminants might have a chance to grow and the plates could dry out.If your cuvette arcs (bright flash and loud popping noise during electroporation):Wash out and sterilize the cuvette with ethanol \x96 the cells have been pretty much killed and will not be usable in plating, so you need to restart.Glycerol Stocks are one of the best ways to store cells and DNA for long periods of time.CTAB is just above its soluble conditions at normal room temperature, and if the atmospheric pressure is low the day you are extracting DNA, it might come out of solution.Prepare two water baths, one boiling and the other 68C (this can also be accomplished with just the digital waterbath, by bringing the temp to 99/100C, then adding some water to the tank to help it cool down to 68C by the time that water temp is needed)Centrifuge the 12 ml tubes containing the 5 ml cultures in the large centrifuge at 3K RPM for 10 min.NOTE: addition of extra WB or lower amounts of DNA will reduce the time constant as well, so it is only a rough measure.To remove the cells from the cuvette add 1 mL LB media or SOC media (no antibiotic in this media) to the cuvette.Gel purification has the downside of losing some DNA, and reducing overall DNA concentration (a 120 bp band of DNA in a 2000 bp plasmid will only give .06 µg of DNA if 1 µg of total DNA digest is added to the lane).Make sure the hinge is away from the center of the rotor, this will make the pellet form on the bottom of the tube on the side of the hinge (it might be hard to see or invisible, so this way you know where it should be)Discard supernatant, rinse pellet in 80% ethanol, and let tubes dry upside down with caps open.Re-suspend DNA in ddH2O (50 uL).Always plan for 1-2 lanes of the DNA ladder (2 especially if this gel will be cut up and DNA removed from it), or another suitable control.For separating larger bands, a 0.7% gel is typically used and the smaller DNA fragments are run completely off the bottom of the gel.Solution should lose all blue color, if not, continue inverting until all blue is gone.Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes (keep the hinge out to get the pellet to form correctly)Using a pipette, remove the supernatant from the tubes, and apply to a labeled blue spin column from the kitPour flow-through BACK into the column and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute 17.This prevents bubbles from forming in the gel, and if they do form, forms them near the bottom of the gel.If additional bubbles form in the gel box, while the gel is still liquid take a pipette tip and push the bubbles to the bottom edge of the gel, where they won\x92t interfere with DNA movement.Allow gel to cool for 40 minutes to 1 hour.This is usually done using a marker, a characteristic possessed by cells that have the DNA (or lost by those cells) that distinguishes it from the rest of the colonies that grow up.The small gel box supports gels of 50 mL (potentially up to 75 mL, but 50 is easier to use) and the large gel box supports gels of 200 mL.Set up the gel box by removing the gel tray.The large gel box is also capable of having 2 combs at a time (the second placed ½ down the box), and so its capacity can double at the cost of distance over which it can separate bands.Once your gel box is selected, determine the concentration of gel you wish to make (see description for details).Buffer EB (supplied in the kit) can also be used.The next day, add 1% overnight culture to 5 mL fresh M17-G, and let it grow for 3-4 hours, until you see light growth when you swirl the tubeThe cleared cultured in then centrifuged and filtered with a 10 mL syringe and 0.45 ?m syringe filter into a sterile tube.There are often special freezing boxes that let the freezing occur more slowly, but for E. coli these are generally not needed.To use the glycerol stock to establish a new culture, either scrape a very small amount of the frozen culture off with a pipette tip and add it to a culture (if it is still frozen), or add 10-20 µL of the liquid glycerol stock to the culture (if it is somewhat thawed).The DNA is drawn through the gel using an electric current; the negatively charged phosphates on the DNA backbone being attracted toward the cathode (\x93Run towards red\x94 is a helpful mnemonic as the cathode is generally red colored).The larger the DNA molecule, the longer it takes to fit through the gaps, making its progress through a gel slower than a small DNA molecule.those with the same fluorescent protein but with different promoters) Transformations are any procedure used to insert DNA into a bacteria (if you use a virus, the term becomes transfection).It is necessary when using higher gel concentrations (and recommended for all other concentrations) that the microwaving occur in 30 second increments, with the solution being stirred by GENTLE rotation (wear protective heat gloves) after each 30 second period, to ensure proper agarose distribution.After microwaving add Ethidium Bromide to the gel solution.Then, tip the cuvette on its side so that the space between the plates is vertical, place the 1000 µL pipette tip between the plates, and slowly draw up the solution, while tipping the cuvette further.Commonly, this is the expression of an antibiotic resistance gene included on the transformed DNA, which allows only the cells that have taken up the DNA to survive on a plate in the presence of that antibiotic.Test solidification by gently pressing on the bottom corner of the gel with a finger, it should feel solid and gel-like (not liquid).Slide the gel tray into the gel box so that the open ends of the tray are against the box walls, and so that the rubber seals have not rolled up out of their grooves (if the seals moved, return them to their grooves and try sliding the tray in again).Add the correct gel combs to the gel.This helps reduce arcing, although too much can lower numbers of transformed colonies.Transfer the cell/DNA/WB solution into the cuvettes by pipetting up and down in the 1.5 mL tube first to mix.These stocks are prepared so that the cells in the tubes are still alive, and capable of creating new liquid cultures from small amounts of frozen stock.Apply a small amount of water to the inside of the side walls of the gel box and to the ends of the gel tray that have the rubber seals.Cells need to be made competent before doing this procedure, in order for them to efficiently take up the DNA.Add 500 µL of solution to one plate, spread with the spreading stick, and then spread the spreading stick on the second plate without adding any solution to it.Keep the cuvettes on ice.Before electroporating, dry the cuvettes of with a KimWipe, to ensure no liquid on the surface that could create other paths for the electric pulse (and could cause arcing).Pulse the cells and return cuvette to the ice.Clean and sterilize the electroporation cuvettes by washing with double distilled water (ddH2O) twice and then fill the cuvettes with ethanol.Add 3 µL of DNA to the cell solution.The small gel combs have two sides (one thinner than the other) the thinner side has about 2/3 of the capacity volume of the thick side (which has the capacities listed in #1), so choose what you need.In a flask that can hold at least 4x your gel\x92s volume, add the correct volume of 1x TAE buffer.This should draw up the rest of the liquid in the cuvette.Incubate the cell solutions at 37 °C for 1-2 hours (can go up to three, but try to avoid doing it for that long).Plate the cells on plates containing the correct antibiotic.Example protocol for ligation (to be added to a PCR tube)Add the following reagents to a tube (50 µl reaction) in the following volumes and order: The thermocyler is setup beforehand with the desired protocol.Check the time constant on the machine, a constant of 4.5+ is a very good transformation, and will yield many colonies.SMC-M17-G (recovery media for transformations) = 5ml 2X M17-G + 5 ml 1 M sucrose + 100 µL 2 M MgCl2 + 40 µL 0.5 M CaCl2While waiting, turn on ice machine, turn on centrifuge and set temperature to 4°CMeasure the OD600 of the culture every 30 min for the first 2 hours.Also place 200 µL of 0.15 M NaCl solution in three individual wells to serve as a blankOpen a GFP fluorescence reading protocol in the BioTek Gen5 Data Analysis Software that is connected to the microplate reading instrumentAdjust the excitation and emission wavelengths to the appropriate wavelength peaks for each fluorescent protein.In order to freeze cells and still keep them alive, a cryoprotectant is added to the cultures.The concentration is the mass of agarose/mL of gel x 100%.One issue with transformations is selecting and verifying which colonies have the desired DNA.By varying the concentration of the agarose gel, it is also possible to increase the separation of bands of certain sizes on the gel.Have the settings of the centrifuge at 3500 rpm, 25 min, and 4°C.If they do thaw completely, they can be re-frozen, but repeated thawing may reduce the number of live cells in the stock tube.Make sure the pipette tip is between the metal plates on the cuvette before ejecting the solution.For small band sizes (< 200 bp), it may be necessary to use CIP or TAP dephosphorylation and ligation using the digested DNA solution without gel purification.Determine the number of lanes you wish to run.The main comb for both gels goes into the first notch on the gel tray (should be 1-2 cm from an end), the secondary comb for the large gel is placed in the notch in the middle of the tray.Cyroprotectants function by reducing the freezing point of the solution and act to reduce the formation of large ice crystals inside cells that could rupture membranes.For separating smaller bands, a 2% or 1.5% gel can be used, and run normally.When OD600 reaches between 0.5 and 0.6, take culture out of incubator and place immediately on ice and swirl the contents of the flask to coolStart centrifuging down the cells in the 4x 50mL pre-chilled falcon tubes.Gels are useful for purifying DNA bands of a particular size from restriction digests (to prevent multiple products from forming during ligations) and also for removing proteins from a DNA sample (such as restriction enzymes that are not inactivated by heat).Boil for 45 seconds and centrifuge for 20 min at 13K RPM (or until pellet gets tight).Use a pipette tip to remove the pellet by dragging it (it should be somewhat slimy, but if pelleted well enough, it will hold together), if it doesn\x92t hold together, re-centrifuge and retry.Centrifuge for 5 min at 13K RPM, discard supernatant, and re-suspend in 300 ul of 1.2 M NaCl by vortexing.Optional Step (but gives better yield): incubate for 30 mins in -20oC freezer to help DNA precipitateCentrifuge for 5 min at 13K RPM to compact DNA pellet.', 'result': '', 'safety': 'Ethidium bromide is the main material that we work with that is known to be hazardous, and we wear nitrile rubber gloves when handling this chemical and use the same pipette to transfer it to agarose

Developed and Steps That Could Be Taken to Reduce RisksThere is a relatively low level of risk from the bacteria themselves, even though they would be used in food production.Further work that could be done to reduce risk further might be work with a cre/lox system in the plasmid to remove the antibiotic resistance altogether after the plasmid is known to be in the cells.Since erythromycin is primarily used in treating acne, it s unlikely that the Lactococcus lactis used in cheese culture will come into contact with bacteria causing acne on human skin enough to spread the resistance.The primary concern that may arise is the fact that the bacteria have an antibiotic resistance (erythromycin) in the vector plasmid used to transform our construct into the bacteria.Laws and Regulations

agriculture and slow the impact of runoff.A key area of research for the Nitrogen Project has been to get nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes gaseous nitrogen and converts it to usable nitrates, into non-diazotrophs, which are bacteria that cannot fix their own nitrogen.Streamflow and Nutrient Delivery to the Gulf of Mexico for October 2015 to May 2016 (Preliminary)."Nitrate Levels Continue to

Mississippi River; Signs of Progress in the Illinois River.In the following century, agricultural production exploded and global population soared from 2 to 7 billion people.However, such demand for nitrate fertilizers has taken a toll on the environment.Additionally, we improved the characterization a Heat Shock Promoter (HSP) BioBrick that is supposedly activated at high temperatures but had no previous data on the registry.We also conducted a proof of concept experiment to show these co-factors being utilized by the cell.Before the development of the Haber-Bosch process in 1910, nitrogenous fertilizers were difficult to manufacture on an industrial scale.', 'design': 'From our literature reading, we identified three genes that we believed would help us overproduce intracellular ATP and two genes to overproduce reduced electron donors.The three ATP-producing genes were pck, pgk, and the ATP synthase multi-gene operonpck: Codes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK), a kinase involved in gluconeogenesis that decarboxylates oxaloacetate (OAA) into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and creates ATP in the processpgk: Codes for Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), a kinase involved in glycolysis that converts 1,3-Biphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate by removing a phosphate group and creates ATP in the processThe ATP synthase operon (genes atpA - atpH): These genes code for their respective subunits of ATP synthase, a multi-protein complex that works to produce ATP when on a proton gradient.pBad: a promoter that is induced by the presence of arabinose (Ara) was used for the ATP plasmidspTet: a promoter that is induced by the presence of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) was used for the electron donor plasmidsAdditionally, for each of the electron donor genes (fldA and petF), we created a version of the plasmid with and without pfo (4 plasmids total)We used golden gate assembly to construct the plasmids, with BsaI as the Type IIS restriction enzyme.In order to accomplish this goal, we partitioned the project into three phases:Project Design: Identifying genes of interest (GOI), constructing plasmids, and conducting further modeling (Flux Balance Analysis)Experiments: Transforming the plasmids into DH10B (wild-type E. coli) and measuring for our gene products Proof of concept: Demonstrate the functionality of the plasmids We began by exploring the literature and academic papers on this topic.Unfortunately, ATP synthase was later dropped due to size constraints in cloning.We believed that overexpressing genes that transcribe ATP-producing enzymes would lead to a cell with more intracellular ATP.fldA: Codes for flavodoxin, an electron-transfer protein native to E. colipetF: Codes for ferredoxin, an electron-transfer protein native to SynechocystisE.Our team set out to design an E. coli strain that overproduced ATP and electron donors in order to create a suitable environment for nitrogenase activity, as well as increasing the activity of other cellular functions requiring ATP or reduced electron donors.We wanted to see if ferredoxin could be produced in E. coli and how it would perform relative to the naturally occurring flavodoxin at various levels of expression.We extracted fldA from E. coli MG1655 and petF from Synechocystis 6803.We believed that overexpression of these genes would lead to more reduced electron-transfer proteins available for various cellular uses.In addition to fldA and petF, we also identified pfo as a metabolically relevant.Check out our modeling page to learn why we decided to use this gene and the process of modeling of our Super Cells.Each group of plasmids had a different inducible promoter so we could fine tune the expression of our GOIs to make sure the cell was not

detail:The history of WashU-PSU iGEM teams and the Nitrogen ProjectOur conversation with Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa, who argued that synthetic biology could not end nitrate runoffOur interview of Ray Erhardt, an aquatics engineer, who thought that nitrate runoff must be dealt upstream of wastewater plants and in the fields themselvesWe spoke with members of the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board and the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, who both believed other, natural solutions to excessive fertilizer use could be more effective than synthetic biologyWe interacted with scientists and researchers at Monsanto and Intrexon who suggested new approaches to our project and backed our research and missionOur time spent interacting with future STEM students and high school teachers at Wash U and Missouri S&T and teaching them about synthetic biologyFor the past two years, the WashU-PSU iGEM team has been working to progress the Nitrogen Project.We thought that a cell with the perfect conditions for nitrogenase could also be used with other recombinant proteins \x96 we\x92d just have to select the right conditions to improve.While our new project still fit into the scope of the Nitrogen Project and we continued to understand the impact of nitrate runoff in the agricultural regions around St. Louis, we also began to consider other applications of our research.Nitrates leak from the soil regardless of fertilizer use and, instead, we should work to plant cover crops to soak up the excess.This had a very strong impact on our direction for the project.While we were still motivated to work on the Nitrogen Project, our scope was now adjusted.As a subsidiary of the Nitrogen Project, a multi-university initiative to end nitrate pollution, our focus for human practices was largely based on agriculture.While we were still motivated by this original application of our research, we began to seek out new venues for its use.Finally, we sought out advisors who could comment on the use of our supercells beyond an agricultural setting.While a GMO may be useful, they thought it wasn\x92t the only option, and certainly not the most effective.Next, we reached out to the Missouri Coalition for the Environment.So we tried to carve out a new niche in the Nitrogen Project for ourselves \x96 and we looked outside Wash U for help.Enter Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa.While our lab was not equipped for the method he suggested, we were inspired to use our spectrometer to get a rudimentary idea of ferredoxin and flavodoxin concentrations.Intrexon, another sponsor of the WashU-PSU iGEM team, allowed us to speak with one of their lead microbiologists.If nitrogen-fixing plants won\x92t have the world-changing impacts we believe, were there other problems we could tackle with research that fit within the bounds of the nitrogen project?What other applications weren\x92t we considering?After our conversation with Carlson, we took a closer look at the cellular conditions necessary for nitrogenase function.Initially, we called her to get a better idea of the environmental consequences of nitrate fertilizer runoff in the Midwest.We contacted companies that use synthetic biology for more industrial purposes, and asked them to comment on how our \x93supercharged\x94 cells could be practically utilized.To begin our education on nitrate runoff, we began with faculty within WashU in St. Louis.Mr. Erhardt had several contacts in the St. Louis area, and suggested we reach out to other regional authorities.We contacted the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board, the governing body encouraging sustainable farming practices in our area.However, we didn\x92t want to abandon their work and shirk the resources and knowledge of the professors and graduate students who we would be working alongside all summer.At first, we requested time with Ray Ehrhardt, a professional engineer with a position in the department of Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering.From this experience, we learned that the runoff crisis stretches further than simply a dearth of new agricultural technologies.This summer program allows a group of approximately 30 students to do an experiment in each of the engineering school\x92s main divisions.We discussed our project with local teachers participating in a BioBuilder workshop.They invited us to one of their monthly board meetings, where they commented on the usefulness of our project.Most farms in the midwest are privately owned and operated they said, and it is entirely possible to get these farmers to adopt practices that they believe can mitigate runoff.As for the runoff that does occur from plants, the popularized notion of \x93industrial farms\x94 spraying millions of gallons of fertilizer isn\x92t necessarily true.We explained that the Nitrogen Project aimed to eliminate fertilizer use altogether.From his advice, we recognized that our strain had varied applications in industry as well as agriculture.Throughout the course of our project, we sought to apply our knowledge of synthetic biology through education wherever possible:We led two synthetic biology workshops for Washington University\x92s pre-engineering institute.We found that the teachers were enthusiastic about including synthetic biology in their curriculums.We helped run a \x93Building with Biology\x94 event at the iGEM heartland regional meetup with our buddies over at UNL and Missouri S&T.One suggestion was that our cells could output ATP in a reactor for other cells\x92 use.Opposed to GMOs, they advocated for other sustainable methods of providing fertilizers to crops \x96 most poignantly, the unused resource of livestock manure that is plentiful in the midwest.In a way, our cells could act as a source of fuel for ATP-intensive processes in other cells.In our first group meetings, we had to determine if we, too, wanted to contribute.The crux of excess nitrate runoff isn\x92t agriculture, they said.In future work, we think a cytochrome assay could prove more indicative of reduced electron donor concentration than a biotin assay.', 'modeling': 'When the wild type 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA reaction was knocked out and replaced with the ferredoxin equivalent reaction, wild type biomass was retained but there was no ferredoxin production.When the objective reaction is biomass production, FBA can be used to predict growth rate at different conditions.The figure above shows FBA as a pipeline.Thus, the pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction was replaced with the ferredoxin equivalent to achieve ferredoxin production.When running FBA, the biotin synthesis reaction carried flux, indicating that under the specified conditions, reduced ferredoxin was being produced.Unlike electron donor modeling, we did not have time to test these modeling predictions in the lab.Ferredoxin yield can be estimated by the ratio of biotin to ferredoxin flux.In order to determine the best possible source, we identified two reactions, knocked those out, and replaced them with equivalent reactions that used ferredoxin as an electron carrier.Biomass production can be achieved through various reactions (Product A, B, and C) and knocking out a reaction (closing a valve) forces the organism to obtain biomass through a specified reaction.aceE codes for a subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), a key enzyme in the pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction.Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is used to predict possible flux distributions that achieve optimal flux through the objective reaction.Flux was minimized over the subset of metabolic reactions that produced ATP and possible knockouts were identified by identifying the reactions that had minimums significantly higher than wild type.In doing this, there could not be negative fluxes when minimizing the flux values (a negative value means the reaction is in the reverse direction) so reversible reactions were split.These discoveries lead to two key wet lab approaches:The pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reaction was knocked out by obtaining a knockout strain for aceE.In the lab, we constructed new electron donor plasmids that had pfo overexpressed along with the electron donor genes.ATP could be further maximized by ensuring higher minimum ATP flux levels.Replacing the original pyruvate to acetyl-CoA reactions allowed for ferredoxin production, but there was less biomass production than wild type.By knocking it out, we were able to knock out the reaction.We modeled its overexpression, which predicts that there should be an increase in the production of reduced electron donors.The binary reactions were then added to the model to ensure that all flux ranges were positive.This ?aceE strain was then used in conjunction with our electron donor plasmids to further increase reduced electron donor productionWe were able to replace the PDH reaction by overexpressing pfo.', 'notebook': 'ATP SYNTHASE 1 RECOVEREDReran PCR on pgk, pck, psc101, and psc102 plasmid

increased amounts of ferredoxin in the cell, which E. coli does not naturally produce and therefore regulate.This graph also shows that our modeling prediction, that ?aceE cells should have increased electron donors due to the knocking out of a competing pathway, was correct.The amount of intracellular ATP initially produced could be determined by adding luciferase and luciferin (the substrate) to

instructors Andreas and Volker (both PhD students at the lab of Prof. Skerra) were present to reflect on our project.Here we enumerate the specific tasks as well as the student(s) who performed them in order to allow the judges to directly contact the student responsible for a topic of interest.As we produced, purified, conjugated, and analyzed many different protein samples, several team members were involved, including Niklas, Jan and Julian.As he spent the last years in Boston at the MIT and at Harvard, he is very open-minded concerning the potential and possible applications of SynBio in the future.In the course of our project, we have met many nice people willing to help and support us with lab space, knowledge, or materials.Wanting to share the project she (and the GRK) looked for a lab participating in the graduate center that could host the iGEM team as main lab.He generously offered all of the resources available at his chair together with the excellent analytical equipment, while letting us free rein to plan and execute the project on our own \x96 and we are very grateful that he provided us with this opportunity!Prof.Prof. Dr. Skerra (our main PI, TUM) already filled the role of the main PI of TUM s 2012 and 2013 iGEM teams and thus had the first-hand experience of what it means to host an iGEM team.He joined our weekly team meeting once after we had decided on our project, giving us several invaluable tips concerning what components to integrate and what aspects to focus on in order to arrive at a proof of principle in the end.Shaker flask productions were conducted independently of other lab members; for fermentation (which turned out to be a somewhat more difficult than explained in lectures), one of our instuctors had an eye on the whole production.Purification with normal columns was performed independently; for those involving the Äkta purifier, a lab member supervised our handling for the first 3 to 5 chromatographies.In the first week, we received an introduction to molecular cloning.He supervised Hallie, an exchange student from the USA who joined our team to create this survey and elucidate how we can make iGEM more productive concerning its output in successful start-up companies.The Wiki was programmed by Peter, a student in Media Informatics (LMU).As an experienced christallographer he was able to create a PAS(200) sequence with lysines that could be used later on for the creation of the PAS animation.We thank Professor Dr. Schnieke and her of Livestock Biotechnology at the WZW (TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan) for so generously providing us with the opportunity to use the micromanipulator at the chair s laboratory and allowing us to conduct several highly specific experiments with our bioink.With the extensive help and instructions of Dr. Nicolas Ortega, a researcher at the lab having much experience with the device, we were able to plan experiments and test our bioprinting technique on a minuscule scale.Below you can find all the stations we stopped by throughout our journey up to the outcome of our project.All work associated with planning, conducting, and evaluating experiments was performed by student members of our team.The hypoxia experiments were performed by Jan and Elena, who were ready to take samples every 12 hours.The flow cytometry experiments were all performed by Luisa as she spent 18 months in a research group in Hamburg before she started her studies in Munich, thus already versed in all skills necessary to measure our cells in FACS.Fluorescence microscopy at the lab of Prof. Skerra was performed by different people as it was necessary for many different sub-projects.Dr. Westmeyer (secondary PI, TUM, Helmholtz center) was asked to join the team halfway through the project when we realized that we required his expertise in the field of fluorescence microscopic imaging.High-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy was conducted at the Helmholtz Center in Munich in the lab of Prof. Westmeyer by Christoph as he will also do his master s thesis in this lab.Samples were prepared by student members of the team, the actual measurement was performed by a technical assistant (which is also true for PhD students).To further characterize the expression of the different receptor constructs our team wanted to take a closer look at the respective mRNA levels.We also want to thank one of his PhD students, Dominik Buschmann, for helping us with the experiments and the analysis of the gathered data.The hypoxia experiments could only be performed thanks to the support of the Schwille Group at the Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried, which kindly provided the required incubation facility.In the end, however, we agreed that the next years of iGEM will most likely witness the establishment of a separate bioprinting track and that this topic has extraordinary potential.5.11 Chemical synthesis of Biotin-NHS active estersAttributions are an important point of any iGEM project as it is necessary to put the results obtained by the team into the context of individual responsibilities.The initial motivation to found this year s iGEM team was sparked by the Graduate Center GRK 2062: Molecular principles of synthetic biology, which desired to re-establish the iGEM competition in Munich.Thus, each of these years saw students wanting to participate in the iGEM competition but facing the bleak perspective that there was no hosting lab that offered the support necessary to make the "iGEM experience".Thus, we will attempt to candidly describe how our project evolved, which student was responsible for which sub-project, and who supported our project with scientific or non-scientific contributions.For the story of finding our project, it is essential to know that there was no iGEM team from either TUM or LMU in 2015 and no team at TUM in 2014.For this reason, he is quite busy and unable invest great amounts of time in the iGEM competition.He received the introduction into staining cells and performing confocal imaging experiments from our external Instructor Jeff.Our colorful Scanning Electron Microscopy images were shot by Prof. Dr. Wanner from the Plant Science Department of the Ludwig-Maximilians University.We are sincerely grateful for his support!For our "linker chemistry" subproject, we needed fresh blood samples as a readily available source of human biotinidase in the form of plasma.For this purpose, Vivien, the student who performed the chemical experiments, utilized her own blood graciously drawn by PD Dr. med.Likewise, the idea for our bioprinting project is far older than just this year \x96 at least in theory.At this point, our last doubts melted, and we were wholly confident that our project choice was just right.As implied above, it was very difficult to convince a professor at TUM of an iGEM participation, and at LMU as well it was cumbersome to find a PI enthusiastic about iGEM now that Prof. Mascher has left Munich.Thomas Skurk, a medical doctor at the Institute for Food & Health.Chemical synthesis was performed by Vivien, as she wrote her bachelor s thesis at the Chair of Organic Chemistry at TUM.If you are interested in the video, please ask her, as she really did it on her own\xa0;)As there was no PDB file available from the PAS-polypeptide we asked the Junior-PI Dr. Andre Schiefner at the Chair of Biological Chemistry (TUM) for help.As he also works in web design and completed his bachelor s thesis in parallel, he was quite busy and did not have overly much time (which is why we finalized our CSS on the last evening).Prof. Dr. Jung (one of our secondary PIs, LMU) is the head of this graduate center and thus impulsed the creation of a team by recruiting students.The initial synthesis plan was discussed with Dr. Martin Dauner, who is the chemist in the lab of Prof. Skerra.In order to do so we asked Professor Dr. Pfaffl for help, since he is one of the leading experts for quantitative PCR.Apart from this session with him, it is his philosophy that iGEM is a student s competition and that the students themselves should design and create the project.In the process, our team members Julian and Javier were able to observe the ejection process under controlled conditions in great detail and document the behavior of our modified HEK cells containing ink.Vivien evaluated all results (including NMR).To be honest, we are very proud that the Maya Video Vivien built looks so great in the end.He supported us, especially in the final weeks, with cell-biological reagents for staining and transfection as well as with the analytical instrumentation of his lab.Instructors assisted the students in planning their experiments, introducing relevant molecular-biological and chemical techniques to the students when they performed a specific experiment for the first time.By the way, it was much encouraging to listen to Randy in Paris when he described the potential of SynBio and chose bioprinting of organs for an example!Moreover, the students evaluated the experiments themselves after an introduction to the theory and advice on what to do and what to avoid.Initial renderings that she showed to the team were far more simple than the final product.', 'background': '', 'description': 'In using a two-component system of genetically engineered cells and proteins, we create a "molecular superglue" that allows precise positioning of cells via bioprinting and locking them in position, allowing the formation of three-dimensional intercellular contacts and physiological microenvironments.Figure 2: Our modified 3D-printer to printing genetically engineered cells, enabling the creation of stable cellular matrices.For cell delivery, we hijacked a conventional 3D printer that can be programmed to inject cells with sub-millimeter precision.Therefore, by providing a tool to render research on a supercellular scale more accessible, we are convinced that our system is able to noticeably advance science in many areas.In addition to establishing the biotINK system itself, we have also worked on several ways to functionalize tissue: To create synthetic organs, we modified cells to secrete insulin in response to external stimuli with infrared light.bio(t)INK - a synthetic biology approach to bioprintingWhile interactions between biomolecules make up cellular systems, the three-dimensional organization of cells makes up tissues and organs.But that s not all: The printing system we created can easily reproduced by any lab around the world provided they have a conventional 3D printer to start with, allowing to print cellular structures as required with only little initial investment.[3]Our ambitious project intends to eliminate these disadvantages: We are able to create three-dimensional cellular structures easily, quickly and at low cost by immediately cross-linking cells into a protein/cell-matrix upon printing.[2]Figure 1: A vision of bioprinting in the future: designing and printing whole organs in the lab.So far, Bioprinting systems have not been able to distinctly impact either of these fields.While much on the molecular interactions within cells is known, comparatively little is known about the complex interactions of cells with each other.For decades, scientists have tried to reconstitute such functional tissues by assembling the cells they are made of \x96 especially for the field of regenerative medicine, where acquiring \x96 or failing to acquire \x96 suitable transplants may mean life or death for the patient.[1]Thus, not only could bioprinting prove fruitful in the field of personalized medicine \x96 for pharmacological applications, three-dimensional cell culture systems often constitute the first step in testing a potential pharmacological agent.The technical complexity of the printing process itself makes bioprinting, as it exists now, not only cumbersome but also time-consuming and expensive.Furthermore, the growth of two-dimensional cellular layers does not resemble histogenesis in vivo and is limited to simple tissues that do not require exact positioning or contain multiple cell types.The interactions of cells with each other and the protein matrix are mediated by the strongest non-covalent force found in nature \x96 the biotin-streptavidin interaction.After a certain timespan of in vitro maturation, cells form intercellular contacts and start to grow into two-dimensional cell layers.Apart from the more medically oriented aspects of regenerative medicine and pharmacology, cellular systems are also of great interest for basic and applied research.Furthermore, we have also modified our system to work in bacterial cells.? Murphy, S. V., & Atala, A.', 'design': '[1] For our project, signal peptides constituted a crucial part of many constructs, used to target transmembrane proteins to the cell surface (receptors) and proteins to the ER (BirA), and to secrete proteins into the surrounding medium (luciferase assays to quantify expression levels).Figure 2: Cotranslational translocation of a membrane protein into the ER in a schematic depiction showing the nascent, unfolded peptide chain containing signal peptide (start-transfer sequence) and stop-transfer sequence as well as the ER membrane.Two different variants were used: enhanced monomeric avidin, a single-subunit avidin that is nevertheless able to bind biotin, and single-chain avidin, which resembles the naturally occurring avidin tetramer but consisting of a single polypeptide chain.All receptors mediate the same function: By interacting with streptavidin in the printing reservoir \x96 either directly by presenting biotin (biotin acceptor peptide) or indirectly via binding to a biotinylated linker (single-chain avidin variants), cells are cross-linked due to polyvalent binding of streptavidin molecules in the printing solution to several cellular biotin groups at once.The incredible journey: signal peptides and protein targetingEssential to a protein s function are not only its activity or binding properties, but also its presence at the right time in the right place \x96 the latter in our case being the cell surface.Downstream of this repressor generator we designed and fused a BioBrick (BBa_K2170141) that encodes a double Tet-Operator (Tet-Repressor binding site together with a bacterial promoter and an signal peptide of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA[11]) from E. coli that has a 3  RFC[25] restriction site, allowing the protein fusion of proteins that are secreted into the bacterial periplasm when expressed with this BioBrick.the position occupied by the RFC10 cloning scar.Since both the distance from the promoter to the open reading frame and the Kozak consensus sequence are considered crucial parameters for expression levels[6], BM40 and Ig? signal peptide constructs are likely to result in increased expression levels compared to proteins containing the EGFR signal peptide from the parts registry.In order to predict whether our designed signal peptides would be functional, we used the SignalP server, which allows to make theoretical predictions about signal peptide functionality and cleavage.For Ig? and BM40 signal peptide constructs, a T7 promoter spacer as well as a Kozak sequence increase the distance between TATA box and protein-coding region.Apart from the functional parts that mediate the (strept)avidin-biotin interaction, other elements in the receptor were designed to make sure it is optimally translocated to the membrane, as stable as possible, and easily detectable.[4]During this project, three different signal peptide constructs were tested in order to determine that resulting in the highest expression levels: The EGFR signal peptide was taken from the iGEM parts registry (BBa_K157001) and combined with a BioBrick containing the CMV promoter sequence (BBa_K747096) via the RFC10 cloning standard.B) Schematic representation of a receptor presenting an extracellular single-chain avidin that is endogenously biotinylated by a coexpressed biotin ligase (BirA) and thus presents biotin groups at the cell surface.For this purpose, we built two kinds of receptor constructs, both on their own able \x96 when expressed in mammalian cells \x96 to cross-link cells for our approach of bioprinting:1) A receptor presenting an extracellular biotin acceptor peptide that is endogenously biotinylated by a coexpressed biotin ligase (BirA), thus presenting biotin molecules on the cellular surface and allowing it to interact with streptavidin in the printing solution.2) Receptors presenting an extracellular monomeric or single-chain avidin variant.In presenting avidin on the cell surface, cells are able to interact with a co-injected biotinylated linker peptide.C) Schematic depiction of the C-terminal stop-transfer sequence of the receptor.In order to confirm the correct expression and localization of the receptor, the receptor contains three functional elements for its detection for both the N- and the C-terminal receptor domains:  The intracellularly located C-terminal red fluorescent protein mRuby 3 for detection of the receptor via fluorescence microscopy while also providing a stable, folded domain at the C-terminus, an extracellular epitope domain near the N-terminus for immunochemical detection via A3C5-antibody fragments as well as FACS, and  an intracellular Strep-tag II at the N-terminus for the detection and purification via immunochemical methods.Further elements that were included into the expression construct are the CMV promoter for overall high expression levels of the receptor, resulting in a high-avidity-interaction.The BM40 and Ig? signal peptides were designed by us and synthesized with regard to adding additional spacing and functional elements to the 5 -UTR of the constructs, and combined with a BioBrick containing the CMV promoter sequence (BBa_K747096) via the RFC10 cloning standard.With this linker connected to several cell surface avidins as well as streptavidin in the printing solution, a protein matrix is created that embeds cells and allows precise positioning of cells in a three-dimensional manner.Our chosen avidin derivates by design allow functional fusion of the otherwise tetrameric avidin molecule with our receptor.Due to the bacterial signal peptide, the protein is secreted into the bacterial periplasm (the space between the two bacterial membranes of gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli).As a protein fusion, we then assembled a protein cargo domain that is generally exchangeable for any protein that is so small in size that it can be transported through the outer membrane by the EspP autotransporter.The addition of a stop-transfer sequence as in the naturally occurring EGFR sequence, as well as the addition of flexible linkers, makes our EGFR-TMD an improvement over the BioBrick BBa_K157002, which does not possess either of these elements.Figure 4: A) Multiple sequence alignment of human EGFR (see UniProt P00533), the EGFR transmembrane domain BioBrick from the registry (BBa_K157002 and the extended EGFR transmembrane designed by us, containing a charged stop-transfer domain as well as linker elements at the C- and N-termini.The combination of the CMV promoter with the synthesized BM40 and Ig? signal peptides allows for a considerably longer 5\x92-UTR \x96 and can thus be made to contain a full Kozak consensus sequence by design.For this purpose, we designed an autotransporter device that is able to present biotinylated or biotin-binding protein domains on the surface of E. coli.Proteins containing a signal peptide include transmembrane proteins, secreted proteins, proteins of the ER itself, proteins of the Golgi apparatus and several more.Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP autotransporter from E. coli[13][14] which is then followed by a bacterial terminator.Our design features an A3C5-epitope tag further downstream that can be recognized by a high-affinity Fab-fragment and is generally used to detect and quantify the surface display of the cargo domain[12].In the following, we explore the contemplations that contributed to the design of the membrane proteins (also referred to as  receptors ) that allow us to embed eukaryotic and bacterial cells into a stable, three-dimensional and user-definable matrix immediately upon printing.The EGFR signal peptide taken from the parts registry is constructed such that the signal peptide ORF immediately follows the RFC10 cloning scar after the CMV promoter, thus resulting in a very short 5\x92 untranslated region (UTR) of transcribed mRNA.We are sure that this BioBrick will be a valuable contribution to the Parts Registry as it allows future teams to display small protein domains on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli.? Rapoport, T. A.For anchoring in the membrane, a type I membrane protein with defined localization of N- and C-terminus out- and inside of the cell was used.After the integration into the outer membrane, the protein cargo is transported through the beta-barrel of the autotransporter and is presented on the bacterial surface.One ubiquitous element for protein targeting is the signal peptide, which enables translocation of proteins to the ER, from where their journey continues to their place of function.Constructs for bacterial surface display are hereby already well known in the field of protein engineering of therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies.A stop-transfer sequence consisting of charged amino acids - being characteristic for type I membrane proteins - was added at the C-terminus, and the sequence was furthermore flanked by a (GGGGC)2-linker at the N- and C-terminus, respectively.[2]The hydrophobic signal peptide (also called start-transfer sequence) usually consists of less than 30 amino acids [3] and is recognized by the signal recognition particle upon translation at the rough ER, mediating cotranslational translocation of the nascent peptide chain into the ER.High-throughput sorting of an Anticalin library via EspP-mediated functional display on the Escherichia coli cell surface.High-throughput sorting of an Anticalin library via EspP-mediated functional display on the Escherichia coli cell surface.The Kozak sequence is recognized by the ribosome as a translational start site; if this element is missing or deviates from the consensus sequence, this may considerably decrease translation efficiency.[7]Figure 3: A) Schematic depiction of a protein-coding mRNA containing a 5 - and 3 -UTR, the first of which is an important factor in translation efficiency.C) ClustalW multiple sequence alignment of the BM40, EGFR and Ig? signal peptide construct, depicting a gap for the EGFR signal peptide construct compared to the newly designed ones and thus indicating a shorter length of the 5 -UTR .For the termination we chose again a well-working terminator from the distribution plate ("double terminator"; BBa_B0010-BBa_B0012).2.1 The incredible journey: signal peptides and protein targeting3 Design of an autotransporter construct for bacterial surface displayThink before you ink may be a popular slogan wielded by tattoo adversaries, but it has also been perfectly applicable to creating our synthetic biology approach of bioprinting.If the protein expression of the autotransporter is induced using aTc the autotransporter is transcribed and translated.We based our design on the autotransporter EspP[9].The autotransporter system itself is established and functional (see Fig.At the 3 -end, the construct contains the polyadenylation signal of human growth hormone (hGH) for functional polyadenylation of the transcribed mRNA.As soon as the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added to the culture, it binds to the Tet-repressor that can t bind anymore to the Tet-operator and thus the expression of the autotransporter can be regulated.B) Transmembrane domain prediction by the TMHMM 2.0 server, indicating positioning of N- and C-termini out- and inside of the cell, respectively, as well as predicting functionality of transmembrane regions."TetR repressed GFP"; BBa_K577893) that are available in the parts registry, but when we saw that two of the available systems did not work in our own hands, we decided to built the system on our own.The construct constantly produces Tet-repressor that binds to the Tet-Operator and repressed the promoter activity of the autotransporter gene.When present in the bacteria periplasm the autotransporter diffused to the outer membrane and inserts into the membrane.The N-terminal transmembrane ?-helix of human EGFR (UniProt P00533, amino acids 622-653) was herefore chosen (see below the topology prediction of EGFR via the TMHMM 2.0 server for the prediction of transmembrane helices[8]).Plotted probabilities represent the raw cleavage site \x93C-score\x94, the signal peptide \x93S-score\x94 and the combined cleavage site \x93Y-score\x94.[5] For the EGFR signal peptide construct, a Kozak sequence is not present, as it would have to precede the start codon ATG, i.e.Stable expression of the Golgi form and secretory variants of human fucosyltransferase III from BHK-21 cells Purification and characterization of an engineered truncated form from the culture medium.Journal of molecular biology, 400(4), 783-802.? Binder, U., Matschiner, G., Theobald, I., & Skerra, A.', 'human_practice': 'Be assured that your new kidney is growing and there won\x92t be any rejection reaction at all since the kidney is printed for you individually.\x94On his way out, Dr. Müller chokes back his tears, remembering all the patients he saw dying while they were waiting for donor organs before SynBio provided him and his colleagues with the live-saving new technology of organ printing.In situations like these, it is possible to find a donor for Luke.From this imput we came to the idea that it would be a great point for our bioprinting approach if we could dissolve the synthetic tissues upon addition of a substance.The situation in Germany is especially pressing since only very few people are organ donors which results in a huge shortage of available organs.Of course we hope to reduce or even solve this problem with our organ printing technology in the future.In an emergency case in which a doctor decides that the synthetic tissue needs to be removed from the patient he gives the patient a single pill with the prodrug (which is Famciclovir in our case) and all transgenic cells in the patient will suffer from a reduced viability and die in only a few days.The second point we identified from our interviews with experts to be crucial was the printed extracellular matrix composed of recombinant proteins.Her, sitting in the hospital every second day for dialysis while waiting for a suitable donor organ and taking medication for the rest of her life.Again, she hears the calm voice of her father, \x93Modern medicine is unbelievable.However, this depends on finding the right donor with similar biological make-up to Luke, as well as a lot of luck that the transplant will be successful.Today, there is a new possibility.But the worst thing is that your kidney is irreparably damaged,\x94 Chris\x92 father discloses the terrible news.Immediately, Chris has a horror scenario in her head.Suddenly, she feels a soft, warm touch on her right hand and the trembling voice of her mother:\x93Oh darling, I\x92m so happy that you\x92re finally awake.\x94 Chris tries to answer but she can only mumble something incomprehensible.\x93Don\x92t worry,\x94 her dad, sitting on the other side of the bed, replies, \x93you will soon get well again.However, the interviews also sharpened the responsibility that we perceive when dealing with our new method.medical doctors strengthened our sense for the urgency of organ printing even more and we are more convinced than ever before that a successful implementation of the technology could save thousands of lives every year.In our Linker Chemistry subproject we then developed extended linkers that were expected to be easier or harder to cleave by the biotinidase.In fact the real world impact that our technology might have in the future is one of the major reasons that motivated us every day during the last few months.This approach was successful and we found two additional linkers that are easily accessible by means of organic synthesis and the biotin-valin-NHS linker proved to be much more resistant towards biotinidase cleavage.We did our best to combine a healthy optimism that is needed to do cutting-edge science with a responsible communication to vulnerable stakeholders.The kill-switch was implemented into our project as we were asked several times in discussions with experts (such as medical doctors or life science professors) what would happen if we would have some malignant cells in our printed organs.The prodrug-convertase expressed in the printed organ is generally not harmful as long as no problems for the patient occur.\x93A car hit you when you were out on your bike.\x94Her mother interrupts him: \x93Luckily the following car saw you lying at the side of the road and called the ambulance.\x94\x93I don\x92t know how many of your bones are broken.With any luck, 3D organ printing can provide a full and healthy life to Luke and other people in need of organ transplants.A donor organ not only helps the patient but is a relief also for family and friendsHow these tech-moral scenarios influenced our projectDuring the project we often discussed the new possibilities that successful organ printing would have.Some of the experts worried about immunogenicity of these components especially if it was somehow mentioned in the discussion that in the future it could be an aim for the bioprinting sector to print replacement organs.After her eyes gradually adjust to the brightness, she recognizes that she is in a hospital.As it cleaves-off biotin molecules from proteins in the blood it is also capable of dissolving our bioprinted tissue as soon as it is added to the petri dish with the synthetic tissue.With 3D printing, Luke could have a new, healthy liver printed from his very own DNA,\xa0highly reducing risk and improving his chance of complete recovery.Suddenly, there is a thread of hope for Luke s parents and their newborn son.As this case is potentially possible and may also be a factor patients or healthcare officials would probably be sensitized, we started to plan a kill switch.After the emergency operation, the doctor came in and took a DNA sample.Patients on a waiting list for a donor organ are in an extremely stressed situation.She opens her eyes and is blinded by the white bed and the bright wall paint.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': 'Since herpes simplex virus TK is able to phosphorylate guanosine analogues, it has been widely tested as a successful suicide gene in combination with ganciclovir, especially for the treatment of cancers and various virus infections, but also as a kill-switch in various iGEM-projects [7].Therefore, we recommend for in vitro studies to use either ganciclovir or penciclovir, the latter known to be less effective in vitro at least on rat Sertoli cells [21].All strains and lines organisms and cells used were specifically designed for lab applications and are therefore not able to survive outside laboratory conditions as no aspect of our project work overrides these restraints.Biosecurity: No potential misuse or dual-use character in our projectIn order to fully ensure that a project does not allow for any harm to be dealt it is also imperative for the scientists to assess possible harmful misuse of an invention.3 Biosafety: No danger to scientists, the population or the environment4 Biosecurity: No potential misuse or dual-use character in our project6 Flp Recombinase - A stable but reversible genetic alteration7 A practical contribution to Biosafety in iGEM projects: The kill-switch7.1 Aim of the new designed Thymidine kinase / ganciclovir system7.2 The role of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinaseBiosafety is defined as "the discipline addressing the safe handling and containment of infectious microorganisms and hazardous biological materials"[1] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC.For our team, the security and safety measures of our project have had the highest priority.Another positive effect is, that the bystander effect needs direct cell-cell contact because a soluble factor seems not to be involved [13].Upon exposure to a suitable stimulus Flp recombinase will be transcribed and excise the integrated plasmid from our synthetic organ.A practical contribution to Biosafety in iGEM projects: The kill-switchAim of the new designed Thymidine kinase / ganciclovir systemOne key factor in guaranteeing the safety of our project and preventing in advance any dangers is the implementation of a well-known kill-switch.The reason for selecting HSV-TK in combination with GCV is a result of its high specificity for the guanosine analogue compared to thymidine kinases [12].It is worth mentioning how there is a big debate about organ transplantation already since it first became possible in 1945 when the first kidney was successfully transplanted (HRSA).Due to its highly preferential metabolism penciclovir is more commonly selected for GMK-TK30 infected cells [18].Our Kill-Switch construct consists of a CMV-promoter, the GMK-TK30 and an additional Poly-A-tail.In contrast to some guanosine analogues like aciclovir, the active form of famciclovir, penciclovir, is even phosphorylated much more efficiently.Ganciclovir is known as the hydroxymethylated form of aciclovir and is known for its better activity against CMV [15].To get nearer to in vivo conditions in cell culture assays, the diacetyl ester, famciclovir, should be incubated in extracts of liver, previously processed by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase or implemented on a cell culture assay with cells that are capable of effectively transforming famciclovir.Nevertheless, the assumed effect was almost not observable, which shows that in the case of HEK293T cells famciclovir is not well suited for acting as an inducing drug for the GMK-TK30 Kill-Switch.Although HEK293T cells are known to produce aldehyde oxidase [19] and xanthine oxidase [20] the conversion of famciclovir into its active form penciclovir seems not to proceed effectively enough in HEK293T cells in order to be detectable by fluorescence microscopy.This is where the question comes, whether or not a printed organ should be considered as artificial or normal organs.Flp Recombinase - A stable but reversible genetic alterationIn our talks with medical doctors, pharmaceutical companies and the public one question always popped up: \x84Can you undo the genetic engineering after the synthetic organ is transplanted into a humans body?\x93We thought about this tricky question and finally came up with the idea to modify the well established \x84T-REx\x93 system.Like it is in the case with tumor cells, we assume that our printed tissue is dividing more frequently than its environment after implanting, especially if the printed tissue evolves malignant.Nevertheless, we have had an extreme caution to prevent any spreading of used living organisms, since this were S1 genetically modified organisms.The field of synthetic biology provides us with the possibility to work with living organisms and modify them.Since the base of synthetic biology is the work with genetically modified organisms (GMO), it is necessary to look out for risk factors like spreading of the organism or infection from the investigators.Figure 1: Team members listening (except Jan\xa0;) ) to the lecture of Dr. Martin Schlapschy covering safety in the laboratory and the german genetic engineering law.The Laboratory in which the iGEM Project has been conducted, at the Chair of biological chemistry is classified as a laboratory with the biosafety level S1.Although it was demonstrated that phosphorylated GCV metabolites can leak out from cells, only neighboring cells are at risk to be killed by an unknown cellular uptake mechanism independent of gap junctions [14].In order to fulfill the iGEM-competition\x92s philosophy, we intended to improve current BioBricks and the kill-switch, that was implemented for instance in Freiburg 2010 and Slovenia 2012.It is also important to highlight that molecular biology works at the laboratory involve the use of some harmful chemicals, which is another aspect of the safety to be considered.In this case, we worked in cooperation with the iGEM-team of Slovenia and Freiburg, who each provided us with their Biobrick (BBa_K404113 - HSV-thymidine kinase fused to mouse guanylate kinase, iGEM Freiburg 2010 and BBa_K782063 - CMV-promoter, iGEM Slovenia 2012).The \x93bystander effect\x94: tumor regression when a fraction of the tumor mass is genetically modified.The \x93bystander effect\x94: tumor regression when a fraction of the tumor mass is genetically modified.It is assumed that the bystander effect is based on apoptotic cell death.In order to test the functionality of our Kill-Switch, we transfected HEK293T cells with the construct.In the future case of implanting printed tissues into a patient, the bystander effect supports biosafety.It is important to underline some important safety measures that have to be taken while conducting molecular biology experiments:  The use of Ethidium bromide, since it is considered to be a mutagenic chemical compound.As an example the use of big centrifuges, which if mishandled could cause harm to the investigators.Biosafety: No danger to scientists, the population or the environmentIn the daily work with genetically modified microorganisms and cells, it is always important to consider various aspects of biosafety.Its prodrug famciclovir, with two acetyl groups instead of the hydroxyl groups and without the keto group at the purine (see Figure..).When planning and conducting experiments one has to evaluate all potential risks and dangerous posed to human health and the environment thereby and take all eventual necessary precautionary measures (precaution principle).We are suggesting to encode the Flp recombinase, on the same plasmid as the integration cassette, under the control of a tight promoter like the tet-promoter.The trimethylated state is obviously the active form of the prodrugs [9].[3]etbr.html This measures also applied for compounds like Hydrochloric acid and Ammonia, additionally this were to be handled with the protection of a fume hood, due to the volatility of some of them.Nevertheless, all four guanosine analogues show adverse side effects, especially on the male reproductive system [17].The major metabolism of orally admitted famciclovir includes normally a deacetylation followed by oxidation of the purine to form penciclovir.Penciclovir has lower bioavailability than the other two guanosine analogues.Since there are many inherent risks of our work in the iGEM laboratory, we have decided to thoroughly present the dangers that we have analyzed while working at it.This specific kill switch is known as the Thymidine kinase / ganciclovir system.The system is based on a FRT site encoded on a plasmid and another FRT site in the genome.Replacement of the ether oxygen by a carbon atom reflects the structure of penciclovir.This is how the prodrug works in vivo.[2] In order to guarantee the integrity of all the team members and the environment, we took preventive steps prior to the beginning of our lab work.Suggested utilisation of the system for a reversible genetic engineering by inducible excision.Firstly it is relevant to mention that we used non-pathogenic E. coli strains like BL21 and Xl1-blue for the cloning part of the project, which are typical strains used in the labs.After this, all team members were given an introduction to the laboratory, in order to get to know all important safety features as well as localization of the proper lab equipment.Under this principle, general contact with the biological material, for instance, shall be reduced to a minimum.As our project relies on a variety of wet lab work all constructs and experiments were carefully checked ahead of execution.With this design we could ensure that the integration plasmid and the Flp recombinase are always present in any cell.This is why it is very important to consider all these political, social and ethical issues bonded to the scope and effect of the project.In the Level S1 there is considered that no risk for human health or the environment is present.The use of a special protective mask in order to protect the eyes from the UV Light while analyzing gels.But more likely is the excision of an integrated plasmid.Finally, we can only assume that the reason for the weakness of famciclovir as an inducer of apoptosis may be due to its complex metabolism.After a site-directed mutagenesis (Quickchange) the restriction site was removed and the sequence hence repaired.Therefore, we did not only erase point mutations in the mGMK-TK30-construct and added a Poly-A-tail, but went on using the current most modern prodrug: famciclovir.Constructs for example that allow for the production of any kind of toxins or dangerous chemicals as well as genetic code that allows for the integration or transmission of DNA.As we have evaluated our project accordingly we were not able to find any aspect of our work which could be used or modified to serve exterior unwanted purposes.There are many safety measures that are very important to consider while investigating and working at the laboratory for this purpose.After successful transfection of mGMK-TK30 fusion protein the following incubation with one of the mentioned guanosine analogues leads initially to monophosphorylation followed by di- and trimethylation by cellular kinases.At the end, this specificity leads to directed cell death.Upon plasmid loss the integration cassette can no longer be excised and the cell is stable genetically altered.Since a higher frequency of cytokinesis influences transfection positively, printed tissues would be targeted more directly by the bystander effect.No part allows for the production of any kind of harmful substances nor the spread of the construct themselves.The topic of bioprinting, due to the fact of being relatively young, is still currently being discussed in international ethics and safety forums and in courts.First, since for medication 4 common drugs are available on the market, we intended to analyze the differences between them in more detail.Researches address to this phenomenon as the \x93Bystander Effect\x94.The use of certain machines at the laboratory posed some risks as well.To implement a kill switch on famciclovir basis has the clear advantage of using the most actual drug that has higher biocompatibility and bioavailability (41%) in humans.By recombineering of these sites, catalysed by Flp recombinase, the plasmid is integrated.To compare GCV to thymidine, it is 500-fold more catalytic active in the case of thymidine than GCV.These being questions about the ethic of some projects and furthermore the regulation of the reproduction of the same experiments, in the case of its success.[5]Another important factor to consider and discuss is the patentability of such a printer, or in the given case of the printed products.To illustrate this problem, as an example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in charge of regulating medical devices as artificial hearts.All team members that were going to be performing wet lab tasks were required to attend a lecture about the risks and precautions while working with GMOs.With aciclovir the new era of antiviral therapy started in the 1980s.In this presentation information about the regulation of biology by governmental institutions in Germany and the obligations each laboratory has to fulfill e.g.Sequencing results showed a point mutation in both the part by the iGEM team of Freiburg 2010 and the Slovenian part of 2012.It was conducted by Dr. Martin Schlapschy in charge of the safety of the laboratory.?

S., Moolten, F. L., & Abraham, G. N. (1993).Our work in the laboratory was determined not to pose any kind of unusual risks neither to the experimenters nor the general public or the environment.According to the German law of the regulation of GM technology (Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik) there are 4 levels of biosafety, namely from S1 to S4.Considering the fact that the transplantation of these organs needs still years of research of becoming a reality, the governments and regulation organisms are facing a great challenge in regulating the use and manufacture of 3D printed organs.The strict containment of the experiments within the lab was ensured at all times.Quantitative analysis by mRNA measuring of Poly-A-sequence addition showed 4.6-fold higher mRNA stability in comparison to the non-Poly-A-construct.Each one of the Poly-A/Non-Poly-A cross-point-values was proportioned to the negative control and house-keeping gene values.Meanwhile is Organ Donation regulated by other governmental agreements, like in the case of Illinois, the Anatomical gift act.One of the biggest security concerns around the use of 3D printed organs for transplantation is the tort liability of physicians, added to the intellectual property debate of 3D produced organs.? Qiu, R., Horvath, A., & Stahlmann, R. (2016).? Qiu, R., Horvath, A., & Stahlmann, R. (2016).The world is facing a lot of challenges nowadays with the constant improvement and advances in the field of biology.For iGEM, it may be also of great interest to take the mouse GMK since it is soluble in E. coli in comparison to its human analogue [8].Nevertheless, in uninfected cells, host cell kinases phosphorylate both guanosine analogues to a small and similar content.The effect of, for instance, GCV on HSV-negative cells seems to be an in vitro result for experiments where cultured cells contained at least 10% HSV-TK-positive cells.?

DNA (Deng et al., 2012)Using the DNA-binding characteristic of the TAL effector, we can generate a new method to increase the production of heterogenous multi-enzymatic reactions in Prokaryotic cells by rationally designed TALE proteins fused with specific enzymes and their corresponding DNA sequences (as known as Binding Motifs [BMs]).And that mutation may disable the whole reporter gene.In order to meet this challenge and make this part easier to use, we designed a pair of prime to remove that additional base and make this part easier to be used.In our project, after properly engineered those two parts, we fused them with the TAL effectors we designed and tested their function.In our experiment, GFP1 was fused with TALE1, GFP2 was fused with TALE2; and SCAF2 (a scaffold where TALE protein can bind) was added into the plasmid.TAL effector nuclease (TALEN) technique is based on the specific and direct combination between DNA and proteins, thus gives us a clue that the compartmentation of multi-enzymes can be achieved based on TALE fused enzymes and corresponding DNA scaffold.TAL effector (TALE) is a family-III effector in Xanthomonas that helps when they infect various plant species [7].Thus, enzymes fused with TALE proteins could be gathered around the DNA scaffolds, enrich the local enzyme concentration, and promote the rate of reaction.Fig.2 A diagrammatic sketch showing the TALE-fused enzymes combine with the scaffold.In our project, we plan to fuse the N-terminal of GFP (A.K.A.Among the registry, BBa_K515100 is the only one available with those two enzymes, but unfortunately, we noticed that this part is a device that contains not only the CDS of those two enzymes but also other parts, and neither of the CDS of those two enzyme were submitted to the registry (they were only registered as BBa_K515000 and K515001).In the current study, we developed a new method to accelerate a multi-enzymatic reaction by integration of a transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-based scaffold system into the bacteria chassis.Compared with strain without basic scaffold D0, IAA output with D0 resulted in a 1.4 fold increase (The result was permitted to be used by the team advisor of ZJU_CHINA 2012).This year in our project, we made an improvement to that system by changing the RNA scaffold system into our TALE-based scaffold system.The result showed a 3.2 fold increase for the TALE1-IAAM/TALE2-IAAH S2 system and a 2.5 fold increase for the TALE1-IAAM/TALE2-IAAH S3 system compared to strain without scaffold S2/S3.[1]C.However, lacking of in vivo compartmentation of the heterologous metabolic pathways, which results in a relevantly low concentration of substrate and enzyme, may cause a low production or productive efficacy, especially when producing through a complex multi-enzymatic cascade.1.5 to 33.5 tandem repeats (TAL repeats), each of which can recognize one specific DNA base pair, were determined in the central DNA binding domain of the TALEs [8,9].However, lacking of the compartmentation of the heterologous metabolic pathways, which result in a relevantly low concentration of substrate and enzyme, may cause a low production or productive efficacy, especially when producing through a complex multi-enzymatic cascade.The effect of the TALE-based scaffold system were tested by the fragmented GFP study and validated by the heterologous production of ndole-3-acetic acid (IAA), is a plant hormone, through incorporating the TALE-fused tryptophan-2-mono-oxygenase (A.K.A.Other methods of engineering TAL effectors acting as transcriptional effectors were also reported.Fig.1 (A) The basic structure of TAL effectors.To fix this, we designed a pair of primers to add a termination codon on the 3\x92 terminal of BBa_I715019 to further extend its usage.When fusing the GFP2 with our TALE2/3, we found the additional T base on the 5\x92 terminal of the BBa_I715020 annoying because it may cause frameshift mutation if we just use the standard Bio-brick assembly to fuse two enzymes.For years, this problem has been bothering researchers in further enlarging the applications of prokaryotic cells in bio-engineering.Hence, multiple manners have been designed to accelerate the multi-enzymatic reactions in prokaryotic cells by physically enriching the local concentration of enzymes and substrates in certain areas of the cell.Unfortunately, it is difficult for the DNA scaffold to assemble as single-stranded loop-stem structure to bind the ligadin in vivo.Meanwhile, the complex structure of the scaffold proteins made it inconvenient for prokaryotic biofactory to correctly fold them, thus limits the application.Description: Engineering of a multi-enzymatic reaction accelerator in vivo based on TALETIPS2: The right NAVIGATE :) posites on content in this page.However, the sample of BBa_I715019 provided by the 2015 DNA distribution does not have a termination codon on its 3\x92 terminal to stop the translation.Accordingly, a recent report applied CRISPER-CAS9 technique as a scaffold system that concentrates specific enzymes for metaplastic functions[6].Subsequently, multi-enzymes were fused with these TALE proteins, which could efficiently guide the enzymes around the DNA scaffolds, to enrich the local enzyme concentration, and promote the rate of reaction.A plasmid backbone was used as the scaffold for those BMs.Different TALEs share a similar domain structure that enables them to bind the genome of the host cell and act as transcriptional effectors.Meanwhile, the different TALE proteins, which could specifically target the corresponding binding motifs, were generated by the assembly of repeat-variable di-residue (RVD) part coding sequences.demonstrated a method to increase the hydrogen production of a heterogenous hydrogen-producing pathway in vivo with rationally designed RNA assemblies[1].In this system, we designed two different random DNA sequences as binding motifs, and then incorporated them into the plasmid.Thus, several improvements were made based on the part K515100 to provide an available version of IAAM and IAAH.Two pairs of primes were designed to decompose this device and gain the CDS of IAAM and IAAHIn the project of ZJU_CHINA 2012, the IAA producing pathway originates from Pseudomonas savastanoi was engineered into E.coli.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report using TALE system as scaffolds for the spatial organization of bacterial metabolism.(Valid when UNFOLDED)For years, prokaryotic cells have been widely applied in synthetic biology and bio-engineering as the host organism.Nevertheless, the limited corresponding ligadin as well as the fragility of RNA itself is challenging the expansibility and stability of such method, which may constrain its further application.However, since the binding between different dCas9-fused proteins and gRNA is relevantly nonspecific, the expandability of such method is still limited.Notably, the recent developed genome editing technique (such as ZFN, TALEN, CRISPER-CAS9), can exactly meet this requirement and come up with clues for new scaffold systems.By physically fusing the TAL effector with the cleavage domain of FokI nucleases, TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) can be created.Mo, its application might be extend to the eukaryotic biofactory as well.Prokaryotic cells have been widely applied as the host cells in bio-engineering and relevant fields for years due to their great advantages in high-speed growth and high productivities against the Eukaryotic Cells.Elsewhere, DNA and proteins have also been tried to be modified as scaffold for similar use [3-5] .Therefore, both of these two scaffold methods remained limited to in vitro applications.Given the importance of developing an in vivo scaffold system that is natural, highly-stable, expandable and simple, a large body of work sought to establish a new method that provokes efficient interaction among different biomacromolecules in vivo.In this prototype, enzyme IAAM and IAAH are fused with different TAL effector so that they can be concentrated around the scaffold.*0.01 < p < 0.05.The results shows that the existence of GFP1 and GFP2 can observably increase the fluorescent intensity.1 Evaluation of the functions of split GFP.J. Moscou, A. J. Bogdanove, A simple cipher governs DNA recognition by TAL effectors.The green fluorescence (Ex: 488 nm; Em: 538 nm) of split GFP was detected after overnight culture of E.coli with or without GFP1/2 under the 1mM of IPTG induction.More recently, similar methods were applied in vivo on acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) [2].A.

Wendisch, Optimization of the IPP Precursor Supply for the Production of Lycopene, Decaprenoxanthin and Astaxanthin by Corynebacterium glutamicum.Silver, In vivo co-localization of enzymes on RNA scaffolds increases metabolic production in a geometrically dependent manner.', 'design': 'In our project, we demonstrated a prototype by fusing the Amino (or Carboxyl) Half of GFP with TALE1 (or TALE2/3).By integrating the coding sequences of the TALE-fused proteins and the scaffold, three different plasmids could be constructed.This prototype is designed to test if our system can achieve our goal of compartmentation by examining if the green florescent intensity raised observably.Our second prototype is designed to determine if our system can actually improve the productivity of a multi-enzymatic system.The IAA production pathway is chosen for this purpose.c. Based on the scaffold we designed, we engineered three different TAL effectors, namely TALE1 (T1), TALE2 (T2) and TALE3 (T3) TALE3 can specifically recognize the REVERSED sequence of BM2: 5\x92-CTTTCCACAAATAG-3\x92NJU_CHINA finished the construction of our first TAL effector (TALE1) and edited the vectors provided by the kit (adding corresponding cutting sites to be specific) to meet the RFC10 bio-brick standard.With their help, we finished the construction of the rest of the TALEs by ourselves using the Golden Gate TALEN and TAL Effector Kit 2.0 by Addgene(R).Specifically, due to the nonspecific interaction between enzyme-fused dCas9 proteins and gRNA, different engineered dCas9 proteins have to compete for gRNA, thus makes the scaffold system unpredictable and uncontrollable.The TALEN technique is based on the direct interaction between TALE protein and the target DNA sequence.The length of DNA BMs and intervening sequences is designed based on the typical in vivo B-type DNA structure, and the structural basis for TALEs targeting DNA.By integrating the coding sequences of the TALE-fused proteins and the scaffold, two different plasmids can be constructed.Accordingly, three different scaffolds were designed to figure out the influence of the spatial orientation and hindering effect on the effectiveness of the scaffold system.1.Among those techniques, ZFN is now being gradually replaced by TALEN and CRISPER-CAS9, and its binding mechanism with DNA is similar to TALEN by the view of molecular biology; CRISPER-CAS9 technique is based on the specific recognition of the gRNA and the target DNA, as well as the relevantly nonspecific interaction between CAS-family protein and gRNA.As mentioned in our project description, different TALEs share a similar domain structure that enables them to bind the genome of the host cell and act as transcriptional effectors.By engineering those structures, we can build proteins that can bind with any DNA sequence that we desire.In our project, we designed two different DNA binding motifs (DNA BMs).This enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of indoleacetamide to indoleacetate and ammonia.This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative carboxylation of L-tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide.Thus, the current development of genome editing technique may give us a clue by achieving those requirements spontaneously.ZFN, TALEN and CRISPER-CAS9 are three famous genome editing techniques nowadays.The protocol can be reached at [PDF]TAL effector construction.Split GFP is a technique that has been widely used in the research of protein-protein interaction.SCAF3 or S3) is designed to test the effect of different length of intervening sequence.', 'human_practice': 'Your project is more like a

UNFOLDED)Considering our project may have an impact on the biopharmaceutical field to a certain extent, especially on the efficiency of the production of drug, we interviewed Hunan Laboratory Animal Center (HLAC) for some advice on safety and prospect.So, if you have some strawberry left, only one and you can see the DNA with your own eyes.By the way, the biological technic is not always so easy, but you can do it yourself in the kitchen, things can get easier.Theoretically, the side effects can be minimized.I have engaged in drug safety assessment many years.Through the communication, we got more ideas and involved in more detailed question about our project.This system is in microorganisms so that we can increase efficiency of regionalization reaction through metabolic engineering of multi-enzymatic reaction.As far as I understand, metabolic engineering is similar with biochemical reactions.Our security assessment is mainly for drugs, such as the safety of medicines produced by the bioactive enzymes, which means we need a specific bioactive substance such as enzymes to conduct the safety assessment.This is because DNA is polarity molecule (and also the RNA and nucleotide), but the ethanol is nonpolar molecule, the DNA can\x92t be dissolved.In this simplified DNA extract process, the adding of detergent is to crush the cells because there are some phosphatide on the cell membrane.After pinch the strawberry, the cell will be broken and the contains will get out.This time in our project, this platform was applied to run our mathematical model, thus brought us advantages in the accuracy of our model.After the detergent has dissolved them, the surface of the cell will be full of little holes.3.After adding the ethanol, the DNA will precipitate out.I think what

pharmaceutical industry.If it leads to an acceleration of cell metabolism, it may eventually make the cell cancerous or autophagy.Increasing reaction rate may result an accumulation of intermediate products which cause side effects.', 'modeling': 'So, the scaffold can improve the multi-enzyme reaction efficiency.However, when the distance between enzyme sites to a extent, the scaffold can aggregate enzymes enough tight, the advantage of scaffold will disappear.1.Thus, the scaffold design improves the reaction efficiency.Analysis: The distance between enzyme sites is enlarged on.The substrates and intermediate products can overlap the enzyme and scaffold spot which can simulate the combination during reaction process.The demo of the reactant motion and interaction (First 30 time units in 3000 time units)Every collision (overlap) between reactant and enzyme is effective as long as the they match.Thus, the scaffold design improves the reaction efficiency.Analysis: The distance between enzyme sites is larger than group1.The core idea is to calculate reaction rate parameters using time driven stochastic simulation method, and compare these parameters of the TALE-based scaffold system and the none-scaffold system.Furthermore, the effect of the multi-enzyme sites on scaffold is studied.The models to study reaction efficiency are based on reaction molecular dynamics.Differently, the scaffold design and none-scaffold design have similar reaction efficiency.Analysis: The multi-enzyme reaction series increases than that above.With the multi-enzyme reaction series increasing, the effect of the scaffold is brought out.3.So, the substrates are consumed in nearly same speed.While because the scaffolds aggregate the enzymes, when the intermediate products try to collide with the second enzyme, it tends to consume less time between collision with enzyme.In other words, in this article, the stochastic simulation method is applied to calculate and assess scaffold system and none-scaffold system parameters in the form of probability distributions.The stochastic simulation starts from COLLISION while the Michaelis-Menten equation basic on the CONCENTRATION.But the effect of the scaffold is more obvious than that above.With the distance between different enzymes sites on one scaffold enlarging, the the effect of the scaffold decreasing.It has same probability between scaffold and none-scaffold design.With the distance between different enzymes sites on one scaffold enlarging, the the effect of the scaffold decreasing.The different enzymes of (b) are linked by scaffold and the scaffold are independently dispersed while those in (c) are independently dispersed.The simulation aims at comparing the scaffold and none-scaffold effect and studying the sites position (on scaffold) effect.And every reaction can be finished instantaneously as long as the collision happened.The smaller blue dots are substrates and the larger blue and red dots are different enzyme.Therefore, the Michaelis-Menten equation is improper to simulate the scaffold \x93aggregation\x94 effect where the reactant is UNEVEN.Stochastic simulation can directly calculate the behavior of every reactant molecule, which can simulate scaffold \x93aggregation\x94 effect.But, similarly, the substrates are consumed in nearly same speed.And the enzyme sites are fixed on scaffolds.The simulation is on two dimension.But the density of reactants, enzyme is relatively near to the real condition.Note1: Return to V.Parameter Setting to see detailed parameter of the group below.Analysis: Although the substrates are consumed in similar speed.The motion of substrates and intermediate products is the composition of the cyclosis and random thermal motion.However, although the Michaelis-Menten equation is derived from the collision behavior characteristics, it presumes that the reactant is UNIFORMLY dispersed in the reaction space and the COLLISION EQUALS CONCENTRATION.when the substrate collision with the first enzyme.So the reactants, enzyme quantities cell diameter are smaller than the E.coli.The TALE-based scaffold system can improve the multi-enzyme reaction efficiency.2.(Valid when UNFOLDED)This model tries to prove theoretically the TALE-based scaffold system can improve the multi-enzyme reaction efficiency.Considering our limited

correspondingly.For this experiment, the plasmids of pSB1C3-Plac-RBS-TALE1-GFP1-Ter-Scaffold1, pSB1C3-Plac-RBS-TALE2-GFP2-Ter-Scaffold2 and pSB1C3-Plac-RBS-TALE3-GFP2-Ter-Scaffold1 were constructed, interpret into E.coli BL21 (DE3), and subsequently induced by IPTG.Increase of IAA production by incorporating the IAAM and IAAH into TALE-DNA scaffold system.Bacterial lysis samples were\xa0cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde without ultrasonic treatment due to the small size of binding plasmid, and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody.The concentration of IAA in the samples is then determined by comparing their OD450 to the standard curves.Subsequently, bacterial samples were harvested and the fluorescence intensity (abbreviated as FI, Ex: 488 nm; Em: 538 nm) were determined by the Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo Scientific).', 'safety': 'We use DH5?and BL21(Ecoli) which are proved to be safe for human, we ensure that none of the genes or parts that we were assembling would act as virulence factors, and that no known pathogens would be involved in our research.As our lab is a new building where the concentration of formaldehyde is very high and it is harmful to our body, we buy lots of activated carbon masks to avoid breathing in too much formaldehyde.Before using every kind of equipment, we read the instructions over and over again to avoid any safety problems, and we cut off the power immediately when do not use them.On the other hand, our production are GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) and IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid) , both of which do no harm to our environment.And our advisors often come to our lab to check in the whole process of the experiment, therefore we can get instructions on time.2.What\x92s more, the expression level of these two production are both very low through our final detection.Our parts are all safe for human, and we use LacI as promoter, which guarantees that our bacteria won\x92t produce large amounts of protein if not induce the expression.Before we start our experiments, our advisors gave us a wonderful lesson about Lab safety.Therefore each time we get out of the lab, we have to take off lab coat, gloves and wash hands with hand sanitizer.2.It is prohibited to bring anything in the lab out including gloves, masks and lab coat.We only use few kinds of toxic chemical reagents( such as glacial acetic acid) and we put them in the fume cupboard, any relevant operations are all done in the fume cupboard.6.However, as it is a kind of nucleic acid dye, we separate a special area for the preparation of agarose gel and agarose gel electrophoresis.As for electrical safety, the electrical engineer of the lab showed us the circuit layout and told us details about the use of these equipments.We are enforced to wear gloves, masks and lab coat once we enter our lab.Our chassis bacteria have not acquired any characteristics that would enable them to compromise human immune system/other systems or evade detection and destruction by the former or facilitate spread between people/animals, which makes them harmless from both a personal and public health point of view.3.And the production GFP and IAA do no harm to human, too.', 'keywords': 'fluorescence representing differences expression discovered centrifuge supernatant concentration maripaludis flow-through', 'track':

'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology (DIQBT) is part of Faculty of phisics sciences and mathematics (FCFM), Univerisdad de Chile.Organization\x92s main objectives are: The group used to participate in different activities in university to spread synthetic biology through workshops and informative talks.Thanks to the activities that the group developed and others that were attended by them, was possible to contact with people interested in being part of the project and very committed to the tasks involved in developing it.Finally we formed the Team iGEM Uchile-OpenBio, we all feel part of the team and if you want to know more about the members of the team we invite you to see our 4000 USD.That team was founded on December 2013 by Luis Rodriguez and Pablo Troncoso (we miss you!).Ignacio Ardiles and Luis Rodriguez created a Sponsorship letter offering to the institutions being our sponsors.Centre for Biotechnology and Bioengineering (CeBiB) is a center of excellence in frontier research by an interdisciplinary team composed of renowned national and international, able to investigate key issues of modern biotechnology and bioengineering, including important applications in industry.', 'background': '', 'description': '', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'For example, if we suppose a constant production of the same amount of PLA and PET (a fossil plastic), after 5 years, higher amounts of PET would b expected to be found because a percentage of PLA should be degraded in the first two years[5] .Here you can see the article written on the websites of Mariano de Schoenstatt high school, and La Maisonnette high school.We also particularly want to thank the Chilean National Commission of Cooperation with UNESCO, which provided us its support to realize this activity through a letter (download here) Last year, for the first time, was implemented an optional course of Synthetic Biology in the Engineering Faculty, that everyone from the different Departments could take.But if PLA had a short degradation time, we guess people would replace it more frequently by buying more PA products, so higher amounts of PLA could be thrown away and the accumulation rate would increase.This was useful to wonder, for example:  After analysing and debating this problem, our main discussions and conclusions were:A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis would bring us a lot of quantitative information about our project, because it would make us know the specific impacts of the production process in term of equivalent CO2 (carbon dioxide) generation[1] .The team also elaborated an electronic glossary to make sure that the concepts wouldn\x92t be forgotten after the activity.As it was the first time that such an activity was implemented, the team asked for students  and teachers  feedback, in order to improve the pedagogical material for the next collaboration with an educational institution.If you are interested in knowing more about how the activity was received, here you can read some comments and see a video recorded at the end of the last activity.We want to thank the two high schools we worked with, for the coordination of the activity and the opportunity they gave us to make the pupils discover this new method: Synthetic Biology.According to the previous reflection, we recommend to use PLA for products which will have a short life-time (<2 years), for example plastic cups or bags.He added that if we could demonstrate our fabrication process is cheaper than the current ones, the project would turn very attractive for many digital fabrication laboratories, for he gave us his support at the end of the visit, sending us another letter of inquiry.We reached the Government through the Ministry of the Environment, which manifested its interest through a letter of inquiry, in which it recognizes the importance of \x93the fabrication of biodegradable materials which implies fewer possible impacts on the environment".In order to evaluate those impacts, the positive and negatives ones, we met with Claudia Mac Lean, in charge of the Sustainability Office of the Faculty.That\x92s why we joined an initiative launched by a professor from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Fernán Federici, aiming to gather people from different Chilean Universities and related to Synthetic Biology into a global organization which could be a Foundation or a NGO.We think one advantage of using macroalgae is that it could close the carbon cycle; it means macroalgae would consume environmental CO2 generated in the PLA production process, allowing global reduction of CO2.On the particular case of medical use, we think PLA should be used like suture, because sutures need to be degraded in a short time.Moreover, the degradation would have no nefast consequences on the organism as PLA is a biocompatible material.We infer PLA can be degraded into lactate, which could enter into the metabolic cycle of anaerobic bacteria, generating CH4 (methane) and/or CO2[2] .Students listening to the explanations of the teacher Alvaro Olivera, about Synthetic Biology.Considering the different projects of OpenBio-UChile, it appeared they would have more impact if they came from a wider organization than a Faculty Organized Group.Nevertheless, we discovered LCA in a late phase of the project, so we didn\x92t have enough time to do this quantitative analysis because we should have looked for all the inputs and outputs of equivalent CO2 of feedstock and energy, for each stage of our process, which is a complex task.If we implemented our project in the long term we would promote cultivation of macroalgae which could contribute to economic development of Chile.We also talked with Andres Briceño, co-founder of the Santiago Fab Lab, to make our project cross the frontier of the University and see if there was a real need or interest for biological PLA.This will be the first organization of that type in Chile which could centralize information about Synthetic Biology and constantly diffuse it through a Web platform in an open data way.She made us present our project to her pupils in the context of a Sustainable Project Workshop and she gave us some pieces of advice, like developping a Life Cycle Assessment analysis or asking us the functionality of our plastic; will it be used for every kind of plastic objects?So the idea of mixing PLA with a more \x93esthetical\x94 material such as wood allows a friendly design for many objects, which makes composite PLA a good candidate for new 3D-printed products.However we felt we were giving birth to something that could impact the Faculty, so the motivation to design the course is still intact.The teaching staff, iGEM team members and the students who came to learn more about Synthetic Biology together after the activity.Moreover, composite PLA can have better mechanical properties than PLA according to the material it is mixed with, and can last more than 2 years without losing its biodegradable properties, which allows a wider range of use.This would help forming responsible citizens.As this kind of activity was new for the high schools the team worked with, teachers helped with internal diffusion and they also invited other teachers and authorities of the institution.To make sure all these concepts had been understood, the team organized a game in which the pupils had to find the word corresponding to the projected pictures and some sweets were given to the winners!Environments without oxygen could be found in typical landfills, so in a hypothetical situation where PLA would be established in our society (it means PLA would have totally replaced plastic from fossil origin), huge amounts of PLA could worsen the global warming (due to greenhouse gases emissions)[3] .This initiative was born in March, 2015 and we met every month to define what would be the objective of the organization, its activities and the ways we could diffuse them.We think the trade off between replacing fossil plastics and avoiding an overproduction of PLA should need further analysis to evaluate the real impact of the PLA production process.When we presented our project, Andres Briceño agreeded that although prices can vary a lot according to the country of origin, it is expensive to buy PLA.The team made an introduction to Synthetic Biology with an activity very similar to the workshop realized in high schools.Also, macroalgae don\x92t require any farmland, fertilizer or fresh water and is a renewable resource, so it is a better alternative than corn cultivation (which is one of the main current production modes).On the contrary, for long life-time products such as pipes, chairs or big structures, it would be appropriate to keep using fossil plastics.Activation, inhibition and production were symbolized by green, red and white threads, respectively.Example of a representation of a genetic circuit: UV light enhances the production of lactate, which inhibits the repressor \x93Inh\x94 of the module responsible for the production of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).In the case of fossil plastic this wouldn\x92t occur because current plastics are made of fossil combustible, which positively contributes to increase global CO2 amounts if they are partially degraded or combusted .On the other hand, the big problem of fossil plastic is its accumulation[5] .Moreover, the team organized an activity opened to the entire Faculty, in which the teacher could talk about the course and answer the questions pupils made.Moreover, pupils are the future professionals of the country, so it is necessary to broaden young minds introducing Synthetic Biology, how it works and its collaborative vision.Since the idea of our project had born talking with the Fab Lab of the University of Chile, as mentioned in the attritubution section (conception of the idea), we presented our project to the director of the Fab Lab, who wrote us a letter of inquiry.To do that, we used all the social networks we had and the institution diffusion channels, designing a poster and several short posts that showed the connection that synthetic biology has with Engineering.Twelve people came to the activity realized in the Faculty and 5 registered the course.As it was planned to open again the course this year, two members of the iGEM team decided to be part of the teaching staff, to re-design and improve the first version of the course, taking advantage of the experience gained with iGEM and including the open source philosophy.Also, the organization is composed of members from different universities and disciplines, where each one has diverse skills which can complement each other, allowing a faster share of information and technological development through collaboration.Conclusion: in the presence of UV light, GFP can be produced.The goal was to make the pupils collaboratively find solutions to the exposed problems, which difficulty grade increased as the workshop progressed.At the date, the organization is composed of members from three universities, the majority coming from the University of Chile since many students are part of OpenBio-UChile.', 'modeling': 'Nilsson, a Olofsson, M.

Mol.As another study, we thought modeling a system without cellular communication between \x93Lactadora\x94 bacteria and \x93PLAdora\x94 bacteria, and to analyze the situation (see Figure 1).Figure 1: A: Our project, two bacteria growing together, the orange producing lactate, green producing PLA; B: Two bacteria growing together, the orange producing lactate without regulation and the green producing PLA; C Two bacteria growing together, the orange producing lactate and the green producing PLA, without communication between them.To simplify the understanding of the process of modeling, we separated this section in 4 principal areas: -\x93Lactadora\x94 bacteria\x94 which includes all assumptions, kinetics and mass balances related to this bacteria -\x93PLAdora\x94 bacteria\x94 that contains all assumptions, kinetics and mass balances related to this second bacteria -\x93The whole system\x94 that shows the assumptions and mass balances involving cellular growing, communication between both bacteria, and the final production of PLA.-We assumed that transport of malate and lactate (as organic acids from glycolysis pathway) are behaved similar between each other, considering that both metabolites are responsible for maintaining cell membrane potential.Taking this on consideration, the equations we used in the modeling, for this first bacteria were:Finally, values of constants per reaction that occurs inside \x93Lactadora\x94 bacteria are in Table 1.It contains the modules that are shown in Figure 3, and the reactions involved in the genetics circuits inside \x93PLAdora\x94 bacteria are:For modeling, we took some assumptions to make the model easier to construct, and to make the difficult labor of looking for the constants kinetics less hard.On one hand, the aim of our modeling was to evaluate how the regulatory network could respond in a two stage cell system, to get a better understanding of how the relaxation times of the reactions will respond to achieve the proper flux for PLA production.On the other hand, we considered an important learning the process to model our system itself, and it would be a reference for other futures UChile-iGEM teams.To construct the model, we searched for all kinetics involved in the genetics circuits, and then constructed the model utilizing CellDesigner and COPASI.[5] K.

Zhang, R. W. Lenz, and S. Goodwin, \x93In vitro polymerization and copolymerization of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA with the PHB synthase from Ralstonia eutropha.,\x94 Biomacromolecules, vol.After then we could consider a cell recirculation system for recovering PLA and cells responsible for the excretion to be utilized again in the reactor.Due to it uses genetically modified bacteria to transform glucose to PLA, which is released to the culture, it is not necessary to kill these bacteria to get PLA, because in this project, PLA is purified and characterized after its production within bacteria.HSL plays a similar part, be produced by the first bacteria, and regulating the polymerization and exportation of PLA.The next stage of the process was to adjust parameters, to obtain the right simulation of the whole system.-We assumed that the concentration of the metabolites 5 -methylthioadenosine and [acyl-carrier protein] are not for determining the reaction rate, so their kinetic constants are assumed high.There are three ways to carry out the reaction after charging the bioreactor with cell y substrate: giving a continuous feed (substrate), giving a semi-continuous feed and without feed, they are called a continuous, fed-batch and batch bioreactor respectively [3].In this project, a continuous bioreactor was used.But now, we have the experience to tell to other new teams that this work is so hard, and it s importante to start working on it as early as they can.[1]N.Rahman, E.

were reported as the mean value ± standard deviation[7].In conclusion, this bioreactor is a sustainable equipment in terms of energy demand for a biological system and nutrient availability.Before writing the equations, it\x92s important to understand what is happening inside the bioreactor.Recent Advances in the Production, Recovery and Applications of Polyhydroxyalkanoates.1, p. 153,

changes for medium preparation and recovery of products, the reactor is where the major chemical and biochemical transformations occur.1, p. 7, 2007.[7]M.-The rate of transcription was determined using the quotient between RNA polymerase speed per nucleotide, and the number of nucleotides per each gene.', 'notebook': 'Then, the project of PLA production in a biological system using synthetic biology tools was formed.After the formation of the PLA project was elected by unanimity, we started to work in the design of the project and in the molecular biology needed to achieve a biological system controlled by a regulatory network that accomplished the principles of synthetic biology.Then the first conception was to enable a biological system that could handle a large production of recombinant proteins derived of a synthetic pathway, and that could be achieved using a controlled system based in the kinetic growth of the microorganism.Thus, a quorum sensing based expression system could handle the metabolic burden involved in a new pathway, and the production of PLA could be sustainable in time.One of the meetings of the recently formed iGEM group, in that time called just \x93OpenBio\x94, we met the Fab-LAB, a group that were interested in a new form of producing a raw material used for 3D printing, Polylactic Acid (PLA).PLA is actually produced by chemical synthesis using an old system called O\x92Ring polymerization, so then a biological system should have comparable yields and low cost of purification process.We formed as an iGEM group in 2014, when we started to have recurrent meetings for creating new ideas of possible projects of synthetic biology, including some projects in the Centre of Bioengineering and Biotechnology.The significant costs associated to this process could be improved implementing a PLA export system that could be similar to a PHA phasins export systems reported.Until that we saw different ways of how to produce polymers of different kind in a biological system, comprehending the metabolic pathways known and searching for new genetic sources.In our first meeting we made several brainstorming considering two main objectives: to generate new ideas of projects and assess the feasibility in terms of experimental design.', 'protocol': '', 'result': 'Colony PCR in transformants with gblocks as insert in pSB1A3.b: A

correspond to the size of 494 bp consistent with amplification of VR and VF2 prfcB (1 to 10).In figure 5 is observed the lane of assembled fragment of TetR (857 bp).The digestion with PstI enzyme is

the upcoming 50 years.As a result of emissions from automobile catalytic converters there are high concentrations of platinum deposited in the soil next to highways and big roads, often higher than in mines.There is an issue with industrial wastewater treatment, minerals and metals accumulate so much that companies discard it instead of using decontamination treatment.Purify the Platinum from other metals or inorganic compounds.Transform it into a highly desirable form - nanoparticles.It is hard to imagine applying modern industrial methods as a solution for recycling the platinum in the soil of big highways.Here, the platinum catalyses oxidation and reduction reactions that neutralize toxic gases emitted during combustion.Platinum is a rare metal because there are only a few mines in the world where it can be obtained.Platinum concentrations are high in plants cause of the treatment of rainwater which is charged with metals et minerals.Platinum is a dense, malleable, ductile, precious and highly unreactive transition metal.The benefit of using the biosorption is to obtain nanoparticles of platinum, a highly valuable form of the metal.Thanks to its catalytic properties and remarkable resistance to corrosion even in high temperatures, it is a highly desired metal.Platinum is widely used in laboratory equipment, platinum resistance thermometers, electrical contacts and electrodes, medical equipment, chemotherapy, jewelry and etc.But most importantly platinum is used as the main catalyst in catalytic converters.An alternative solution to mining could help in the resolution of this issue.Concentrate the platinum accumulated in plants because of phytoremediation or in sludge in rainwater treatment centers.Secondly, there are no current methods of recycling platinum from accumulations in the environment that have been shown to work.Finally, there are also various socio medical complications associated with platinum mining.A modified FliC protein complex will be cloned into E. coli and enable the flagella of the bacterium so that it can bind platinum atoms.In fact since the 90s a legislation has been passed making platinum containing catalytic converters mandatory for all cars in most parts of the world.During the process of extraction huge amounts of hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used to eliminate impurities.Most importantly, platinum resources are draining.If we could exploit these systems and target platinum specifically enough, we could find a durable, simple, cheap and environmentally friendly solution.The main goal of our project is to concentrate the platinum as much as possible.The first step relies on the affinity of small organic molecules, siderophores, to bind solubilized Platinum atoms and thus favor the further solubilisation of more platinum compounds.As a second level of concentrating the platinum even more, we plan to use the principle of biosorption.', 'design': 'To counter this potential issue, we regulate transcription using the arabinose inductible promoter, pBAD/araCIt has to be noted that the siderophore here is specific for platinum but the same cloning could be performed with siderophores specific for others metals, thus our process presents a great potential as it can be applied to others metals thanks to synthetic biology and its modularity.Our strategy for the siderophore mobilisation results in two main steps\xa0: Siderophores binding the platinum ions and others metallic ions1.A simple centrifugation of the flagellin binding the platinum allows to concentrate the metal a second time.? J. de Aberasturi, et al., Minerals Engineering 24, 505 (2011)? P.S Hooda & al.Moreover, any alternative has been found so far to counteract the disparition of this metal compared to its central importance in many industries (electronic, automobile, medical..) .Facing this problem, our goal here is to make a sustainable process, extracting platinum from an other source (road, sludge) than mines ressources, less pollutant, less expensive..Accumulation of the metal on the road side has been frequently shown since the beginning of the 21st century.Importation of the siderophore complexed with the platinum in StreptomycesBiosorption and reduction using flagellin and peptides Adsorption of the platinum on the bacterial surface, Capeness & al.Here, we use the adsorption potentiel of bacterial natural componants (specifically flagellum and biopeptides) to make a process able to extract or concentrate the platinum available on different compartiments like soil, plants, sewege sludge...  Maquette of our process in the futur\xa0: Process has been imagined in a circular platinum economy based on the sludge treatment.Though, valuable ashes obtained would be treated by both steps we made\xa0: the first one is a siderophore treatment making a first concentration of the platinum and other metals, the second one is a flagellin treatment allowing to make industrialisable platinum.To obtain a high transcription level of this sequence, we put transcription control under a strong promoter enabling a high flagellin production.Next, the flagellin produced will be added to the first concentrated platinum solution.During the automobile functioning, the precious metal is rejected and deposed on the road under a ionic form [2][3] Platinum leaching leads to an accumulation of this metal on the road side.Induction and production of the desferrioxamine B.Then, the produced siderophore would be purified and transfered in the recuperation solution containing the platinum and other metals.http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-012-0491-3.? Improving recoveries of platinum and palladium from oxidized Platinum-group element ores of the Great Dyke, Zimbabwe, using the biogenic siderophore Desferrioxamine B, Dennis Kraemer & al.2015 Adsorption of the platinum on the flagellum, Deplenche & al.[8] reduce ions into reduced nanoparticles by the ambient reducer powerAll together, these findings incite us to use these natural properties to build a biobrick which is a high affinity binder of platinum based on E. coli and Desulfovibrio vulgaris flagellum and synthetic peptides.By this way, they extracted approximately 80% of the total platinum found in the ore.By default, it has been prooved that plants are potential bioaccumulator of platinum, which is found accumulated on the roots, leaves or into them.Platinum found on the water retention basin is recovered and incinerated.2008It was shown that proteins are able to bind platinium and especially bacterial flagellums which are naturally a high platinum adsorber [6][7] Furthermore, many peptides were generated based on sequences selected by phage display in order to enhance metal ions adsorption including gold, silver, platinum and a plenty of other metals.Then, on the part of the flagellin facing the external medium, an insertion restriction site will be inserted.Otherwise, the metal is also carried on the sewage sludge and is actually an issue regarding the recycling potential of these sludge.In the previous article [4], authors made bioleaching with chemically synthetised siderophores.And then the platinum come back to it first form and can be recycle and the cycle begin, the cycle of platinum!.Since a law from 1993, platinum is largely used in catalytic converter to avoid toxic gaz release [1].Flagellin containing specific peptides will bind the free or available ions in the medium and reduce them into reduced nanoparticules usable in industry.In consequence, treated sludge are depolluted from metal and can be spreaded on the crops making an additional valorization.Specifically, many articles showed a high affinity of Desferrioxamine B ( produce by Streptomyces coelicolor) for tetravalent metal ions and more specifically platinum.These results encouraged us to make a biobrick coding the sequence corresponding to the 4 enzymes involved on the metabolic pathway of Desferrioxamine B. E. coli was used to produce this biobrick.To this end, we analyze the flagella sequences and structural properties of the external part of the flagella.', 'human_practice': 'This made us realize that

sewage sludge which is a very advantageous process financially speaking.Finally we shared and did popularization on our project by attending to meetings, events and in medias (website, radio, local written press).We presented the synthetic biology toolbox to the general public, and talked about how it could be applied to solve environmental problems such as in those in our project.That why we contacted a expert in process engineering and biotechnology to advise us to determine the feasibility of our project.He showed us to what extend the situation could be critical about metals pollution, that why we found our project relevant.Hence he was really interested in our project we could have had fruitful conversations...The main question that we wondered was how to transpose our process initially designed on a laboratory scale to the industrial scale.We got advise from an expert in process engineering and biotechnology, to construct and define our process and to understand the current industrial possibilities available to biotechnology.We asked the University of Pretoria iGEM team to investigated for us the social issues and conditions of platinum mining, by interviewing experts.We had many fruitful conversations with an ecological engineer who advised us about the current situation and environmental pollution.We wondered if the different social issues around platinum were characteristic to our century and to what extent such issues could have mattered in the past.Thanks to him we have been able to assess and estimate representative values of our project applied on

the environment by a cell in state $mathbf{z}$ .Thus for a particular problem in hand it is necessary to chose$mathbf{z}$ and $mathbf{c}$ that represent the state of cells and themedia.The inhibition constant reduces plasmid replication rate at$\x08ar{dot{mathbf{V}}}(mathbf{z,c})$ rather than $\x08eta $ and$\x08ar{mathbf{R}}(mathbf{z,c})$.The bacteria beingindependant ensures that the behaviour of each individual depends onlyon its internal state $mathbf{z}$ and the conditions $mathbf{c}$ whichare the same for all individuals.mu &= mu_{0} \times e^{-frac{[Toxin]}{IC_{50}}} \\ mu &= mu_{0} \times min(1.0,e^{-k_a(z_1-k_bz_2)}) \\Incorporating 2 toxin anti toxin pairs, if we assumethat the production rate ratio is the same for both, $k_b$, is mu = mu_{0} \times min(1,e^{-k_a(z_1-k_bz_2)})) \times min(1,e^{-k_a(z_2-k_bz_1)}))where $mu_0$ is given by equation 3.These assumptions are probably the most suspectThis initial version of the model has no contention, that is $z_1$ and$z_2$ do not influence the growth rate $mu $.The aim of the model is to assess the evolution of plasmids throughout the culture, to determine which parameters can matter in the loss of those plasmids, and to precise what are the probabilities for a bacteria to loose its plasmids during cell division.As a plasmids can be a disadvantage for growth (energy spent into replicating processes) or a advantage (protection against a toxin) this question is hard to answer.We can see that with D increasing, corresponding to more bacteria growing, more bacteria tend to lose their plasmids and to have various numbers of plasmid.These results can be interpreted by the fact that if D is increasing, thus $µ$ also increases, then bacteria grow faster, and divide faster.With small values of D, bacteria grow slowly and all plasmids have time to be replicated between each cell division.That is why for these values, most bacteria still have maximum values of plasmids and are all in the same situation hence the focusing of the plot for small values of D.If D is higher time for each bacteria to replicate their plasmids between each division is reduced, and the situation of each individual bacteria becomes different, explaining the scattering on the plot.A possibility is that we the genes produce toxin at a constant rate dependant on the numberof copies $k_1\times z_1$, the anti-toxin genes produce anti-toxin at a rate dependant on the number of copies $k_2\times z_2$, anti-toxin instantly and irreversible kills the toxin in a stochiometric manner.But in this situation, where one type of plasmid can influence on the presence of the other type of plasmid in (and reciprocally) in the same bacteria, the question become too tough to answer and only a mathematical model can resolve such a interrogation!In 1967 Fredrickson et al.The maturity parameter has a minimum value of 1 andFor the rates of change of the internal state vector then we propose forthe bacterial maturity to extend the development presented in Shene etal.Of course other factor have shown impact as replication rate of plasmids and the relative toxicity of each toxin.growth in inhibited in an exponential manner by free toxin with a characteristic $IC_{50}$.This model of toxin anti-toxin interaction takes into account thebacteriostatic nature of most such toxins, and the presence ofmeasurable $IC_{50}$ values.plasmids 1 carry the toxin A gene and the anti-toxin B gene plasmids 2 carry the toxin B gene and the anti-toxin A geneSo during the growth each bacterium can have no plasmids, either one type of plasmids, or both types.That cells divide exactly in half, thatis the maturity parameter is exactly halved when the cells divide($delta$ is a Kronecker delta function).The volume is well mixed so theconditions $mathbf{c}$ which are the same everywhere.This show that one of the main factor influencing the loss of plasmid is the growth of bacteria.', 'notebook':

showed cadaverine detection in the wild type meaning the original strain well produces the cadaverine.In cadA mutant from Keio bank, cadaverine was also produced in a least quantity showing that an other pathway is responsible for the production of cadaverine (existence of an other constitutive lysine decarboxylase in the E. coli genome.In the aim to test the flagellin integrity, we made a fliC

consistency of focus, accurate estimates of cell number thrown off by changes in cell shape, bad statistics (not measureing enough cells).First we find that the T7 promoter we used has no leakage and no detectable GFP is synthesised.Comparing the different fluorescence levels qualitatively the results are essentially consistent with those obtained using RFP though the quality (accuracy and precision) of the measurements is better for the TECAN microplate reader and the fluorimeter.To quantitatively compare the measurements with GFP expression and those previously obtained with RFP we have plotted one against the other for our 2 best protocols.The results from this protocol are shown below and show that there is a less good correlation than with the RFP measurements and those from the microplate reader and the fluorimeter.The instrument and its use are described in the methods and protocols section.The standard curve with the Dye shows there is a reasonable linear relationship between the measured fluorescence and the dye concentration (R²=0.96) though this is much less good than we obtained with the fluorimeter or the microplate reader suggesting the measurements are less accurate and reproducible.This curve shows, that under our measurement conditions the fluorimeter is about 100 times more sensitive than the microplate reader, as measured by the slope ; and 5 times more sensitive if we consider the concentration necessary to obtain twice the background measurement (0.5 vs 2.2 ng/ml).Below we show the results obtained for the different promoters measuring fluorescence from diluted cell suspensions.The instrument is also less sensitive than the other machines with a measurement of twice the background at 12.4 ng/ml.The measurements of cell suspensions shown here are less obviously consistent with the RFP measurements than obtained the machines used above.In view of the lower dispersion of the standard curve, and the greater sensitivity of the instrument we expect these results to be slightly better than those obtained using the microplate reader.The microplate reader and fluorimeter are commercial instruments designed to measure fluorescence in solution.These results are completely in agreement with those obtained using the microplate reader, and from the measurements of RFP.While the graph shows an approximately linear relationship it is imperfect, first the scatter suggests a small effect of the coding gene on the strength of the promoter, second the levelling of in the TECAN microplate measurements suggests an instrumentation problem (saturation of some sort) associated with our experimental conditions.We obtained fluorescence measurements with 4 different machines.We could then measure the strength of the promoter we used under standard conditions in a well characterized assay.Each promoter was integrated into a construction expressing GFP Bba_I13504 with a strong/weak RBS (BBa_B0034).We choose to use 4 different methods to study the strength of the different promoters:Each machine (if possible) was calibrated using a standard solution of the dye Atto488.However the results obtained with this simple and cheap device could probably be improved with a little more optimization.A microscope allows us to observe individual cells, this can give further information on the bacteria containing the different expression systems.Our T7 shows very low basal expression barely different from the negative control (477+/-4 vs 224+/-316 for the control) this means that in the absence of induction in the correct strain there is probably no leakage and the promoter does not work at all.The fluorimeter we used is much more sensitive than the microplate reader.We observe a small but significant difference in the slope of the standard curve depending on the buffer showing a slight reduction of fluorescence in LB buffer.The results obtained for the different promoters are shown here.First, as observed with the standard curve, a certain dispersion in the measurements probably arising from an imperfectly optimized protocol.As in the microplate reader, and can be seen in the figure, the standard curve with Atto488 is linear, with very little dispersion of the points.The microplate reader and fluorimeter appear to give the best and easiest to interpret results with the possibility of using a calibration curve to obtain absolute concentrations of GFP.This would need a standard GFP solution for the calibration measurements rather than Atto488.The Magicbox measurements were less accurate and precise.For the cell measurements samples were also 10 times more dilute.This allow us to compare the measurements on the different instruments.The Team AMU decided to study 5 different promoters from the collection in table 1 (J23117, J23106, J23118, J23101 and J23100) and compare also the T7 promoter Bba_K525998 that we used for some of our constructions (J23117, J23106, J23118, J23101 and J23100).In agreement with the previous measurements for RFP the J23100 promoter is the strongest and the J23117 the weakest of those in the promoter collection.Is the physiology of the bacteria seriously modified resulting in bacteria with a strange appearance.In the figure here we show some bacteria expressing GFP from the construction with the strong (1791AU in the table) J23101 promoter.So the samples used, both for the standard curve went only to 0.0175 ug/ml as opposed to 0.7 ug/ml for the microplate reader.', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'U n k n o w n', 'track':

based polyolefin, Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.).Thus, the trap was designed to be placed at the entrance of the hive, in order to act before infection and try to prevent the entry of as many mites as possible.The bees usually enter the hive by landing on the bottom board before walking inside.As in the Groeningen 2012 project, our bacteria need to be separated from the growth medium until the beekeeper decides to use the trap.Thanks to that, the trap can be easily and perfectly installed on the hive by the beekeepers without drilling or cutting.The trap was designed using Catia and then 3D printed in order to build a prototype.In order to get the best out of ApiColi in the treatment of varroosis, we designed a trap named TrApiColi.This trap could not be tested without coating because the porous plastic used for 3D printing is permeable to liquids and gases.Because of the alignment of the trap with the board, it will not disturb the bees  comings and goings.TrApiColi was thought up to take into account ethical reflection, safety and ease of use for beekeepers.Since the switch between the production of the two molecules is regulated by light, our bacteria need to be outside of the beehive.in microaerobic conditions, without agitation and miming batch culture condition), as it would be in the fieldGas diffusion tests: Permeability of butyric acid and formic acid through the TPX® bagCarbone source test: choice of a carbon source to produce acids during at least 10 daysThis channeling does not disturbs the bees.The dimensions of the trap allow it to adapt to almost every beehive.', 'human_practice': 'It was a great starting pointfor us to start some indepth conversation with them about what they knew of DNA and what could be done with it.Some of them weren t aware that banana had DNA at all and some teachers told us that our demonstration was very well designed and easy to understand without distorting the truth.The stand having drawn everybody\x92s attention (thanks to the pungent smell of smashed bananas), our intervention was broadcasted on a local TV (TLT[1]), and we were also selected to take part in International ExpoSciences in Brussels.To carry on with our education mission, we agreed with one of the science teachers from the Leonard de Vinci junior high school of Tournefeuille to meet with the students.On the other hand it is also crucial to make sure that our molecules do not have a negative impact on the bees.Early on in the project, we thought about how best to address the biocontainment issue regarding our bacterial system.Most of the children were not antagonized to the use of a modified bacterium as long as it was confined in our Trapicoli, but we felt that the biological knowledge needed to fully understand synthetic biology was a little foreign to them, so we switched our lecture to focusDuring the Q and A, we were asked about our studies and the kind of diploma we had.In these societies, living beings are held to be untouchable, it is thus necessary to comprehensively explain what synthetic biology is, what our project is, as well as what experiments we are conducting in the lab in order to give clues and keys to people having no background in this field so that we can start to have a discussion with them.It actually seems that we do not have the power to control them entirely, we can only act on a few metabolic pathways, a few functions, at the same time.When discussing the different concepts and approaches of synthetic biology, we have to take into account that ethical reflections depend on the core values of a society and thus differ from one to the other.But, as it was not in our aim to use their research to commercialize an attractive solution of Varroa destructor, we decided to base our research attractive module on the result of this US patent.We had to use a DNA construction designed by Dr Christopher Voigt from Voigt Labs, MIT.You can learn more about this in the video below.Apart from this physical containment, we were also thinking of adding to our system an auxotrophy to a specific nutriment not found in the natural environment.INSA Toulouse is a public school for engineers thus the biosafety guidelines are not specific to our institution; the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms are applied.The regulation on workers  protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No.Christianity having been predominant historically in Western Europe, it still has an influence on people\x92s minds and a notion that could be assimilated to sin still clings to the modification of organisms.We can then ask ourselves the following questions: is it possible to have control over organisms, and if yes, to which extent?In fact, the trap we designed is in itself a first barrier, preventing the engineered bacteria from being in contact with their environment (and particularly the bees).Indeed it is often easier to trust someone when the doubts are clearly stated than when everything is allegedly under control but it cannot be verified.Before we can have any kind of ethical reflection concerning our project, we asked ourselves how to best define our \x93work material\x94, meaning living beings.But since regulations are different around the world, and to have a complete overview of our project, we decided to reflect on the biosafety issue, if our device were to be put in place on hives.Given that DNA is our main work tool, we decided to engage the children by letting them extract DNA from bananas, with ethanol and dishwashing soap.Add the 50ml of water(must be at ambient temperature), the salt and the Dishwashing soapIn the alcohol layer, a white cloud with bubbles should appear, this cloud is DNA!This simple yet interesting experience helped us attract children to our stand.But when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the general public and the environment.This is why we focused a big part of our energy on communicating with the public, in order to raise awareness about a worrying situation.In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures.As new interns we had to take part in a general training session to learn how to identify the risks and preventourselves and our colleagues from harm.It also informs the employee about the emergency numbers.The second one is a training about the techniques used during our stay concerning microbiological, chemical and incendiary risks.We then have a test to make sure that we were understood and aware of the previous presentations.This is the way in which one will be able to identify the barriers and the fears of the public, and understanding them is the first step to conquer them.Our project took place in a research context.In order to discuss our project with people having a first hand experience of the problem, we joined this forum.Indeed a symbiosis between man and specific bacteria is essential to its survival, and we can wonder what the impact of the modification of bacteria interacting (closely or not) with human beings will be.Anthropocentrism, which places human beings above everything and particularly above nature, is the utilitarian vision.When we first started to reach out to the public we realised that the issue of the decline in bee population was a well-known issue.That\x92s why we met with a beekeeper (who was also a microbiologist) to discuss our project and the material restrictions we should submit to.Finally, one issue specific to our project is the fact that the small bag containing bacteria would probably have to be manipulated by beekeepers.Hence, a MTA agreement has been filled with Dr Clark Lagarias from UCDavis, so that we could obtain the strain containing the cyanobacterian light sensors from Dr Nico Claassens, Wageningen University in Netherlands.During the summer, our lab was in the engineering school INSA which possesses a safety department with one prevention advisor and several prevention assistants assigned to the laboratories.As mentioned before, ethics was a dimension that was present from the very first stages of the development of our project.Often being questioned about the fact that \x93researchers play God by modifying living beings\x94, and the prevailing societal distrust, we naturally developed a reflection about the possible limits to give to our project.Formerly, the field of biology matched its greek definition: bios meaning life and logos, study, biology was indeed the study of life and living beings.Finally we took the opportunity of being in Belgium to organize a quick meetup with the KU Leuven iGEM team.Overall this experience in Brussels was quite intense, we met many people interested in science and it was refreshing to be able to get out of the lab and interact with people about our project.Nevertheless the loss of a bacterial colony does not affect us emotionally in the same way the loss of a swarm does.But iGEM does not stop on the 28th of September, and we have everything planned to keep our education project alive after the competition:The "Student s week" occuring in several towns in the Midi-Pyrénées region facilitatesthe integration of new students in Toulouse by allowing them to participate in free events organized by diverseTaking place in Toulouse, Scientilivre ("Science book") is very rightly named and is there to present both books and scienceto the public.At the very beginning of the project, we were not at all specialists of the bees.It is obvious that we cannot let uncontrolled modified organisms disseminate in the environment.The main threat is thus the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where its DNA or RNA would be in contact with microorganisms present in the external environment.A machine is the assembly of known and controllable components, and this term seems to indicate that we assimilate a living being to a completely characterized system responding to physical and chemical laws.We also chose to place this bag in a solid device, adding yet another barrier between the bacteria and the environment.If patenting an organism were possible, it would lead us back to the perception of life as a machine, or a chemical factory, with no sense of wonder or admiration.The name Biobrick is a reminder of the Lego game and this parallel further asks the question of synthetic biology being conceived as an assembly game.We also spent a good deal of our time explaining the iGEM competition to visitors and participants alike, bringing the synthetic biology field, still quite unknown, into light.This communication experience was fully integrated to the Apicoli project, enhancing its exposure and credibility towards the public.One question leading to another, without realising it we where already giving a full guidance lecture on the choices these children would have to make in the following years (which school to attend and why, why study science, etc...).The relationship between humans and environmental bacteria is close, and even more so with the bacteria in our body.)The Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be set up in research laboratories (including containment), education, analysis, anatomy and surgical pathology, autopsy rooms, and industrial and agricultural facilities where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens.The rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (and thus in all public facilities working in scientific and technological domains) are set out in the Decree No.Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are at the heart of a long-term debate on the use of biotechnology in day-life applications.Finally, we do not aim at completely eradicating the parasite from the environment.If we focus on the human being, according to the law, his body does not belong to him, he only has a right of use.Having a first hand account from students who had to go through the same process not so long ago reassured them and gave them some perspective on their future studies.Synthetic biology is also setting off strong opposing reactions and not only because of the use of GMOs.)The main aim of this intervention was to teach children about varroa and synthetic biology while trying to spark an interest in science in general.We made sure to always check that the water-bathes were turned off at the end of the day.To manipulate into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms we used a Biological safety cabinet (FASTER \x96 Ultrasafe).On one hand, we consider nature as fragile and in need of protection whereas on the other hand we see it as strong enough to provide all the resources we need to survive.In the previous decades or centuries, our vision of nature was more pragmatic and focused on the fulfilling of our needs.Science cannot assume that the regulation and policies of Research has to be made by scientists only, rather it is its duty to communicate the results of the researches and to have transparency on the experiments conducted.First of all, we decided to work with the E. Coli chassis, since its genome is very well characterized and it was well adapted to the molecules we wanted to produce.We also cleaned the BSC completely every two weeks.We have a dark room dedicated to the use of EtBr and UV.We talked above about the problem of controlling our modified microorganisms, and we put a lot of thought in the biocontainment issue: how could we prevent the dissemination of our E. Coli modified strain?We based the three parts (attract, eradicate and regulate)At the beginning of our brainstorming about the impact of Varroa destructor on honeybees, we found the patent US 8647615 B1 Represented By The Secretary Of Agriculture via their website.We had a very interesting exchange with the beekeepers about our project and synthetic biology in general, explaining about its principle, its interest and the practicability of our solution with the beekeepers.Our team took part in the regional ExpoSciences in Toulouse.Thus we only wish to slow down the infestation by varroa with our system, to grant honeybees enough time to adapt to the menace and reach a balance with Varroa.We also followed several other trainings that allowed us to use technical apparatus such as autoclave or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).The laboratory safety training requirements of the LISBP are detailed in the Rules and Procedures of the LISBP.Every new LISBP employee has to attend this training session regardless of its status (researcher, PhD student, intern...).The training is divided into two parts.During the summer, we had the great chance to meet and talk with a few ethicians: M. Vincent Gégoire-Delory, M. Simon Desbois and Mrs Anne Cambon-Thomsen.In this case, bacteria directly died if they are in contact with the external environment.For the competition, we have to build genetic constructs called Biobricks.This specific plastic called TPX® is microporous and the size of the pores will not allow the bacteria to pass through.Being aware of the worrying decrease in bee population and having developed an ethical reflection since the beginning of this project, we endeavoured to learn more about the causes of this decrease.This happened at the end of July and our project had matured a lot thus the ExpoSciences was the occasion for us to test its welcome in the real world by exchanging with scientists.For example, if we would like to test our device on an actual hive, it would be by using the chemicals alone, and not the strain that produces them.Hence we asked ourselves the extent to which we could consider our experiments commonplace or ordinary.Our reflection on these ethical issues led us to realize that the reluctance towards the modification of living organisms could be linked to an anthropocentric vision of the world.One might ask if the importance we give to protecting bees does not have its roots in anthropocentrism since bees produce honey, wax and propolis, products we use.He offered us his collaboration, and made available his infrastructures, and his teams.Furthermore, several beekeepers from the forum \x93La Ruche Warré\x94 heard about the project thanks to the same article.Everything in direct contact with something in this room has to stay there.Two specific trash cans are dedicated to the gloves or paper and the contaminated agarose gels.We have described above the relevant security measures taken all through the summer to minimize the risks of incident in the lab.This has changed in the recent years since biology today does not describe life, but rather tries to rebuild some of its important functions.This evolution induced a certain fear in societies marked by an historical creationism springing from monotheistic religions.This increased our visibility, and thanks to an article we were contacted by the Director of the \x93Laboratoire Français d\x92Apidologie\x94 (French Laboratory of Apidology).Therefore the patent does not grant a property right on the biological material.That would designing a specific training for the beekeepers, and a safe way to get rid of the used bags.Another ethical issue that was raised by the concept of modifying living organisms was that of intellectual property.Thus it appears that the use the word machine is somewhat misleading, because biology is much more complicated than that.In order to protect the user, access to the NMR is not allowed for people wearing pacemakers, drug pump systems, staples on soft or hard tissue, and pregnant women.Scientists should be able to acknowledge that they don\x92t know something rather than lying to the public.Bees, Varroas, an introduction to synthetic biology and, of course, banana DNA extraction!We prepared a short presentation about varroa which was followed by a Q and A session where student were able to interact with us and each other about the disappearance of bees, pesticides, varroa and synthetic biology.This way, the bacteria that receive the genes develop new characteristics such as resistance to an antibiotic.They helped us develop our reflexion and they also shared their knowledge with us while still having the skill to let us think by ourselves.This experience also enabled us to meet his Excellency M. Bernard Valero, the ambassador of France in Belgium, and M. Jean-Claude Guiraudon, CIRASTI President and MILSET Honorary President.Other pollinators that do not supply us with interesting goods, such as wasps, are less considered.Furthermore bees are the first pollinating species in terms of fruits and vegetables produced thus the advantages of protecting them are obvious for global trade.Indeed our system would be optimized to last at most 2 to 3 weeks, after which the bag would have to be replaced.2011-1177 is related to the use of genetically modified organisms.One for biological waste (yellow).Contrarily to what one could think, feeling fear as a scientist is essential and should not be overlooked since this is what makes us be more cautious and take a step back to study the implications of our work.Bees have an essential role as pollinators, that\x92s why their preservation is a major social and environmental concern.We used the NMR machine that was kindly made available to us by the MetaToul platform to analyse our culture supernatant.Furthermore we tried to design a system that would be as respectful of the bee\x92s life cycle and products as possible, hence the circadian regulation and natural molecules.Moreover the used parts are also non-pathogenic (the acids doses produced are harmless for humans).With the help of the teacher we were able to explain the basics of synthetic biology, the idea of biobricksand spark a quick debate about GMO use.The bench of the BSC was cleaned with ethanol before and after each manipulation.It is due primarily to the overuse of pesticides that have proven to act as neurotoxins to bees.In fact it seems that normality is illustrated by non living things, completely subjected to the laws of physics and chemistry, and divisible in smaller parts.Still in spite of this, most of the people interviewed weren t aware of the role played by Varroa destructor.Indeed, beeing able to use ethics at an early stage of a scientific project is not only a great opportunity but also a true advantage compared to being included in an already existing project in which you may not have time to think critically.Our project was followed by the regional newspapers (20 minutes, Métronews, La Dépêche), but also by some national magazines such as Capital or Industrie et Technologies.Though it is true that the problem first originated with men, today we cannot solve it by changing our behaviour.In this room, we are able to eat and drink (a fridge, a kettle and a coffeemaker are available) On the contrary, in the lab, we have to wear protective equipment and respect basic rules:We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals.The experience we acquired there was put to good use later and made us able to switch from a full science explanation to a simpler overview of our project without getting boring or simplistic.Indeed using synthetic biology to solve a problem attributed to a human behaviour did not seem relevant to us.When the invisible can have an impact on the visible, fear might arise.You can see here the sterility tests we realized.Another major cause of death for the bees is the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.The Decree No.Naturalists on the contrary believe that nature takes precedence over humans and must be protected from their utilization.A living being can be defined as a thermodynamic open system that receives and passes information, and is in this way a sort of \x93anomaly\x94 of nature since it does not tend towards entropy.Numerous products synthesized through the modification of microorganisms (reprogrammed bacteria\x85) are currently of great significance.This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5.We further realized that the iGEM competition is the perfect moment to develop our ethical thinking.Our team had the wonderful opportunity to take part in the International ExpoSciences in Brussels.The ability to carry out this type of deliberation, to question one\x92s own work, is what singles out a good scientist, in our opinion.Some colonies in Europe seem to start developing behaviours of the same kind.This one is taken individually with the NEO software and the explanations of the prevention assistant.This is a powerful but very expensive equipment, based on the magnetic resonance of the atoms.', 'modeling': 'In our case these maximum values are: Yet, we are interested in the combined effect of AHL and leucine production on the growth rate.From an optimization perspective the equation $mathbf{Sv} = 0$ represents constraints, which guide the numerical In our case the $mathbf{S}$ matrix comes from the in silico E. coli model K-12 MG1665.In our case we are interested in the leucine and AHL production rates of the type A cells and their effect on the growth rate of the bacteria.It also shows that cell A can not operate at the maximum production rate, because the growth rate would then be so slow that cell B would overgrow it.The second reaction of interest is: $$ \text{acylACP} + \text{SAM} \rightarrow \text{ACP} + \text{MTA} + \text{AHL} $$This reaction is important because AHL serves as the key to the motility system of cell B.If our promoters are too strong, the growth rate of cell A will be too low and cell B will be able to overgrow cell A.The metabolic network of the organism in question is represented as a matrix $mathbf{S}$  of size $m \times n$ .This is very important because if cell A has a big metabolic burden and thus, a very low growth rate, cell B would overgrow it and our pattern formation system would not work.To check the effect of our system on the growth rate iGEM Toulouse ran a FB analysis.Finally, the  vector $mathbf{x}$ is defined to contain the concentrations of each metabolite.Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.This is why Toulouse also modeled the effect of one biomolecule, but with the constraint that the other biomolecule is produced at maximum rate.Next  a vector $mathbf{v}$ of length $n$ is defined which contains the flux through each reaction.Here the vector $mathbf{c}$ represents a weight vector.Given this information the Toulouse team was able to locate the reactions of interest in the XML model file, and simulate the cell metabolism.This is something to keep in mind when we choose our promoters for the system.Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.This is the flux that corresponds to a growth rate of 0.This matrix is filled with the stoichiometric constants of each reaction.In generally it follows from the analysis that the more AHL or leucine is produced the smaller the biomass output becomes.The steady state solution Which is the nullspace of $mathbf{S}$.We see that the production values are way smaller in this simulation.We cooperated with Toulouse on the modeling.Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.Each of the $m$ matrix rows represents a unique compound.', 'notebook': 'This successful event was a good opportunity for us to start learning how to design a poster and to communicate about synthetic biology.We held our first meeting without instructors to discuss the design of the constructions needed to create the engineered bacteria.The butyrate genes were cloned into the PL-LacI-ccr pUC57 Plasmid.Blandine took part to iGEM meetup France organized by iGEM Bordeaux Team, where she met different teams, discussing with them, and presenting our project.To do so we designed a booklet explaining our project and what iGEM is.We first started searching for genes that we would like to have in our constructions on the iGEM registry.After we successfully designed our construct we started thinking about what our device would look like.How does the competition works and what are the important deadlines?Those presentations gave us the opportunity to understand more about the iGEM competition and to get to know each other (since we don\x92t all come from the same institutions).First team meeting, our instructors informed us on the competition more specifically and how the team is organized.Here are few examples of projects reviewed: Our youngest instructor and team mother Mathilde Béraud went with Benoît Pons to the FSIE committee, and thanks to their intervention, we obtained \x80 4000 !Start again for the ones that did not work...The first cloning worked for the final construction: a first step has been completed (the formate genes were cloned into the PL-CI pUC57 plasmid).We could now begin the genetic construction, but we faced a problem with the vectors: receptors genes were cloned into vectors incompatible with our final construction plan, so we had to look for an alternative solution.Thomas and Mélany worked together on the attraction module: production of butyrate We received our synthetic genes after more than one month of waiting for them.Another good news was the success of the first steps of the circadian cloning made by Benoît Pons Blandine, who created our Ulule account (Ulule is a crowdfunding platform) informed us that it was a real success.They presented a poster on synthetic biology and the iGEM competition.Anthony met Felix from iGEM Stockholm Team, and discussed about the iGEM experience, all the work done at this moment, his disappointments, \x85 He understood that all iGEM teams were in the same situation: URGENCY.Even if the experiments did not work as expected, all the team smiles again when we received our polo shirts and berets that we will wear in Boston: we are ready to fight !We chose to implement  a circadian rhythm cycle which would allow us to produce toxic molecules during the night when bees are a lot less active.We Skyped with the iGEM Ankara team which is also working on Varroa destructor.We are eager to start, but are a bit pessimistic about the next phase of the project.Two members of our team participated in the Toulouse Exposciences.Indeed, we wanted to combine our efforts to fight against varroa and to gather some data about the mite.Now the real fight begins, hoping to achieve that we planed.The synthetic genes, which were cloned into pUC57 vectors, were amplified and then cloned during the weekend.All the team is now waiting for the synthetic genes and training since the 26th of June.Our reflection led us to the conclusion that our construction should respect the bee life cycle.Two projects were still in course to be chosen, the use of ice nucleating proteins to purify water and the creation of a  bio trap against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.Our first mission was to prepare a presentation for the next week on the following themes:Previous subjects.Following the newspaper articles published we discovered a forum of beekeepers discussing about our project on the web.We realised that our the cloning part would be quite long because of the number of genes needed to obtain... We therefore decided to order synthetic sequences for our synthetic pathway constructions.Laetitia Chaumont, Benoit Pons and Mathilde Beraud went to a laboratory studying varroa(Vacbio EA 4357).Nonetheless, good mood of the team!the bacteria should not produce both attractive and toxic molecules at the same time.This last one was chosen to be our project on the grounds that it  was the most feasible.Every group of two or three students presented one of the subjects seen above.The formate genes (pflA and pflB), the butyrate genes without ccr and the POmpC-LacI box-CI were cloned into pSB1C3.Based on bibliography, the initial idea was to build an engineered bacteria which will have to produce butyrate to attract the parasite.In order to achieve this, Valentin Girin used the software Catia for the modeling of our device.Culture tests were realized for different concentrations of the Biosilta medium.Therefore, we decided to set up a more optimised protocol to assess the attraction of varroa by butyrate.We finished the design of our constructions and send it to our instructors for checking.The production of formic acid in the culture of the producing strain was followed.During the whole week we searched for ways to produce our molecules cyclically.Those results are directly linked to the undergoing cytotoxicity tests.We also initiated the creation of the plans that would be used to 3D print our device.We did cloning trainings to be as efficient as possible, Benoît Pons and Marine Pons succeeded the first cloning at the first attempt !!We also learned more about the beekeeping activity and the treatments used to fight against the parasite.Laetitia Chaumont obtained a meeting with Vincent Grégoire Delory, the ethician of Toulouse White Biotechnology (TWB).Since our bacteria needed to perceive red light we decided to place our device at the entry of the hive but outside.Moreover, it was time to choose attributions to make the project management easier, below in the table, the main assignments.The following weeks were the subject of extensive researches on the topic.They were pleasantly surprised that we took the time to answer all their questions!We prepared some M9 medium, and also did a cytotoxicity test of formic acid thanks to a plate reader.An enzymatic test was done on the Biosilta kit with an OD reading, until the stabilization of bacterial growth.Melissa David, Melany Tanchon and Louise Gody went to Brussels to attend the international Exposciences for the whole week.No doubt, this is the final effort before the dreadful wikifreeze !!The presentations were divided in the following parts.The following weeks were spent brainstorming.During this period, we were informed by iGEM toulouse instructors of what this competition is, and what was expected of us.Strong headaches and itching eyes but still on the computer ?Fighting with HTML tags and continuously looking at the clock ?We received from Dr Nico Claasens lab (Wageningen University) the strains containing PCB en Cph8 vectors responsible for the circadian regulation.However two parameters had to be improved because butyrate is a very volatile molecule and we conducted experiments in a petri dish thus diffusion complicated the interpretation.!We did a cytotoxicity test of butyric acid and we were trained to be able to use the NMR machine.There is only one month left and we have to work harder to reach project goals.We realised two tests: one is a test culture on BW25113 strain under aerobic and micro aerobic conditions.The next step was to present every week, two new project ideas.', 'protocol': 'At the end of first pipe put a sterile cone and immerse it into Eppendorf with NaHCO3After 24 hours culture, press 10 mL syringe in order to expel gas in NaHCO3 solutionNote 1: We used culture in M9 because with the \x93Acids production tests\x94 we had data on this medium.Note 2: 10 mM NaHCO3 solution was used because

gel and 100 pb for 2 %) into the well1a.In order to have varroas in the same phase it is necessary to add one step and it is important for reproducibility of theexperiments.For butyric acid, the concentration chosen 4 % (V/V) because this is the concentration used in the patent quoted (see \x93Attribution\x94 part).We used water as a negative control.For this test we use varroas directly from frames because we did not have enough standardized varroas.Tap on Petri dish and see if varroa moves.We used the same protocol as \x93Culture on Erlenmeyers and TubeSpin® Bioreactors\x94 with some changes: The objective of our device is to produce gas, so we would like to know the gas composition of our culture.For longer products, the extension time has to be prolonged by 1 min/kb.The last step consisting in the elution of the DNA is made with elution buffer or water at 55 °C 2.Use micropipet tip (plastic) To freeze: aliquot cell in 200 ?L volumes into prechilled 0.5 mL microfuge tube

name each colony taken on the tubes and on the plate (A, B, C, \x85)  4.To test gas permeability of TPX® plastic, we use the same protocol as \x93Test of gas concentration\x94.Each PCR reaction has to be adapted to the length of the PCR products, and to the melting temperature Tm of the primers.With this method we place varroas on adult bees so all varroas will be in phoretic phase.With small brush take varroas from Petri dish and put them on bees in box through aeration holesPlace the box in a 35 °C incubator overnight.Resuspend cells in 10 mL of ice-cold TFB1 with gentle re-pipetting.The extension step lasts 1 min for PCR products up to 2 kb.To simplify calculation we noted down formic acid A.We chose a positive control with a higher concentration, 2 mol.L-1, and then decreasing concentration in order to identify which minimum concentration could kill varroa.In the beginning we tested high and low concentrations and we further adapted the concentrations.Resuspend cells in 2 mL of ice-cold TFB2 with gentle re-pipetting.', 'result': 'Our results were in line with our objective to produce acids in a microporous bag because we demonstrated that with microaerobic conditions, To convert the concentration of formate into formic acid we used the famous Henderson Hasselbalch equation:As mentioned in the Eradicate part, our goal was to produce 50 µM of formic acid to kill varroa, and this corresponds to 77,7 mM of formate.Under our microaerobic conditions, the wild type E. coli strain produced 32 mM of formate.Aerobic conditions were obtained with a classical Erlenmeyer incubated at 37 °C with agitation.We used a minimal M9 medium to identify formic or butyric acid production by NMR.Aim: to measure formate production of wild-type strains in microaerobic conditionsIn order to plot biomass concentration we converted the OD values with the following equation:Substrate and products concentration was inferred from the peak area of each molecule on the NMR spectrum.Butyrate production from this pathway remains to be demonstrated prior to testing the strain with varroas.In order to determinate the amount of formic acid required to kill the mite, we tested different concentrations of formic acid on varroas as explained in the Protocol part.Figure 5: Mortality of varroas as a function of time for different formic acid concentrationsFigure 6: Histogram representing mortality of varroas after 2 hours and after 7 hoursFigure 7 presents a dose-dependency of formic acid on varroa mortality.In order to quantify the production of butyrate and formate in these conditions, we  first performed a test with a high concentration of the enzyme (50 U/L) and measured the kinetics of the polymer degradation.Figure 23: Kinetics of Biosilta polymer degradation measured with glucose release.The modeling suggests that concentration the Biosilta medium should even improve formate and butyrate productions but the experimental validation of this production has shown that this is not compatible with E. coli growth.In order to measure BW25113 resistance to different acids concentrations we tested two medium: LB and M9 with 15 mM glucose.For a perfect regulation it would have been necessary to delete the chromosomic version Conclusion: the wild type E. coli strain produces formate in microaerobic conditions but production has to be further improvedAs explained here calculation of the survival of bacteria was perfomed via colony counting after plating on solid agar medium.In order to characterize the E. coli strain growth in the conditions we plan to use in our device, we used a culture under aerobic and micro-aerobic conditions, measured the growth rate (OD) and analyzed the supernatant to measure the concentration of fermentation products.Using a more porous plastic Conclusion: formate permeates through the TPX® while butyrate exchange will need to be improvedThe bacteria impermeability of the TPX® was tested through inoculation of the strain  E. coli BW 25113 in M9 defined medium complemented with glucose inside the bag.As explained in the "Results" part, "attract" section, our objective was to produce at least 0.00001%, so the modelling indicates that we can theoretically reach it.Nevertheless, in order to have this glucose release production, it was necessary to calculate Knowing that one Biosilta kit contains the equivalence of 13 g/L of glucose, we should therefore concentrate the medium 7 times.Thus, we tested different concentrations of Biosilta medium with different enzyme concentrations.Conclusion: Biosilta medium has to be used in a more concentrated manner to reach our growth objectives.Aim: to determine if we can concentrate Biosilta medium to improve the concentration of fermentation products.We do not have the exact composition of Biosilta medium and cannot ascertain innocuity of higher titers of the polymer on growth.In order to model production in the most similar conditions to fit real experiment we chose a glucose rate of 0.0403 g.L-1.h-1 that correspond to 0.72 U/L of enzyme.To convert formate production into formic acid concentration we used equation (3).Thus, to build a biobrick with the full pathway, we cloned the ccr gene with all the genes necessary for butyrate production, as presented below: Figure 2: assembly of the synthetic pathway leading to butyrate production (5192 Kb).On a first assay, we did not detect any permeation of butyric acid through the TPX® bag.We hypothesized that in presence of a carbon source, we may be able to extend even further their survival time period.Figure 22: Bacteria survival test performed with the BW25113 strain on M9 with 15 mM of glucose during 15 days.The cylinder on the left contains the TPX® bag with E. coli BW 25113 immersed in M9 medium after 27 hours of growth at 37 °C.Test of two conditions: without enzyme and with [Enzyme] = 0.72 U/L Figure 25 (right panel) shows that the polymer is not degraded by E. coli which is probably capable of finding another carbon source within the Biosilta medium.Aim: modeling the production of formic and butyric acids as a function of the glucose release rates.We tested our genetic construction in the E. coli strain BW25113 but we did not detect butyrate production.Growth was visualy assessed in the bags after 17 hours at 37°C (figure 14), or with a culture in tube with agitation as a control over the same period (figure 15).Culture of E. coli BW25113 in M9 medium with [glucose] = 15 mM, at 37 °CGlucose was consumed approximately at the same rate for both conditions but was converted differently depending on the condition.Shortly, a solution of butyrate or formate was placed in the TPX® bag.To improve the production of butyrate, we repeated the experiment in a strain with a deletion of the phosphate acetyltransferase gene.of the first DNA fragment matches 5192 pb (butyrate construction) and the size of the second one (2070 pb) matches linearized pSB1C3.In order to test butyrate production, we cultivated ApiColi under micro-aerobic conditions to simulate the growth conditions in the device.Thus, the strain E. coli BW 25113 has been inoculated in a small bag that was sealed.According to the modelling results described in figure 28, we have to produce around 100µmol/L of butyric acid that corresponds to 0.0092% (V/V).Conclusion: The synthetic formate operon is ready to be used in E. coli and sent to the registryFor formate production, we designed a synthetic polycistron coding for pyruvate formate lyase and its activator protein.Culture under micro-aerobic conditions in 10 mL falcon, result obtained after 28.5 hours of culture.Unfortunately we could not detect butyric acid in our NMR analysis, but we observed significant differences for other fermentation products, proving that the synthetic pathway is actually interfering with the fermentation products metabolism.Figure 27: Modelling formic acid production as a function of glucose release for different growth rates (in h-1).Figure 8: assembly of the synthetic pathway leading to formate production (3090 Kb).Figure 33: pH of the two media in function of the concentration of formic acid and butyric acid.As a first step to develop our regulation module, we replaced the butyrate pathway by the RFP reporter gene and the formate pathway by GFP reporter gene.Each condition was tested three times.It is clear that in M9 medium the pH remains at pH 7 at high acid concentrations but not in the LB medium.Optimizing this production will have to be achieved before testing the strain capacity to kill varroas.We want to express the butyrate synthetic pathway by day and the formate synthetic pathway by night.On the right, the negative control cylinder contains a bag of TPX® without bacteria after 27 hours of growth at 37 °C.We then assessed the biomass evolution during long term growth in the TPX® bag (7 to 10 days).We then made a biobrick by subcloning the polycistron in the pSB1C3 plasmid (BBa_K1587007).Figure 9: extracellular substrate and product concentrations with or without formate polycistron overexpression under micro-aerobic conditions.Figure 9 shows that the only difference between ApiColi and the control is in the formate accumulation, so we plotted the specific histogram for formate after 3 days (Figure 10).Over this time, no growth was detected in the medium surrounding the plastic bag.For our system to be efficient, it was necessary to check that butyrate and formate could permeate through the TPX® bag.Hence, we used the mentioned 4 % butyric acid concentration, like the one first mentioned in the patent.Figure 28: Modelling of butyric acid production as a function of glucose release for different growth rates.We observed a maximal formate concentration of 25mM (Figure 9).Therefore our production level is not far from the target.We then checked the viability of the cells after 10 days of growth in the TPX® bag (tube 1, 1  and 2) or in the control tube (tube 3), by spreading diluted volume of the cultures on Petri plates.For the formic acid, we were able to detect it in the gas, probably because its pKa is lower than the butyric acid one.The cph8 biobrick was not obtained but we managed to build a biobrick (BBa_K1587008) with the cph8 encoding sequence under the control of a strong promoter originated from the biobrick (BBa_J23119).In order to have a global idea of the release of glucose per unit of time we then calculated the average rate of release with the following formula:the rate of glucose release necessary to have glucose during 13 days can be calculated with the following formula.Conclusion: It is possible with a Bio Silta Kit to have a continuous release of glucose for 13 days only the one calculated previously.Figure 26: Modeling of formic acid production as a function of different growth rates for a glucose release of 0.0403 g.L-1.h-1.Moreover, it would consume less glucose per hour so we would need a lower polymer concentration in our bag at the beginning.We hypothesized that by deleting the various production pathways for lactate, acetate and ethanol and the degradation pathway forConclusion: Fermentation products concentration can be improved with the enzymatic degradation of the Biosilta polymer.Choice of the carbon source to sustain formic and butyric acids production during 10 days24 hours.This technology is based on polymer degradation by an depolymerisation enzyme leading to a perfect control of the quantity of substrate released in the medium for a given period of time.At 10mM formic acid, all varroas died before three hours but as we explained in the Protocol part, varroas also stop moving at lesser concentrations.In the US patent US 8647615 B1, the concentration of butyric acid that attracts varroa mites is 4 % (V/V), but the final description specified the concentration is efficient from 0.00001 %.However, in the Cytotoxicity part of the results, we also showed that this 4% concentration is lethal for bacteria.Acquisition of the growth stopped due to a problem with the plate reading system where the bacteria where growing.Each condition is tested in three replicates and standard deviation is represented in orange.In M9 medium, the growth is slower at the beginning of the growth curve, however the maximum value of OD reached is almost the same for both medium.The concentration of products (left panel) is clearly different in the two conditions: with the enzyme, more fermentation products are formed.Fermentation products have high concentrations in comparison to the cultures in performed in M9 (15 mM glucose), around 20 times more for lactate, 3 times more for acetate and 2 times more for ethanol.These genes were amplified by PCR and subcloned in pSB1C3 (at this step, a RBS was added to sequence during the PCR).The molecules exchanged between the bag and the surrounding air were desorbed in a solution of sodium bicarbonate.Our final objective was to prepare a bag containing bacteria producing alternatively butyric acid (during the day)and formic acid (during the night) and for a period of time of at least ten days (so that beekeepers don t have to change them every morning...).Doing so, it should be easy to assess the functioning of the light sensor and the NOT logic gate since the colonies should be red by day and green by night.To do so, we synthesized the pOMPC-cI gene (new biobrick BBa_K1587006)Through subcloning the GFP reporter gene (BBa_E0240) was placed under control of this promoter.Except for the 1.5 U/L enzyme concentration, there was an increase of OD in all conditions during 12 days.Culture with BW25113 on 48 wells plate and optical readerFrom these three figures it is evident that we cannot reach the growth level that is expected and that concentrated Biosilta is actually detrimental to growth.Conclusion: concentrating the Biosilta medium is not compatible with E. coli growth.The Biosilta medium was successfully used to have a continuous release of glucose over two weeks.The culture tube contains bacteria growing in parallel of the biological sample tubes shown above (t = 17 hours, 37 °C, 130 rpm).Additional experiments will be needed to go further (test of our enzymes expression, measurements of intracellular pools to identify metabolic locks, growth at other pH, deletions to prevent the accumulation of other fermentation products as explained in [1]...).Conclusion: butyrate production has to be improved in our strain and under our conditions Butyrate is an effective attractant for varroas.Therefore, formic acid permeats through the TPX plastic.Figure 29: Bacteria growth as a function of time for different concentrations of Biosilta medium.Thus, we only had to clone the synthesized genes into pSB1C3 to be sent to the iGEM registry.At the time of this test, there were not a lot of varroas available, so we add to make only one test in order to hope a significant result.We investigated if the bacteria could grow inside a small bag of TPX®.OD600 nm served to monitor a putative growth in the external medium.Figure 15: Control of figure 14 with a growth test of E. coli BW 25113 in a culture tube.We concluded that the bacteria are contained in the bag.The growth tendency is toward a continous increase over the experiment time.This strain produces lower amount of acetate, a fermentation product which production is likely to compete with butyrate.Figure 4: Test of butyrate production in E. coli strain deleted for pta gene.After 2 days and until the end, the growth rate changes gradually and becomes constant, at the highest between 2 and 4 days and decreasing thereafter.With the rate of glucose release calculated above, an FBA and FVA simulation were launched as explained in Modeling part.We will now see if buffering our medium has a positive action on growth.Butyric and formic acids production does not stop the growth within our targeted ranges of concentrations.The same experiment was therefore performed by placing directly the bag in the solution of sodium bicarbonate.After having harvested the supernatant of the culture, we filtrated it prior to do NMR analysis.Similar numbers of colonies were obtained, indicating that the cells survival is the same in both culture conditions.to pass outside the bag in the gas phase.Moreover we now know that bacteria do not grow when the pH is around 5.The first arrow represents the promoter, the others represent genes.The first arrow represents the promoter, the others represent genes.There is a visible difference between the two culture media.This showed that the cells were able to proliferate in the plastic bag.Some conversion between the model and the real condition are necessary and they are also explained there.We did not succeed in associating the three genes together behind a strong promoter in pSB1C3 using the In Fusion cloning technique before the iGEM deadline.This phase was therefore not the one to analyse.Both constructions were placed together on the same plasmid but unfortunately sequencing revealed that there was some incoherence in the RFP sequence, preventing further testing.For our project we need to implement a light sensor system in our strain.Figure 14: Growth test of E. coli BW 25113 inside a small bag of TPX®.to analyse the products and the evolution of the polymer quantity.Likewise, the RFP reporter gene (BBa_K081014) was cloned behind the PL-lacI synthetic gene.This construction (BBa_K1587007) was inserted in the plasmid pSB1C3 to be provided to the iGEM in the biobrick format.', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'polycistronic chromoprotein

lipolytica and Synechocystis JA06 when grown in a co-culture in BG-11 with 5g/l of acetate.As can be seen in Figure 5, the acetate production alone in JA06 is not enough to sustain a stable growth of Y. lipolytica, but can rather only keep a few cells alive.The JA06 strain showed acetate levels of up to 0.22 g/l when grown in regular BG-11, Figure 2, and up to 0.74 g/l when grown in BG-11 with bicarbonate, Figure 3.Fig 2.OD730 and acetate over time for Synechocystis JA06 in BG-11Fig 3.OD730 and acetate over time for Synechocystis JA06 in BG-11 + NaHCO3Although the JA06 strain already showed some promising numbers for acetate production it was believed that this number could have been increased further with the genetic modifications that were planned for the organism.Although the promoter study was completed, the continued work on S. cerevisiae was put on hold for other tasks that at the time were deemed more important.A growth trial was performed on both the WT and JA06 strains of Synechocystis given to us to study its growth rate, Figure 1, and the acetate production, Figure 2 & Figure 3.This is good since it indicates that the added features of the mutant strain does not put any major metabolic burden on the organism.Fig 1.OD730 over time for Synechocystis wild type and JA06 in BG-11When measuring the samples from the growth trial by using HPLC it was shown that the wild type had no acetate production, as was expected.With some of the modifications that were planned for the organisms it is possible that the acetate production would\x92ve been enough for a stable growth.None of the planned modifications were however successfully performed as there were major problems with the assembly and transformation of constructs during the project.A growth trial was performed to investigate the ability of the different organisms to naturally grow on acetate in BG-11 media.This was expected based on the growth trials of Y. lipolytica and JA06.Two initial co-cultures were tested using the unmodified JA06 strain of Synechocystis and the WT of Y. lipolytica.As can be seen in Figure 1 the wild type and mutant strain JA06 of Synechocystis followed a very similar growth curve during the 600 hours long growth trial.The organism that was most successfully grown under the desired conditions was Y. lipolytica, Figure 4.Y. lipolytica has been shown to grow on sucrose after adding a gene for sucrose utilization [2].Secondly, for Synechosystis it might be easier and quicker to knock down the expression of targeted genes than knocking them out, since the multiple copies of chromosomes in Synechosystis makes knocking genes out a labor intensive and slow process [3].But with all the issues that were encountered with the construct assemblies and transformations there was not time to get them working.Fig 4.Yarrowia\x92s OD over time when grown in BG-11 media with 5 g/l acetate.Y.It was thus not possible to carry out many of the desired modifications in the time frame dedicated for the lab work.Which constructs were successfully assembled can be seen in Table 1.Table 1.These were supposed to enable the production organisms for the dependency system of the co-culture and to increase the acetate production of Synechocystis.In one of the co-cultures standard BG-11 media was used, Figure 5, and in the other BG-11 with 5 g/l of acetate was used, Figure 6.It is however positive to see that the co-culture with added acetate seems to show that both organisms can be sustained in a single culture without causing any obvious problems for the other\x92s survival.It is worth noting that the cell density differs by a lot from day to day.There were many planned modifications for each of the 5 organisms that were going to be used.Cell density (x 106) over time for Y. lipolytica and Synechocystis JA06 when grown in a co-culture in BG-11.6.Considering that the current highest obtained concentration of acetate was 0.74 g/l a stable co-culture between the two organisms is not quite possible yet.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'In the case of our cyanobacterium, the limiting substrate in the model is the amino acid produced by the production organism (arginine for E. coli and B. subtilis, and glutamine for S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica), for which Synechocystis is auxotrophic.For that reason, we have only looked at parameters for Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica, the latter being the production organism to have shown the most promise in the lab.Making a parameter estimation for the maximum growth rate was not very difficult for either organism, as we had data from our growth trials.Unfortunately, we ended up not having time to incorporate this last part in the project, but we\x92d like to direct a big \x93thank you\x94 their way for all their help!With this basic model we can study the ratio between Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica that stabilises over time, as can be seen in figure 1.Therefore, after a predictive model is reached, the problem of getting Synechocystis to produce enough acetate for a production organism in co-culture will almost certainly remain a difficult challenge, and one that has to be surmounted when going forward with this project.For this model we have assumed that we will be able to maintain conditions where the amino acid will be the growth-limiting factor.For a substrate-constrained system governed by Monod kinetics, growth can be described with the following equations [1].For the production organism, this is quite realistic, as the only substrate available will be the acetate produced by Synechocystis.The ratio between Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica stabilises over time.Even if the ratio our model returned is not to be taken too seriously, it is not unrealistic that the cyanobacterium should outnumber the production organism, given the premises of the model.Lacking enough time in the lab for this, however, we have elected to make some rough estimations of what these parameters might be, in order to be able to show the model at work.Naturally, this might not be a good approximation, but as we need measurements of our own to get the model to be predictive anyway, this just serves as a first step to see the model in action.At this stage we collaborated with the Manchester iGEM team in order to get help with parameter estimations.Just like in the article, we have not taken cell death into account in this first simple system.The first two rows of equations describe regular substrate-constrained Monod-governed growth, where µ is the growth rate [1/h], n is the cell density [g DW/L], k is the maximum growth rate [1/h], K is the substrate affinity [mol/L], and c is the concentration of cross-fed metabolite [mol/L].Glutamine requirement for Synechocystis proved harder to find a source for, so we did some back-of-the-envelope calculations based on the approximate percentage of cell dry weight that is proteins, and the percentage of amino acid residues in proteins that is glutamine.Here, ? represents the export rate of a nutrient [mol/(g DW*h)] in the organism that produces it.In a coculture where the organisms are dependent on each other for survival, a mathematical model can be useful to predict the stability of the system under different conditions.The closest thing we could find on arginine export rates in Y. lipolytica was the same information for C. glutamicum [4].While this amino acid is required by the cyanobacterium, it is not guaranteed to always be rate limiting.[5]\xa0\xa0 Labarre J, Thuriaux P, Chauvat F. Genetic analysis of amino acid transport in the facultatively heterotrophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.Since no measurements seem to be available for either of the organisms and their limiting substrates, we decided to use the Michaelis-Menten constants for uptake of the relevant substrates as approximations.[1].Our model relies on the assumption that the system is substrate-constrained.Another conceivable limitation is the CO2 used by Synechocystis during photosynthesis, but that should be relatively simple to maintain abundant levels of.? is the required amount of the same nutrient for growth, for the organism that is limited by its availability [mol/g DW].We used MATLAB to solve the differential equations above for two organisms simultaneously, with a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver.Naturally, this provides only a rough estimate.As we got our Synechocystis strain from Josefine Anfelt in Paul Hudson\x92s group at KTH, information on its acetate export rate was readily available in one of their articles [3].The amount of acetate exported by the cyanobacterium is not very high.Parameter estimations for Synechocystis and Y. lipolyticaFor substrate requirement, we found the biomass yield on acetate for Y. lipolytica [2] and inverted it.The ideal solution would be to perform experiments ourselves to measure export rates and growth requirements of the essential nutrients, as well as substrate affinities.We could only find the desired constant for Synechocystis [5], so we used that value for Y. lipolytica as well.1987;169(10):4668-73.2015;33(10):1061.2004;279(10):9125-38.In the last equation, we look at the change in the extracellular concentration of the respective limiting nutrients.The remaining parameters proved more difficult, since there are of course no papers published on the effects of changes we have made ourselves during the project.While the coding itself did not present any problems, finding the correct values for all parameters turned out to be trickier.', 'notebook': 'Check out all the protocols we used in the project.Check out how we made lab work easier to follow

the genetic modifications that were planned for the organism.Although the promoter study was completed, the continued work on S. cerevisiae was put on hold for other tasks that at the time were deemed more important.A growth trial was performed on both the WT and JA06 strains of Synechocystis given to us to study its growth rate, Figure 1, and the acetate production, Figure 2 & Figure 3.This is good since it indicates that the added features of the mutant strain does not put any major metabolic burden on the organism.Fig 1.OD730 over time for Synechocystis wild type and JA06 in BG-11When measuring the samples from the growth trial by using HPLC it was shown that the wild type had no acetate production, as was expected.With some of the modifications that were planned for the organisms it is possible that the acetate production would\x92ve been enough for a stable growth.None of the planned modifications were however successfully performed as there were major problems with the assembly and transformation of constructs during the project.A growth trial was performed to investigate the ability of the different organisms to naturally grow on acetate in BG-11 media.This was expected based on the growth trials of Y. lipolytica and JA06.Two initial co-cultures were tested using the unmodified JA06 strain of Synechocystis and the WT of Y. lipolytica.As can be seen in Figure 1 the wild type and mutant strain JA06 of Synechocystis followed a very similar growth curve during the 600 hours long growth trial.The organism that was most successfully grown under the desired conditions was Y. lipolytica, Figure 4.Y. lipolytica has been shown to grow on sucrose after adding a gene for sucrose utilization [2].Secondly, for Synechosystis it might be easier and quicker to knock down the expression of targeted genes than knocking them out, since the multiple copies of chromosomes in Synechosystis makes knocking genes out a labor intensive and slow process [3].But with all the issues that were encountered with the construct assemblies and transformations there was not time to get them working.Fig 4.Yarrowia\x92s OD over time when grown in BG-11 media with 5 g/l acetate.Y.It was thus not possible to carry out many of the desired modifications in the time frame dedicated for the lab work.Which constructs were successfully assembled can be seen in Table 1.Table 1.These were supposed to enable the production organisms for the dependency system of the co-culture and to increase the acetate production of Synechocystis.In one of the co-cultures standard BG-11 media was used, Figure 5, and in the other BG-11 with 5 g/l of acetate was used, Figure 6.It is however positive to see that the co-culture with added acetate seems to show that both organisms can be sustained in a single culture without causing any obvious problems for the other\x92s survival.It is worth noting that the cell density differs by a lot from day to day.There were many planned modifications for each of the 5 organisms that were going to be used.Cell density (x 106) over time for Y. lipolytica and Synechocystis JA06 when grown in a co-culture in BG-11.6.Considering that the

PCR amplification of another leading to a new, chimeric 16S gene that is not indicative of any bacterial or archaeal species.These reads must be removed to make sure that our data are accurate.Third: we aim to construct a metagenomic library of the microbial DNA found in the porcupine microbiome as a way to isolate and characterize genes for useful cellulose degrading enzymes that can be expressed in E. coli.DNA provides better taxonomic identification than traditional bacteriological assays like Gram stains.It is conserved only in prokaryotes, thus excluding eukaryotes from our identification proceduresIt is a short sequence, which makes it ideal for cheap Sanger DNA equencing and for high-throughput technologies like those used in the Microbiome Survey sectionThe 16S rRNA gene contains nine variable regions, some of which are flanked with constant regions that can be used to amplify smaller fragments that contain the variable regions.This part of our project is designed to determine if a metagenomic library constructed from the DNA extracted from gut microbiomes is indeed useful for biological engineering: in our investigation, we are specifically seeking genes that encode enzymes capable of degrading softwood lumber waste and turning it into useful compounds like bio-plastics and bio-fuels.PICRUSt can then output a predicted metagenome for each 16S sequence picked in the closed OTU picking step and provide inferred gene content for the entire microbiome.The fecal samples contained ton s of bacteria, and we wanted a quick and easy way to ensure there were some cellulose degrading bacteria.We are left with clean, pure genomic DNA from all the cells in the fecal sample.To prepare our genomic DNA sample for illumina sequencing, we first had to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to create many copies of a specific region of the genomes.The taxonomic assignment occurs in 7 steps, which are all wrapped by the pick_denovo_otus script provided by QIIME:Pick OTUs based on sequence similarity within the reads (de-novo picking)Each step here gets us to the OTU table, which can be used for downstream analysis including chart creation and PICRUSt analysis.Lastly we remove low confidence OTUs that are represented by less than 0.1% of the sequencing reads.We must use the QIIME tools to clean up the raw data and retain what is useful.The first step is to align forward and reverse DNA sequence reads, which come out of the sequencer as single-strand reads, and compile them into double-stranded reads.We invite you to check out our entire process and walk with us as we explore the vast possibilities of cellulose degraders, microbiomes and biofuel production.The function of this microbiome survey is to get a handle on what kinds of organisms are present in mammal microbiomes to see if the use of microbiomes as a "mine" for biological engineering purposes is feasible.For 16S sequencing using high-throughput assays, it generally requires a smaller piece of DNA, so these constant regions can be useful when the input size is smaller than the entire gene.When we first begun our project we had every intention of constructing a metagenomic library using the porcupine fecal sample as our environmental isolate.This gene is used widely as a molecular phylogeny taxonomic identifier: analysis of the obtained data will provide us with a good idea of what bacteria are present in each sample.The microbiome helper tool, developed by Dr. Morgan Langille, contains the entire Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, pronounced \x93chime\x94) set of tools which, collectively, are an open-source pipeline that wraps many other tools necessary for the analysis of illumina sequenced 16S rRNA gene data.The incorporation of the vector into a model organism provides that organism with selectable growth advantage, which can help to identify organisms containing the vector.Introduction of vector (and foreign environmental DNA) into a model organism.The DNA extraction step allows us to identify these bacteria through the bacterial DNA found in each fecal sample.Through the use of 16S taxonomy data and through PICRUSt analysis we intend to show that these microbiomes are a gold mine for biological engineering.The wildlife park has been an invaluable resource.Using PCR we amplified all of the 16S regions found in our fecal sample DNA extractions When the PCR-amplified DNA is placed into the flow cell, the adapter region added by PCR binds to complementary oligonucleotides attached to the surface of the flow cell.The resulting sequences were used to identify the bacterial colonies to the Genus level.The 16S rRNA gene, as mentioned in the Microbiome Survey section and here in Isolation, is a perfect gene for taxonomy identification in bacteria.This number is chosen because it is the predicted sample bleed-through on the illumina MiSeq machine, making it a cutoff for removal of low confidence OTUs.Using QIIME we can then create alpha- and beta-diversity charts for the samples, and pie/bar charts for taxonomy for each phylogenetic group (class, family, genus, etc).A chimeric read is a piece of DNA amplified during the PCR step that is a combination of two separate molecules that became joined as a byproduct of PCR.For illumina sequencing, the oligonucleotide primers also contain an adapter region that is added onto the terminus of the amplified 16S rRNA gene DNA, allowing the DNA to be compatible with DNA linked to the illumina sequencer flowcell.To be used in further downstream processes, the large environmental DNA pieces were cut by restriction enzymes which act at specific sites called restriction sitesIncorporation into a vector.This pipeline makes it possible to analyze 16S data efficiently and with accuracy to determine the taxonomy of the microbial community represented by the 16S sequences.contain not only sequences that are important to us, but also chimeric sequences, bad quality sequences, very short sequences and lots of other \x93junk data\x94 that could interfere with our taxonomic assessment down the pipeline.For this task we use QIIME analysis tools with the help of the Integrated Microbiome Resource here at Dalhousie University and Dr. Morgan Langille\x92s Microbiome Helper tool.To fully understand the data that the illumina sequencer gives us, we must use a data analysis pipeline.This was done as a quick and dirty identification of some of the cellulose degrading bacteria as a starting place for our project.These oligonucleotides anneal to a template and provide a free 5\x92-OH group, essentially priming the DNA synthesis reaction; the heat-stable polymerase then amplifies DNA from that template strand.The chemical analysis part of our project allowed us to ensure that using E. coli in the softwood lumber industry would be feasible.A pipeline is simply a set of tools used in the workflow of data analysis to provide us with a clear picture of the data we have collected.This is what we are aiming to do with this year s project.Our project will characterize the microbiomes from the North American Porcupines found in Nova Scotia forests and attempt to "mine" the microbiome for useful enzymes.The adapter addition is important because it introduces specificity in that only DNA containing the adapter will be sequenced.The environmental DNA extraction provides us with DNA from the organisms in the microbiomes of each of the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park mammals.Thus, the gut microbiome of the North American porcupine seems like a logical starting point for our search of a microbiome to mine.Our project is designed in three stages.Analysis of the genomic DNA mixture provides us with biological information such as the identities of the organisms present and the major functions of the microbiomes.In the case of PICRUSt, the OTU picking is done against the GreenGene database, and that database is then used to predict gene familes from the metagenomes associated with that database.The PICRUSt algorithm works in two steps.The sequence information can then be used to determine what bacteria are found in the sample.Illumina sequencing provides a massive amount of data that must then be sifted through with the aid of computer programs.Examples of these can be seen below, and these charts from our fecal sample analysis can be found here After taxonomic assignment, a tool called Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was used to determine functionality of OTU\x92s within the microbiome of each animal.Because this is a particularly daunting task for even a strong computer, this step is only done once and the output is provided for the next step.This metagenome inference is done by comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequence to known sequences and makes conclusions on the identity of each sequence\x92s evolutionary relative.The terpenes often found in pine tree resin are known to exhibit anti-microbial properties -- this could be an issue if we try to utilize bacteria to break down softwood lumber, for example.The terpenes in pine tree resin have high boiling points (150C - 200C), and simply distilling them would cause decomposition of the terpenes into other compounds.After many cycles, we have exponential amplification of the segment of DNA that is flanked by the oligonucleotide primers.After collecting the distillate from this procedure (which is actually a mixture of clear water with a thin film of terpenic extract floating on top), the organic layer is extracted out and used for analysis!Abubucker, S., Segata, N., Goll J., Schubert, A. M., Izard, J., Cantarel, B. L., et al.Alkaline lysis works through a detergent, which disrupts the membranes of the bacterial cells.A discrete portion of the 16S rRNA gene from each of the three microbes was amplified using pcr.Although we didn\x92t get too far with the library, we did make some changes to the protocol to make the construction procedure more efficient.We were originally interested in developing the metagenomic library as it would provide the ability to assess and exploit the whole microbial genomic composition found in our environmental sample.If half of the sequence matches a region from one genome, while the second half of the sequence matches a region from the genome of a different organism, the program knows that the sequence is chimeric and not a biologically distinct sequence.Next, the non-chimeric, paired and filtered reads are matched against a database.QIIME uses PEAR (Paired-End reAd mergeR) to do this.The next step is to use a statistics tool called fastQC, which provides us with information of the read quality and length from the paired reads created in the PEAR step.*; Caporaso, J. G.; McDonald, D.; Knights, D.; a Reyes, J.; Clemente, J. C.; Burkepile, D. E.; Vega Thurber, R. L.; Knight, R.; Beiko, R. G.; and Huttenhower, C. Predictive functional profiling of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences.PICRUSt infers the gene content of the organisms present in the OTU picking output by comparing them to their sequenced evolutionary relatives.Each colony that grows can be used to study a specific fragment of DNA from the environmental sample.Examination of the DNA in the metagenomic library.The DNA inserted into the model organism will contain genes which will code for enzymes.These fecal samples contain millions of each animal\x92s gut microbes, which make up the microbiomes of their gut.First: we hope to isolate and characterize the microbiomes of many animals found at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park.We used chloroform extraction to isolate large pieces of DNA from the porcupine fecal sample.Manipulation of the DNA.Because the 16S region of the bacterial and archaeal genomes are conserved, they often contain some level of sequence similarity.Terpenes are insoluble in water, and a mixture of the two (with far more water than terpenes) will boil at a temperature slightly lower than 100C.Through de-novo OTU picking, the program does not throw out 16S data.This is problematic because we d be left with the following question: are we testing the inhibition of pine tree resin terpenes, or the products of terpene decomposition?Although we DID use conventional distillation and obtained a terpenic extract, we also applied a "softer" distillation method to avoid potential decomposition.The specific region we require for microbial identification is the 16S rRNA gene.A microbiome is the collection of microbes found in and on larger organisms.Because they eat a supplemented diet, and diet does affect microbiome content, there is potential error associated with the use of samples obtained from the Park.We did not get to the metagenomic library this year, but a quick description of it is given here.Cellulose-degrading bacteria were isolated on cellulose medium (see protocol page for medium recipe) which contained ground Whatman paper acting as the cellulose source.That being said, we did begin the construction of the library with the help from the Waterloo iGEM team who provided the pJC8 cosmid, to be used as the vector for our library construction.Metagenomics can provide insight into enzymatic pathways, evolutionary profiles, and microbial function.Metagenomics provides the chance to search through the incredible biodiversity found in the environment without having to conform the sample to fit within standard laboratory techniques.The Park was also the safest way for us to obtain fecal samples, so associated error was acknowledged as part of this process.We obtained fecal samples from 21 mammals at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park.Shubenacadie Wildlife Park Microbiome Survey | Metagenomic Library and Isolation | Chemical AnalysisCellulolytic enzymes have become a very interesting field of research for the potential production of microbial biofuels.This step is extended to organisms that are part of the living relatives group, but are still unknown because they have not been studied.The bound PCR products are sequenced through the addition of fluorescently labelled deoxy-ribonucleotides that glow when they are incorporated into the DNA molecule.It is more inclusive because any 16S sequence not matched to a reference database in open and closed OTU picking are thrown out.Our chemical analysis section allowed us to look into this and ensure we won t have any more problems down the road.Bacteria have already established their role in industry, and their applicability in the industrial sector has been growing rapidly.After receiving fecal samples from Shubenacadie Wildlife Park, the team plated the samples on the cellulose medium.The annealing step allows the oligonucleotide primers to bind to the single-stranded molecules at their complementary sequence.The database matching step picks operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are represented by distinct 16S gene sequences, and compares them to a database to be taxonomically identified.Otherwise, matches will not correspond to the precomputed reference database and PICRUSt will be unable to complete the second step.The second step is metagenome inference.This allows for the insertion of DNA into the cell followed by its maintenance and the stable production of plasmid-encoded proteins.These colonies were then streak purified on LB medium.We managed to isolate bacteria capable of growing on the cellulose medium.The transformed cells are then grown on selective medium and only cells that contain the vector will survive and form colonies (because of the antibiotic resistance segment in the vector).However, we considered this error to be minimized as the mammals eat many of the same things they would in nature.For the initial round of porcupine fecal samples, we made duplicates of every plate so that we could incubate in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.This happens hundreds of thousands of times in a massively parallel process to sequence all of the amplified DNA from our PCR amplification step.De-novo OTU picking matches 16S sequences together into OTUs without the use of any reference database; Open OTU picking matches 16S sequences to an open-sourced database like BLAST; and Closed OTU picking matches 16S sequences to a closed database like GreenGenes.fastQC also has scripts for this process.Following filtering of the reads, chimeric reads must be removed.Producing biofuel from things like leftover vegetables, lumber industry by-products and waste, seaweed and other easily obtainable sources could provide an answer to the ever-growing problem of energy production.The Softwood Lumber industry is particularly pertinent for Nova Scotia.The softwood lumber industry in Nova Scotia also harvested roughly 29,000 hectares of forest for the creation of softwood products.The vector is often introduced into the model organism, Escherichia coli, through a process called transformation.It is important that the sample collected represents the entirety of the environment being examined.It can then use the host cell macromolecular synthesis machinery to produce proteins encoded by the foreign genetic material.Interestingly, the North American Porcupine eats mostly bark and wood from trees found in Nova Scotia.This is why OTU picking from QIIME taxonomy assignments must be done to a closed reference database.Metagenomics, in comparison to phytogenic surveys, does more than look at the diversity of one gene (ex.Arctic Ocean Microbial Community Structure before and after the 2007 Record Sea Ice Minimum.HUMAnN: The HMP unified metabolic analysis network.Imagine taking these useless by-products and turning them into a sustainable form of energy like an ethanol biofuel through a simple biological reactor using E. coli and enzymes harvested from cellulose-degrading bacteria.The research in this area is new, but we are learning more and more of the importance of a healthy gut microbiome.The animals are fed a supplemented diet, which consists mainly of natural diets with added food like fruits/veggies for the herbivores and protein supplements for the carnivores.Mechanical lysis works through small ceramic beads shaken in the tube at high speeds to mechanically break up bacterial membranes and release the bacterial cell contents.The metagenomic library is our future goal for this project, which will enable us to screen for useful enzymes in biofuel production from our fecal sample bacteria.PCR works by using small oligonucleotides that are called primers, and a heat-stable DNA polymerase.The method we used is de-novo OTU picking, which does not use a reference database for OTU picking, and then compares the OTU\x92s to a database for identification.However, as other areas of the research began to erupt in exciting results, the library got put on the back burner.The broken bacterial cell debris is discarded and a supernate is passed through a column, where DNA binds but all other cell material flows through.To get access to this sequence information we used Illumina MiSeq.The illumina sequencer works on a principle called sequence-by-synthesis.A vector is a DNA molecule that can carry foreign genetic material into another cell.Our work is definitely inspired with this in mind, but if we want to generate a strain that operates anywhere near pine tree resin, there is a caveat which must first be investigated.Pine tree resin contains (amongst many other things) a mixture of terpenes.The PICRUSt algorithm therefore precomputes the gene content of all known organisms in a reference database.The medium was used by a research group in India who were conducting very similar experiments, and they had had great success in isolating cellulose-degrading bacteria.This is done by estimating the unknown living relatives  gene content through their 16S sequence similarity to studied and sequenced organisms.PICRUSt works by predicting the gene families contained inside a bacterial or archaeal metagenome identified using 16S bacteria or archaeal sequencing.The illumina sequencer records each of these flashes of coloured light and is able to interpret this information to provide a DNA sequence.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'We also built a Microbiome Map of Shubenacadie Wildlife Park, which took sequencing results from our project and incorporated them into an interactive tool

'protocol': '', 'result': 'Next year we intend to move forward with the metagenomic library and isolate more enzymes that would be useful for converting soft-wood lumber waste to a source of efficient fuel (ethanol) or be useful for bioremediation.Using the cellulose media, we plated porcupine fecal samples to inspect which species could be cultivated and would degrade cellulose.It can be seen in figure 3 that the transketolase enzyme and the starch phosphorylase enzyme are found with higher proportion in the arctic wolf and coyote samples than in the beaver and porcupine samples.This information provides some evidence that our future metagenomic library will be a fruitful endeavour.It can be noticed that the beaver and porcupine microbiomes have significantly higher proportions of these cellulose degrading enzymes than the arctic wolf or coyote microbiomes.We also did a second analysis looking at enzymes found at a higher proportion in the arctic wolf and coyote.For bioremediation, however, a different species of bacteria should be used to screen the metagenomic library (because E. coli can survive terpenes).All of the above results, for both E. coli and S. cerevisiae are summarized in Figure 4 below.This year we had a bit of time to perfect the metagenomic library protocol.We were able to grow many colonies on the cellulose media plates, showing us that there are many cellulose bacteria in the porcupine gut.The colony PCR that was done with the cellulose-degrading colonies can be seen on the gel to the left.They came from the porcupine fecal sample, on two separate cellulose plates grown aerobically at 37 degrees celcius.Other colony PCR experiments were done on three different colony morphologies found on the porcupine fecal sample cellulose plate: white colonies, yellow colonies and red bulls-eye colonies.Making a beaver microbiome metagenomic library should yield plenty of useful cellulose-degrading enzymes.We found that the commercial stuff contained mostly D-Limonene, as well as a variety of other terpenes (with alpha-pinene being present in very trace amounts).We also created a couple of new biobricks containing enzymes that we identified bioinformatically from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, a cellulose degrader identified in the porcupine microbiome.A series of culturing tubes were innoculated with E. coli and varying amounts of the terpenic extract were added; we started at a concentration of 4.3 mg/mL and worked our way down, and then measured turbidity -- and found no inhibition.We should be able to screen this library for cellulose degrading enzymes as well as terpene degrading enzymes that could prove useful in our search for new biofuel feedstocks and production solutionsWe have been able to provide evidence that a metagenomic library from DNA extracted from porcupine fecal samples would provide us with a new source of cellulose degrading enzymes.We therefore conclude that E. coli is very resistant to the anti-microbial properties of pine tree resin, and that the terpenes would not interfere with our goals for cellulose degradation.In comparison, the terpenic extract contained mostly alpha-pinene and beta-pinene in a 3:1 ratio.We tested for bacterial inhibition first by simply culturing E. coli on solid media with a dab of pine tree resin in the center.We showed that growth of an E. coli strain used to degrade soft-wood lumber waste would not be inhibited by the anti-microbial properties of terpenes found in trees milled for softwood lumber.We expected we would find a zone of inhibition, but did not observe such a thing.After isolating the terpenic extract from the resin, we repeated similar experiments by soaking into Whatman filter paper and placing it in the culturing plate.This can be seen in B of figure 1 below.We did a PICRUSt analysis on this 16S data from 4 animals in the park whose microbiomes we re-sequenced.The next step would be to actually attempt the metagenomic library and search for the enzymes we have been able to identify bioinformatically.With the brown streak pattern and the lactose fermenting we labelled this bacterium as likely a Sphingomonas sp.The high-throughput sequencing part of our project was done mostly to provide evidence for the feasibility of creating a metagenomic library from microbiome DNA.With this new protocol we believe that we will be able to build the metagenomic library using DNA Extracted from porcupine fecal sample and transforming that library into E. coli.We also did an extensive proof of concept for our plan to use microbiomes as a "mine" for enzymes and gathered evidence that it would, likely, enable us to identify genes that encode cellulose degrading enzymes.After 16S sequencing the yellow colony was identified as Escherichia coli and the red bulls-eye colony was identified as Stenotrophomonas rhizophila.These resequenced samples included the beaver, the porcupine, the arctic wolf and the coyote.The results are documented in detail on our Proof of Concept page.We were able to sequence the microbiomes of 21 mammals from the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park with the help of the Integrated Microbiome Resource at Dalhousie University.We found that the microbiomes of animals that are of similar families, or are closely related evolutionarily, correlate with the similarity of their microbiomes.The sequencing of the white colony morphology proved challenging.', 'safety': 'Because of this, we had many resources for maintaining our health and safety such as Dalhousie\x92s Biosafety

happening we sent the pVeg DNA along with the primers that we were using to see what was being amplified.7/15/15 - While waiting for the sequencing results we decided to move forward with the B. subtilis transformation.The same PIPE procedure was conducted using this new DNA.9/1/15 - Studied plates from PIPE transformation of both CFA and GFP downstream of the pLac promoter and saw isolated colonies.We focused on either trying to actively transport the protons out of the cell or quenching them in the cytosol using amino acid decarboxylases.7/1/15 - Based on these two systems we began planning out the experiments we would have to run to begin standardizing procedures to then use to test our acid resistance system while we continue to plan out exactly what that system is.Miniprep was conducted on the overnights generated from the PIPE colonies, but after digestion and visualization, it was clear that we had not inserted the CFA gene into the vector.So we ran the PCR at fewer cycles in order to see if those last 5 cycles were causing the cells to fix the sequence as if there was a final elongation step.9/14/15 - Observed plates from the three different transformations attempting to build CFA synthase gene downstream of the pLac promoter.This time we ran a background of only vector to account for the amount of perceived colonies that were just the result of re-ligation of the vector.9/5/15 - The plates from the transformation showed 2 colonies on both the background plate and on the recombinant plate, indicating that we did not get recombinants.The hypothesis appeared to be right because we saw much stronger bands from the this round of PCR.9/4/15 - DpnI digestion/ligation of the PIPE PCR products were conducted and then transformed into NEB 5 alpha cells.The pieces were then ligated together at a 1:2 molar ratio and transformed into NEB 5 alpha cells.8/6/15 - No colonies were observed on any of the plates indicating an unsuccessful transformation.Based on that sequence we then designed and ordered primers to use PIPE cloning to insert GFP into the pVeg vector.CFA and GFP insert digests were gel extracted and ligated downstream of the constitutive promoter using the same spectrum of vector to insert ratios used previously.All of the restriction enzymes, ligase, gel extraction, and genome extraction kits were ordered.7/24/15 - Starvation transformation was conducted again using the overnights and disposable flasks.7/25/15 - Still no colonies from the transformation.A gel was also run on the PCR products that were used for PIPE the day before.So we reran the DpnI digestion/ligation step of PIPE with the cleaned PCR products from before but with the previously used spectrum of vector to insert ratios.They were then transformed.8/31/15 - We reran the PCR on the pLac vector and this time saw much larger bands.We also weren\x92t sure if the annealing temperature was too high for adequate binding so we ran the second PCR on a gradient.We opted to use the starvation method to induce the natural competence in B. subtilis and transform.7/6/15 - Resuspended both pVeg and GFP BioBricks and then transformed them into Top10 competent cells.7/7/15 - Colonies were observed on plates so the colonies were picked to make overnights.The conclusion was that the DNA was exposed to the UV for too long and so we decided to run another gel using the restriction digests from before.We also have been consistently getting weak bands from our vector PCRs so we are going to try running them temperatures, as opposed to the standard 72°C9/3/15 - PCRs were run passed on the troubleshooting from the day before.Even though the bands were the right size, we decided to change the restriction digest run time to see if that would help.We tried 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10 vector to insert then ligated and transformed.8/8/15 - No colonies were observed showing that the transformation was unsuccessful yet again.The DNA was then transformed.9/12/15 - Observed no colonies on the plates from the PIPE transformations.Colonies were picked for colony PCR using primers that lie outside of the prefix and suffix.The gel then revealed that we had a slight band in the right position.We picked the pAraC vector so that we could induce transcription with arabinose separately from inducing expression of CFA with IPTG.9/8/15 - Colonies were observed from the pAraC transformation.The gel showed large bands for CFA, SAM and the pLac vector but the pAraC vector still wouldn\x92t amplify.The transformation was run with the pVeg plasmid as that will be the vector that the construct will be inside of.7/18/15 - Plates from the transformation yielded no colonies indicating a failed transformation.No colonies from the OEC transformation or from the PIPE products run at 35 cycles.Ran a colony PCR on the colony but the gel showed no amplicon indicating a failed PCR rather than a failed transformation.It was anticipated that maybe the procedure run time was much longer than it was supposed to be so we thought that maybe that was the issue because all of the OD readings matched the documented procedure\x92s estimations.PCRs were run on the genome using these primers.Entertained diverse ideas from creating a pH sensing bacterium to use as a drug delivery system to fight cancer to using an enterobacterium that would function as a probiotic to try and suppress the Celiac\x92s disease response to gluten.5/9/15 - Decided that focusing on in vivo projects isn\x92t a good avenue for us to study because of the practical hurdles associated with trying to get an organism to live within the body and then to get that passed by the FDA.We were running low on mini prep reagents and so we only picked four colonies and so we picked more to see if maybe we just grabbed ones with religated vectors like those we saw on the background plate.We knew we didn\x92t have time to order new primers, but scarless cloning procedures use similar primers so we kept with the ones that we had.Primers were designed and ordered.7/17/15 - The overnight cultures were used to run the starvation transformation protocol.Colonies were picked to generate overnights.8/14/15 - A genome extraction was preformed on the overnights.Primers were resuspended and used in PCRs with the GFP and pLac BioBricks along with the genomic DNA for CFA.The only other step that we though could possibly be causing issues was the gel extraction step.To remedy this issue we redesigned the primers to have a higher Tm and made sure that the Tm\x92s of the primer pair were closer together to ensure that we are getting the proper binding of both at the same annealing temperature.The resulting DNA was transformed.8/21/15 - No colonies were observed on the plates.After that was run it was run on a gel and still yielded no bands.7/22/15 - We ran another B. subtilis starvation transformation using the, hopefully, detergent-free glassware and neutral deionized water.Our hope was to try and take several pivotal proteins from the complex and insert them into a high expression vector to see if by increasing the production of these proteins, we could increase the cellulolytic activity of the organism being used in the bioreactor.6/16/15 - Studied the actual workings of the fermentors at Anaerobe systems to see what problems were actually present.The only possibility that we could come up with was that we still were not successfully ridding the glassware of the detergents.We thought about trying to create an organism that would maybe aid in the production of T and B-cells.5/14/15 - Decided that we didn\x92t have the proper resources to adequately test anything related to cancer research so we shifted gears.Digestion, ligation, and transformation were conducted on these segments into both NEB 5 alpha cells and T7 competent cells.9/16/15 - Gibson assembly transformations were successful from all three primer sets constructed for the integration of CFA downstream of the pLac promoter.1st round of PCR did not generate any bands on the agarose gel.A gel was run to verify that the OEC procedure was not successful.During this time we were also running a control acid shock assay to test the response of the untransformed T7 cells that we will be testing.9/13/15 - Began by rerunning the PCRs from the previous day and for some reason it worked this time.A plate was streaked out from the glycerol stock of the B. subtilis 168.7/16/15 - Colonies were picked from the streak plate of B. sub 168 to make overnights to seed the cultures for the transformation.These products were then transformed and plated.8/18/15 - Still no recombinants could be seen from the transformation.Thinking that we have changed all of the parameters that we could, we suspected that maybe there was an issue with the constitutive promoter sequence that was leading to neither of them working.The knew that the problem had to be embedded in the ligation step because we were getting clear amplification of the inserts and vectors and we have standardized our transformation protocol, so that leaves the ligation.Primers pairs were designed to amplify both the CFA and GFP inserts as well as to open up the pLac promoter.Overnights were still made from the colonies to be screened the next day.Based on all of the literature that we read on the PIPE method and primer design we couldn\x92t find the issue.Materials were prepped again for the next day.7/20/15 - No colonies were once again observed on the plates.In order to address this issue we decided to create a two part project: one side will sense low pH which would then induce the expression of the other side which is the regulating system that would be responsible for returning the intracellular pH to neutral.6/26/15 - We met to discuss our findings related to the sensing and regulating systems utilized in nature.After burning so many days on the PIPE method we decided that it would be better to switch to the traditional scar cloning method.7/23/15 - Yet again the transformation didn\x92t work.To fix this we decided to use disposable culture flasks that have never been exposed to detergents to ensure that is not the problem.We saw proper amplification of the GFP insert DNA but only saw a band that represented a substantially smaller segment than what was supposed to be there.Both PCRs of the inserts worked but the vectors were unsuccessful.9/10/15 - Transformation plates were checked but only one colony was observed.Primers also came in.7/21/15 - Overnights were created from the B. subtilis 168 plate.None of us were familiar with the cellulolytic pathways so we went and did more research.6/10/15 - Met up to discuss everyone\x92s findings.Also miniprepped the overnight cultures made from the CFA and SAM genes inserted into the pSB1C3 vector to be sent into iGEM.DNA was sent to Sequetech for sequencing.9/15/15 - Observed colonies from the site-directed mutagenesis tranformation.We decided to use B. subtilis as our chassis because it shares close homology with Clostridia, which is the organism we aim to implement the system in.Another promoter, BBa_J04500, was resuspended and transformed along with BBa_R0040, BBa_B0015, and BBa_B0034.8/20/15 - DNA was extracted from the overnights and glycerol stocks were made.The gel revealed that CFA and SAM were successfully built into the vectors.We once again saw the proper amplification of the GFP insert but no amplification of pVeg.We hypothesized that it could have been the detergent residue left in the glassware that was causing the cells to not take up the DNA.The same spectrum of vector to insert ratios was used in the ligation.It was predicted that there was not a large enough concentration of mega-primer for the second PCR which would cause little binding to the template DNA.We found that the rate of activity of the organism was not the problem because they were using a cellulolytic Clostridium species, which has a doubling time of about 6 minutes.This indicated off target binding somewhere else in the vector.7/14/15 - Another round of PCR was run on both of the sequences to try and isolate the issue with the pVeg amplification.The 30 cycle PCR products yielded ~50 colonies on the concentrated plate with only 7 on the background plate.SAM was produced on the second and then nothing again in the third one of just CFA.We found that the exact mechanism for this degradation is still not well understood as it requires the use of a cellulosome, which is a conglomerate of numerous large proteins that has yet to be fully visualized.The product was then digested based on the standard assembly, as GFP was previously.We reran the digests based on the same protocol as before but this time used a spectrum of molar ratios.Only two bands were seen in the gel showing that the PstI site had been destroyed.To fix this issue we changed around our gel extraction protocol so that each lane was precut out of the gel so that only the band being cut would be exposed to the UV opposed to all of them being exposed.We chose to do it in the first place because of its close homology to Clostridia, but all we really need at the moment is to show some increase in acid resistance.It was found that the primer was preferentially binding to another site in the vector.DNA was then sent out for sequencing to verify the sequence posted on the Registry.7/10/15 - Sequences came back matching the anticipated sequences.We anticipate that the problem was with the molar ratio of vector to insert.There was no discrepancies between the sequences.Received the B. subtilis in the mail.We also ran a Gibson assembly utilizing the PCR products generated by the product of the 35 cycles of PCR generated through OEC.Primers were designed to flank the CFA synthase gene with overhangs that matched the sequence of the prefix and suffix.8/17/15 - Received primers in the mail.We saw this competition as a driving force to construct more parts to expand the registry rather than to create a stand alone project, so creating a pH sensing system could prove useful in other applications.5/16/15 - After more investigation we found that other pH sensors had been submitted to the Registry in the past but none were directly linked to transcription factors.We decided to revisit the primer design of the overhangs being used to see if that is where the problem lied.This could happen for a myriad of reasons but it is likely that the polymerase is going back and filling in the overhangs making it impossible to ligate.Ran three different PCRs replicating the PCRs that were conducted the day before but for some reason no amplicon was produced on the first round.We made an overnight from the colony to miniprep and analyze the next day.The cycles were maintained as well as the template DNA.The rest then went back to the pH sensing system.With the cloning process taking as long as it is, we moved to trying to extract our regulator gene CFA.To do this we had to figure out how to transform B. subtilis and what we were going to transform with.7/4/15 - Decided to use the pVeg promoter BioBrick as our test, constitutive promoter and then using GFP as our reporter gene.The hypothesis then turned to ligation time.8/10/15 - Restriction digests were preformed based on the prior specifications.The GFP plasmid was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and the constitutive promoter was digested with EcoRI and XbaI.We suspected that this was due to the annealing temperature being too high for proper binding.We hypothesized this to be the result of the high acid concentration in the culture that accumulated over the time of the culture.Some of us revisited the Celiac\x92s disease idea and tried finding a site in the recognition of gluten in an attempt to find a spot to repress the response.Sequence data for the pSB1C3+CFA and pSB1C3+SAM came in and was analyzed in comparison to the anticipated sequence.One integrated a 6bp spacer between the RBS and ORF, while the other did not.We requested a streak plate of E. coli K-12 from the Steven\x92s lab on the SCU campus to extract the DNA from.8/13/15 - Plate was received from the Steven\x92s lab.~150 LB/LB+CAM plates were poured in preparation for the acid shock trials.An overnight culture was made from it into LB.7/11/15 - We successfully cultured up B. subtilis so we took a small aliquot to make a glycerol stock.7/13/15 - Primers arrived and PCRs were run.', 'protocol': 'At faster speeds the resolution of the bands of DNA decreases.Protocol adapted from \x93A Practical Comparison of Ligation-Independent Cloning Techniques\x94 by Julian Stevenson, James R. Krycer, Lisa Phan, Andrew J.

Coli.Cultures were induced at 60, 30, 15 minutes before, and at acid shock with 1mM IPTG.In Figure 2 there is an inverse correlation in the OD readings at stationary phase and the levels of acidity, as in the more acid the lower the OD.', 'safety': 'The Environment, Health and Safety Department work to:To learn about the EHS Department at Santa Clara University please visit their website.The Environment Health and Safety Department\x92s (EHS) mission is to:"support and advance the teaching, learning and research activities of the University through promotion of a safe and healthy campus environment by providing and coordinating programs and services that minimize safety, health, environmental and regulatory risks to the SCU community.', 'keywords': 'U n k n o w n', 'track': 'Manufacturing', 'part_favorite': '', 'part_normal': 'BBa_K1869000\nBBa_K1869001\nBBa_K1869002', 'theme': '134', 'hits': 0}}, {'_index': 'team_wiki', '_type': 'wiki', '_id': 'AV3_VMF8r5lUclF2BU5s', '_score': 1.9262319, '_source': {'year': '2016', 'team_name': 'Gifu', 'attribution': 'Promega supported us by offering reagent financial aid.Echizen city supported us by offering reagent financial aid.iGEM Gifu 2015&2014 members: They advised us all of iGEM.We appreciate all of laboratories and other professors offering us great environment for our works.Cosmo-bio supported us by offering financial aid.This laboratory\x92s member advised us the method of our experiments and how to proceeding our project.President Moriwaki & Gifu university: They supported us mentally and financially.Sponsors: We supported by some sponsors.He took us to our survey area and accompanies us for Giant Jamboree.Professor T.

following way.We can conclude that the uricase mixture made with our engineered E. coli has an ability to process uric acid with theoretically maximum rate of 3.1ng/(?L*min).Accoding to our modeling, a large amount of Uricase may be needed to solve the problem of birds\x92 dropping.We couldn\x92t confirm this enzyme catalyzes uric acid into allantoin.The growth ability of the recombinant E. coli in minimal media containing uric acidGrowth test in minimal media of wild type E. coli and the recombinant E. coli were conducted to confirm Uricase activity which was expressed by the recombinant E. coli.In SDS-PAGE experiment, there is a high possibility that Uricase of B. subtilis was synthesized by the recombinant E. coli.The strongest band of lane 6 (less than 31 kDa) was not thought as uricase because of the difference from correct molecular weight (38.7 kDa).In addition, we tried?the purification by His-tag, only to fail (no purification product was seen) because that uricase from B. subtilis hardly dissolve in PBS buffer we used (shown above Figure)E. coli culuture were grown in the presence of IPTG.The result is shown in Figure.16 Even though the activity is lower than reagent Uricase, the activity of Uricase which expressed by our recombinant E. coli can be detected.In this project, we assayed mainly device BBa_ K2158004.However, in the growth test, the recombinant E. coli didn\x92t grow well with uric acid.In determination of the recombinant Uricase, the result shows the possibility of expressed functional protein catalyze uric acid to allantoin.Then we put the proportionality constant as Kcat.Here, we estimated the two kinetic parameters Vmax and Km in the equation by fitting these parameters to a measurement result of the concentration change of uric acid in the reaction mixture.We performed growth test in minimal media containing purines of E. coli, B. subtilis, S.cerevisiae to confirm the existence of the target gene.The blue curve means the fitted curve, and the red plots is the data obtained from the experiment.The concentration of uricase as a standard reagent wasNow two kinetic parameters which is independent of concentration of enzyme or substrate (Kcat and Km) were estimated.Second, we conducted His-Link purification of protein and measured the absorbance at 280.0 nm to determine the concentration of uricase in the cell lysate.After that, we degraded urea and assayed the releasing ammonia by the method mentioned above.The growth tests in minimal media containing purines of B. subtilis , S. cerevisiae were performed.We attached the source code of this fitting tool below.In the following data and description, the unit of concentration of any substances is ng/?L and the unit of time is minute.First, we measured the change of concentration of uric acid in the reaction mixture.To acheive this goal, we manufactured E. coli that synthesizes uricase, which catalyzes uric acid to urea.In addition, we measured Uricase activity and concluded that there was a possibility that the synthesized Uricase has activity.However, Candida utilis has the gene coded uricase which has high enzyme activity.)Vmax is the conversion rate of uric acid under the condition that the ratio of the amount of uric acid to that of uricase is sufficiently high.E. coli culture was sonicated and diluted 1 to 100 times with the borate buffer.We could\x92t understand why this incident happened.Determination of recombinant Uricase in the supernatant and the precipitationIn Figure.12, we considered that expressed Uricase is mainly in the precipitation.Yasuji Koyama, Toshio Ichikawa, Eiichi Nakano (1996) Cloning, Sequence Analysis, and Expression in Escherichia coli of the Gene Encoding the Candida utilis Urate Oxidase (Uricase).So, we cloned genes of uricase, allantoinase and allantoicase into E. coli to assess production and activity of these three enzymes.For this reason, the conversion rate of uric acid is described with the Michaelis-Menten equation.But we found that only Uricase derived from B. subtilis was in the recombinant E. coli .We performed PCR amplification of the genes coding these enzymes and cloned into E. coli.Uricase in this solution was synthesized by E. coli which we engineered.Uric acid in the reaction mixture may be catalyzed into allantoin.We combined Figure.13 and Figure.15.B. subtilis can degrade all of five intermediates of uric degradation described above.According to James and Rudolf(1984), wild type S. pombe is capable of degrading uric acid and allantoin.The result of the measurement is summerized in , Table.1 and Figure.11 .Then, we inputted these data into the parameter fitting tool mentioned above.So, we assayed Uricase in the supernatant and the precipitation of the sonicated cell suspension respectively and tried to verify the activity of the Uricase.Therefore, we are interested in "How fast can our E. coli process uric acid theoretically?"So, it is not clear that this protein has the function.We can utilize expressed enzymes without sonication.Schulz AC,Nygaard P,Saxild HH(2001)Functional analysis of 14 genes that constitute the purine catabolic

were continuously measured.E. coli has a gene of allantoinase, and we can consider the possibility of affecting assay.(Protocols)The result of absorbance change is shown in Fig.15.We think IPTG didn\x92t control lactose operon efficiently and the amount of the expressed enzyme was not enough to grow in the medium.We could extract genome from three kinds of bacteria, B. subtilis, S.cerevisiae and S. pombe and express three enzymes mentioned above.Meanwhile, this year\x92s result is not enough to solve the pollution of droppings.In the city, deterioration of the landscape caused by birds\x92 droppings is also a serious problem.Our goal of this project is to solve problems caused by birds\x92 droppings with genetically engineered E. coli.Thirdly, each gene is cloned into B. subtilis instead of E. coli .So, we plan to solve these problems by expression of birds\x92 "dropping cleanerase" and degrading uric acid.Purine metabolism is a pathway of synthesizing and degrading purines.If we use the gene coded uricase of Candida utilis by total synthesis, our project will improve more.Ammonia, the final product of purine metabolism, is the most assimilated nitrogen source of most fungi and bacteria.According to the sequence data, deletion of one base happened and it changed the reading frame in this composite part.Output of the parameter fitting was as follows.Besides, this graph shows the result of parameter fitting.As template genes of Uricase, Allantoinase and Allantoicase, we used four microorganisms.These crude extractions were diluted 1 to 100 times with the borate buffer.Ukai is a traditional night fishing method in which an "usho"(Cormorant Fishing Master) and "u"(cormorant birds) work together to fish by the flames of Kagari-bi (fishing fire lanterns) reflecting on the dark surface of the river, with Mt Kinka and lofty Gifu Castle on its summit providing a dramatic backdrop to the scenery.Furthermore, E. coli has a special anaerobic pathway to decompose allantoin into urea.The final concentration of the enzyme is 0.417 ng/?L.However, BBa_B0015 was not included in the plasmid.As expected, Bacillus subtilis grew well with uric acid, allantoin and ammonium sulfate.Uricase was cloned from B. subtilis and S. pombe.In Gifu prefecture, Cormorant Fishing on the Nagara river (Ukai) is one of the most summer sights in Japan.B. subtilis has eight genes driving uric acid degradation.However, it didn\x92t grow well with w/o ammonium, uric acid and ammonium sulfate.0.5 mL of distilled water was added and the mixture was preheated at 25?.Cormorant is carnivorous animal, and the amount of uric acid in their droppings are larger than that of uric acid in other birds\x92 droppings.We prepared 0.001% uric acid solution by dissolving in 50.0 mmol/L borate buffer containing 1.0 mmol/L EDTA and detergent(pH8.5).On the other hand, damage caused by the cormorant droppings at the riverside is serious in Japan.We assayed the degradation of uric acid by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 290 nm.In kegg pathway of purine metabolism in E. coli, it has HIU hydrolase and Allantoinase.We added 0.125 mg of urease in the reaction mixture.Birds\x92 excrement consists mainly of uric acid which is hardly soluble material.No significant differences were observed in minimal media with 2 mM uric acid and w/o ammonium.Minimal media containing 2 mM urate or allantoin or ammonium sulfate as a sole nitrogen source and minimal media not containing nitrogen sources were also prepared.Firstly, we have to do more accurate assay using the allantoinase-loss-strain of E. coli.Cell suspensions were incubated at the appropriate temperatures for one day and spotted onto LB broth or YPD broth.A tool which estimates and outputs Vmax and Km by entering the measurement results of the concentration change was developed.E. coli culture was sonicated to assay the enzyme.The equation we made is as follows.d [uric acid] / dt = - Vmax * [uric acid] / (Km + [Uric acid])\x85(A)([X] represents the concentration of a substance X.In woods on the riverside inhabited by cormorant, some leaves are stained with their droppings and interfered with photosynthesis.James R. Kinghorn, Rudolf Fluri (1984) Genetic studies of purine breakdown in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.So, we used B. subtilis and S. pombe in place of that.We couldn\x92t verify the difference between E. coli with device BBa_K2158003 and wild type E. coli.So, we concluded the expressed Allantoicase didn t have appropriate function to degrade allantoic acid.Enzyme solution was mixed with buffer for allantoinase(50.0 mM Hepes, pH 7.75) containing 45.0 mM allantoin and incubated at 37?.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'After the presentation, we conducted a field survey to check the circumstances of birds\x92 droppings in Echizen city.The purpose of the questionnaires was to investigate how the High School students recognized about genetic recombination technology and synthesize biology.Furthermore, as a result of the after survey, there were many favorable opinions that they accept convenience and universality of the medicine using genetic recombination technology and synthesize biology.As a result of before survey Q1, Q2 and Q3, the recognition of the genetic recombination technology was very high, but the recognition of the synthesize biology was very low.In addition, when we compared the result of the before survey Q5 and the after survey Q4, we understood how students have impression of a product using the genetic recombination technology.In the field survey, we found some birds\x92 droppings under some utility poles, but we weren\x92t able to find the terribly polluted place.However, the city officer and local resident told that there were some polluted places and many wild birds in Echizen city few years ago.We were requested a presentation about the activity of iGEM Gifu by Ogakikita senior high school which is specified in the super global high school.At the lecture, many students asked about iGEM and genetic recombination technology.[shown in Project] \xa0We made presentation at Ogaki Higashi High School and the natural science club of Gifu Kita High School.Survey of the Droppings damage in Echizen city, Fukui prefecture\xa0In recent years, urbanization in Japan is advanced, so the environment has changed.The purpose was to get the recognition and understanding about genetic recombination technology and synthesize biology in the society.So, it is thought that the future problem in the study on synthesize biology is to prove the unknown risk, and to secure safety based on it.In the before survey, the favorable answer to food was 63%, cosmetics was 18% and medicine was 45%.However, in the after survey, the favorable answer to food was 50%, cosmetics was 18% and medicine was 83%.So, we thought that the season of our survey was not suitable.But, there were many opinions that they worry about safety for the food.We therefore made a presentation in Echizen city because we thought that our study could help to solve the problem.To give some basic background information, there are some places in Echizen city that are polluted due to birds\x92 droppings.We should conduct the survey, when the wild birds were active.Survey of the damage associated with birds in Gifu cityWe confirmed whether the dropping (uric acid) is decomposed by the constructed E. coli which has a gene coding uricase.So, we found that the impression of genetically modified food was not so good in the society.Therefore, it has been an increase in the Droppings damage in urban areas.And also, high school students presented their study.The following graphs are the results of the questionnaires.And high school students might get more

Dr. Lynn J. Rothschild, our team PI, evolutionary biologist and astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center, Adjunct Professor at Brown University (Molecular and Cellular Biology and Biochemistry) and at UC Santa Cruz (Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology); Dr. Jill Tarter, Bernard M. Oliver Chair for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Research at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California; and Dr. Alan Stern, former chief of all space and Earth science programs (2007-2008), current leader of NASA\x92s New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, and current Chief Scientist at World View Enterprises, a company developing high-altitude balloons for commercial use in research and private space exploration.We tend to assume that we\x92re working on an environmentally friendly technology, but would our method really be more environmentally friendly than growing latex in Southeast Asia?\x94 We started reaching out to people who might be able to help us answer these questions.First, we met with Dr. Anne Schauer-Gimenez of Mango Materials, whose company produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable plastic, by a novel method.Professor Lepech, whom we met through Stanford connections, had surprisingly led us back to NASA.Our team ultimately integrated our research into the design of our project by reinvesting in the idea of developing space materials that might be repurposed in years to come.I (Amy) asked him if he could help me predict, based on gross assumptions about the scale-up process, what we would need to run an industrial-scale latex bio-manufacturing facility and what price we might expect to set for our latex.(A side note: We also met with Dr. Stephen Comello, Associate Director of the Sustainable Energy Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, who encouraged us to reach out to major rubber manufacturing companies and ask them how our technology might impact their operations and marketing strategies.These materials would need to be thoroughly purified and separated from live cells before balloon construction.We would need to come up with atmospheric sensing and UV protection mechanisms that could operate in vitro and attach to a balloon membrane.The problem of how one might operate a Mars onsite synthetic biology lab and sterilize the resulting materials remains an area for future research.We have organized the \x93human practices\x94 elements of our research this summer into two categories, which follow from the two spaces in which our technology might be applied: outer space and Earth.)Figure 1: Members of the Stanford-Brown Team with Dr. Alan Stern These researchers conveyed to us the inestimable value of origin of life research on other planets.And in our meetings with the Stanford Space Initiative and with Dr. Alan Stern of World View, we attempted to better understand existing needs in space exploration that might be met by biomaterials.Without going through this process ourselves, it would be difficult to realistically project price, yield, and environmental impact of our latex manufacturing method.Only about 13% of US electricity comes from renewable energy sources.4 Second, the production and distribution channels for traditional manufacturing materials have become so efficient that it is nearly impossible for biomaterials to compete on price alone.This meeting also reinforced the message to our team that we will not be able to influence manufacturing practices unless we can sustainably sell latex at or below prevailing market prices.We next met with Murthy Konda and Binod Neupane of the Joint Bioenergy Institute (JBEI) Techno-economic Analysis Team to get advice about how to predict and assess the feasibility and sustainability of our latex production.We then determined our project categories:We would need to produce materials in bacteria that could be used for a balloon membrane.Though our materials could be produced in living organisms, the final balloon mechanisms would need to work in vitro.After reviewing these documents, we quickly realized that if we wanted to develop a practical tool for interplanetary life research, that tool would need to be completely devoid of life.Genentech uses a huge amount of water: judging by their 2015 corporate sustainability letter, their water usage is equivalent to that for roughly 10% of households in San Francisco County.23 Of course, Genentech has a massive facility that produces large amounts of pharmaceuticals, and based on my conversation with Mr. Davis, the same processes that ensure the purity (and safety) of pharmaceuticals seem to be some of the most water-intensive.The Mango Materials PHB will need to be price competitive with polyactic acid (PLA) and polypropylene in order to achieve goal impact, Dr. Schauer-Gimenez explained, because 80% of consumers care only about cost efficiency.In theory, the Mango Materials plastic should create a closed-loop cycle: methane fuels plastic production, the plastic releases methane upon degeneration, and the same net methane is used to produce more plastic.Dr. Schauer-Gimenez laughed: \x93Even our Berkeley friends who are environmentally conscious won\x92t pay $3 a pound for plastic!\x94 By the time our meeting was over, I had realized that investment in scale-up was not trivial.However, any potential benefit to this technology would be quickly negated if those tools were to contaminate the planet with Earth life.Developers of biotechnology for space research therefore need to go to great lengths to mitigate the risk of interplanetary contamination.Biological research tools (like our balloon) that could be developed onsite and thus eliminate transportation costs would, in theory, propel research forward.We spoke to several planetary scientists about the profound significance of responsible research on planets like Mars and Venus and on moons like Titan and Europa.In response, Professor Lepech pointed at my shirt: \x93Only about a dime was probably spent on transport for that.\x94) Because bio-manufacturing is so expensive and yields are so low, the market currently incentivizes bio-manufacturing of small, expensive products.They explained their strategy: the techno-economic analysis team sets a price point (or carbon emission) goal for an overall process, and then they develop a computational model to establish the thresholds that individual project teams must meet to achieve that goal.This research helps us better understand and appreciate our position in the universe.(Listen to the podcasts of our interviews with Dr. Rothschild, Professor Head and Dr. Tarter here.Pharmaceuticals are the perfect fit, as are expensive, complicated materials (like Bolt Threads\x92 spider silk5).First, he emphasized that the environmental impact of a process is inextricably linked its energy source.Once developed for space, Professor Lepech suggested, these materials might make their way back to Earth.Any bio-manufacturing facility in the US is mostly running on fossil fuels.Even at this massive scale, it is unclear that our latex production would be environmentally friendly as compared to traditional farming.It could be, then, that space exploration will provide the necessary incentives to develop biomaterials, incentives that our Earth market economy lacks.It forces us to reconsider our definitions of life (if we found \x93life\x94 on another planet, would we recognize it?)and confront the precariousness of human existence (what were the conditions that allowed life to appear and evolve on Earth?).Like other biomaterials companies, Mango Materials depends on bacteria to produce their plastic; however, their bacterial ecosystem runs on methane gas.We contacted Michelin Tires to ask them about their new sustainable natural rubber policy.6 We saw this policy as indication that tire companies might be looking for more sustainable sources of rubber, since natural rubber plantations currently contribute to deforestation and are susceptible to blight.7 However, we have yet to hear back from Michelin.', 'modeling': 'Elementary flux mode analysis allows us to calculate the elementary flux modes, which are analogous to the  metabolic freedom  of the metabolic model.In a standard, unmodified metabolic network, the amount of pABA being produced is relatively little.By changing the glucose uptake mechanism, we expect to see an increase in the amount of pABA.With R34 removed, the results were:From these results, we can identify R34 as a possible target for gene knockout.Using the EFMs, we are able to understand all of the "potential capabilities" of the organism.We also used several MATLAB scripts from Dr. Nils Averesch to calculate product yields from the EFM model.The calculated product yield was: The biomass vs. product yield graph is shown below:We generated a metabolic network where R34 (Phosphotransferase system (EC 2.7.1.69)) was removed.We wanted to use elementary flux mode

entire project is to do proof-of-concept work for a biologically produced balloon that can explore planetary atmospheres.We reduce the risk of allowing our E. coli to grow and reproduce outside of our

project as a biologically-created weather balloon for exploration on Earth, Venus, Mars, Titan, or other planetary bodies.What risks might our project pose in the "real world"?coli is a relatively safe organism to work with, but we are still engineering genes into our E. coli that confer a number of dangerous properties, such as antibiotic resistance and the ability to create and secrete proteins that are not innate to E. coli.They are produced in E. coli, purified, concentrated, and then bound to cellulose sheets to create a temperature-sensitive colour gradient for sensing nearby temperatures during flight.How did we limit risk-taking actions during our project?E.Other risks that our project may pose is that the balloon may introduce (biodegradable but still foreign) waste onto non-Earth planets, and we can work in the future to increase the degradability of our project as well as develop safe recovery mechanisms for our balloon in space.Additionally, E. coli will be made to produce melanin that can be linked to our various membrane types using a binding domain by taking advantage of E. coli s tyrosinase pathway.Our human practices project focuses around the work that might need to be done in the future for responsibly introducing this production method into the greater community.An additional project is using the natural gas production cycle of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to produce hydrogen and oxygen gas for flight in various atmospheres.E. coli transfected with appropriate DNA will be made to produce these materials endogenously, then lysed so that the

'background': '', 'description': '', 'design': 'The HMS will be prototyped extensively to develop a more efficient design, and its mobile app will continue to be streamlined.The fishBIT system combines the simplicity of standard fish tags with the novelty of a synthetic biology treatment.The plastic harpoon region was designed to ensure that the tag remains in its host under most forces.Overall fishBIT was able to handle both conditions very well - the clamp stayed in place, and the tag did not twist in a manner that would impeded the natural movements of the fish.To address these goals, fishPHARM has developed engineering solutions for the individualized delivery of flavocide, our bioengineered peptide treatment for BCWD, as well as a fish farm tank monitoring system for the constant monitoring of aquaculture conditions.Tugging gently on fish tags after applying them is standard procedure for tagging fish, and is a good test for the tenacity of the newly placed tag [1].One of the improvements that drylab is considering for the future is using a smaller clamp on our fish tag in order to have the tag maintain smooth movements in turbulent waters.Stress testing - We plan on using a stress machine to apply loads to the fishBIT barb, head/tubing interface, and clamp/tubing interface, in order to find maximum load capabilities.Testing of the fishBIT system in a hydraulic flow channel has shown that fishBIT can resist normal fish motion and speeds.FishPHARM presents the Heimdall Monitoring System (HMS).The main purpose of hydrodynamics testing was to see how well water at high speeds is able to flow over the fish tag.Thus, an orange was used in place of salmon tissue because the purpose of the testing was mainly to observe the flow of water over the part of the tag that is exposed outside the fish\x92s body.This system would make treating fish a much less time-consuming process, and would increase the appeal of the fishPHARM BCWD treatment method.Based on our testing on the agar block, we expected fishBIT to not be as effective as the standard tag.FishBIT is safe for the fish, and is constructed using materials which are all approved by the FDA.Additionally, our fish tag was able to successfully remain inside the agar (more testing about the effect of water flow on fish tag embedding is discussed in the \x93Hydrodynamics\x94 section).However, as seen by the effect on the agar, both our applicator and tag should be made narrower in order to inflict less trauma on the fish tissue.Industry standards for salmon were used to develop the size and shape of the fish tag [2].Inspired by fish tags, devices used to track fish in the wild, fishBIT allows fish farmers to target specific fish for flavocide treatment.fishPHARM\x92s mechanical engineering work centers around two main principles: 1) the real-world implementation of a peptide treatment for bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), and 2) the prevention of bacterial coldwater disease outbreaks on fish farms.Each delivery device can store enough flavocide to treat one fish for the prescribed dosing period, as well as be easily re-dosed, making it an effective means of treating multiple and recurring infections.Thus testing fishBIT at 1 m/s is indicative of the conditions that salmon using fishBIT will be living in.The fish tags and applicators, along with the peptide hydrogel, was packaged into a starter kit for distribution to fish farmers.However, our applicator was just as effective as the control applicator in penetrating the scales of the fish, and did not cause significantly more damage to the fish tissue.These factors are important in the health of a fish hatchery, and if improperly maintained, will lead to infections and higher mortality rates.Alternatively, a simpler test would be to attach weights to the fishBIT.This would also provide a reasonable estimate of the tensile strength.Animal and environmental safety guided the fishBIT and flavocide hydrogel design and development.A tube with an inner diameter of 1/16" and outer diameter of 1/8" was attached to the back of the fish tag to hold the hydrogel.A first prototype of the hardware is in the process of being built, and the mobile app is ready for testing.Future work will be done at fishPHARM to improve the design and manufacturing of fishBIT for mass production.The conclusions of our ballistics testing are also supported by the feedback from the Rome and Bath fish hatcheries.This would allow the estimation of the tensile strength of fishBIT, and to readjust the design or incorporate more durable materials if necessary.Named after the Norse god of surveillance, the HMS consists of sensor hardware to be installed within aquaculture tanks, as well as a mobile app for the continuous monitoring and collection of temperature, flow rate, dissolved oxygen concentration, and nitrate concentration.We tested fishBIT at the maximum speed of the Tilting Wind-Water Tunnel, which is approximately 1 m/s.The orange near the surface of the water represented turbulent water conditions that fishBIT would have to withstand, and the orange submerged approximately 10 cm under the surface of the water represented faster flowing water conditions.fishPHARM presents fishBIT, a novel means of delivering time-released flavocide gel to each fish individually.The control tag and the fishBIT tag both resisted a gentle tug on the exposed portion.FishBIT and the standard tags were applied with their respective applicators.We have simulated in the lab our fishBIT prototype working under the real world conditions that the device will encounter in an aquatic ecosystem.Furthermore, both the protein and the gel are both environmentally safe; the peptide is ubiquitous and the gel degrades easily.Our tag applicator was designed to be used just like conventional applicators, but with added comfort and easier handling.fishPHARM is currently working on an alternative, more efficient applicator that is inspired by firearm trigger mechanisms.Each fishBIT starter kits comes with 20 fishBIT tags, a tag applicator, a vial containing our novel flavocide, a needle, a syringe, and an information booklet.FDA-approved, biocompatible, and environmentally safe PLGA polymer will used to create the peptide hydrogel [3].FishBIT is a novel solution to drug delivery in fish.Farmers can choose to apply the fishBIT system to a few affected fish, or to their whole farms.We also wanted to make sure our applicator was as effective as the standard applicator in penetrating the skin and scales of salmon.It also serves as a marker to determine how much gel has dissolved.The bright red gel consists of the entericidin protein contained in FDA-approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid).One possible future method of delivering Flavocide would be a pneumatic injection system, which injects individual capsules in fish for rapid and accurate delivery.Additional testing will be conducted as we plan to apply for FDA approval of the device.Therefore, we used a diseased salmon and injected both systems into the tissue.We injected fishBIT and standard fish tags (from fishtagger.com) into a 1% concentration clear agar block to qualitatively assess damage done to fish tissue.A syringe was used to insert the hydrogel into the tube, and a clamp was placed at the end to prevent hydrogel escape.', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'Figure 1: The initial setup of the Part 2 model, showing the concentration of EcnB within the fish tag.Because the biodegradable hydrogel used to carry our EcnB peptide has several tunable properties including rate of biodegradation and internal concentration of EcnB, we decided to model the distribution of the peptide throughout the fish in order to better understand what properties we want in the gel.More and more peptide is released but, due to the small opening, there is a limit on how fast the peptide can diffuse out of the tag.To get at least an approximate target EcnB concentration, the Part 1 model should be adjusted and simplified.The gel has only degraded a short way through, but there is enough peptide to maintain a high flux into the fish.Figure 3: The Part 2 model after a longer time has passed.The degraded gel face has moved farther back, but the peptide concentration remains high throughout the entire tag.As can be seen in figures 2 and 3, the fish tag can maintain a high outflow concentration that approaches the initial gel concentration.We simulated hydrogel diffusion through the fish to determine the resultant concentration of EcnB peptide within a fish, assuming that all of the EcnB peptide within the gel is transferred into the subcutaneous layer of the fish.We decided to continue with the second part of the model, but using representative parameter values rather than experimental.The purpose of this second model was to find our ideal hydrogel degradation rate and peptide concentration for proper treatment of BCWD.The peptide exists only within the gel to start with.Figure 2: The Part 2 model after some time has passed.We decided on a 3D model for this part because the fish tag has some odd geometries and isn\x92t actually symmetric.The target concentration of EcnB on the skin was bounded by the minimum effective concentration against Flavobacterium and the toxic concentration of EcnB in the fish.We found a target EcnB concentration in the blood for a predefined concentration range on the skin by adjusting initial concentration parameters of the bloodstream.The opening of the tag was modelled as an open boundary, meaning the fish is large enough that concentrations of the peptide within the fish is negligible.Both parts were designed using COMSOL Multiphysics.Knowing the EcnB concentration necessary to combat Flavobacterium alone, we worked backwards to determine an effective EcnB concentration in the salmon bloodstream.This model was divided into the drug\x92s two main components, the EcnB and the hydrogel.We modelled the convection, diffusion, and degradation of the peptide through blood vessels, muscle tissue, and the skin of an idealized 2D fish.Because our 2D model hadn\x92t provided reasonable answers to formulate a target outward flux from the tag, we decided to make a representative model instead.We used SolidWorks to build the hollow of the fish tag into which we would fill the gel.', 'notebook': 'In addition, we researched specific tubing, clamps and other materials that we intend to utilize for the fish tag Policy and Practices We moved on to the topic of proteins to start to relate what we were introducing to YOURS kids with our own project so they would understand the relevance of our research.We also did research on a list of potentially compatible materials for the fish tag, including tubing, clamps, and syringes.Drylab Dry lab continued with the CAD design of the fish tag.Wetlab We encountered issues with getting past ligation stage with synthesized plasmid inserts and H backbone.To confirm EcnB expression, several SDS-PAGEs were done on constructs without stabilizing proteins to use for Western blots (to see their expression) and later ZOI assays.Drylab Dry lab outlined a comprehensive timeline for constructing business plan, fish tag testing, app design, and marketing.Drylab Dry lab discussed and finalized a design as well as the dimensions for the fish tag.We also started cloning MBP with Z constructs to stabilize the Ecn-B peptides since they were likely being degraded in the cell.Chloramphenicol ZOI control didn\x92t work.Using oak tag, we started a physical copy of the box.Policy and Practices Finally, we came a full circle and explained to the kids how bacteria can be potentially dangerous and helpful at the same time and how we can engineer their plasmids in ways to benefit other organisms.Drylab We came up with and finalized the design of an applicator for the fish tag that improves upon the existing design.Policy and Practices The YOURS kids got a tour of our lab and we taught them more about how DNA works in our body as the determining factor of our genetic characteristics.Policy and Practices We sent our prototype of the fishBit to Bath Fish Hatchery.We narrowed our search to a few fish hatcheries in the upstate New York region and began contacting them.That same week, both hatcheries and the field station were able to give us valuable critiques including their opinion on the size of our product, the ease of application, and even encouraged us to continue with what they believed to be a valuable contribution to improvement of the fish industry.Drylab Dry lab continued with the design of labels and business cards.Policy and Practices We sent our prototype of the fishBit to Rome Fish Hatchery and the Cornell Biological Field Station for feedback.Policy and Practices We continued the topic of DNA in bacteria with the YOURS kids by talking about antibiotic resistance and how we only want certain genes in our own experiments.Members conducted research into various aspects of the aquaculture industry, consumer behavior, and finances in order to construct a comprehensive business plan.He talked to us about the fish they raise, the types of diseases the fish face such as ferunculosis, and the overall day-to-day things the hatchery has to worry about like maintenance.Wetlab We cultured, ligated, and plated some of the new plasmids (A(LMNJKR) +H).We learned that the hatchery has chosen not to use fish tags and instead clips fish fins to keep track.There were some weird results on gels of other constructs, possibly due to mutations in the backbone (H).Flavobacterium growth was tested on different types of plates to see if our plates were the issue causing lack of growth.Drylab Business plan was reviewed by a professor with expertise in the area.Drylab Members designed potential business cards along with labels for the flavocide gel vials.Drylab Dry lab continued with construction of the box.We also received synthesized plasmids from DNA 2.0 with all EcnB inserts from biobricked Z constructs and MBP-TEV (not in pSB1C3).Sensor design for the app was started.Sweet\x92s opinion of the future for the fish/agriculture industry was that the environment would put greater stresses on wild fish and therefore depending on farm-raised fish would be beneficial in supplying the demand for more food in a world with a rising population.We had some issues with low DNA concentrations after gel purifications, so we increased amount of DNA used in digestions.The flavo subteam made cultures of two strains of Flavobacterium, and measured growth of bacteria with spectrophotometer.We also did a fun experiment with the kids with basic cooking ingredients to make a \x93volcano explode\x94 to introduce chemical reactions.Policy and Practices iGem members Grace, Casey, and Rishabh attended the Sciencenter Building with Biology event where they helped enthusiastic science-lovers on a Saturday morning learn how to spread plates, demonstrated the possibilities of 3D printing, and simulated rearranging genes with legos.Policy and Practices We took the YOURS kids to the Bathe hatchery.On Saturday, Grace and Saie went to the local Ithaca\x92s Farmer\x92s Market to find locals with opinions about GMOs and fish farming for our Humans and SynBio Facebook page.We listed materials, dimensions, and designs that would make up our fish tag kit.Finally, we explained our own project\x92s goals and how we would be going to a hatchery the next week to see how farmers have to handle bacterial diseases that affect fish.Drylab To market the product, the tag needs an appealing name.Policy and Practices We began searching for fish farm contacts, and started our YOURS mentorship program.We also tried ZOI test on Flavobacterium plates (of both strains), with ZA, ZB, and Chloramphenicol and dH2O as controls.We spoke to Bob Sweet who explained how they keep an eye on various conditions in the fish s environment through the use of chemicals.Wetlab ZE construct was sequenced and stored as glycerol stock along ZK, ZO, ZA, and ZB.Drylab Dry lab tested the durability of fishBIT using agar gel samples and dead fish samples.We re-plated Flavobacterium on new plates(both strains).Dry lab came up with the design of a box that can be used to market our products.In addition, we began researching sensors that could potentially complement the app.We successfully sequenced and glycerol stocked ZR, ZL, and ZJ constructs.We contacted Bath hatchery and set up a meeting time in July so that we could drive there and talk to representatives in person and our project in perspective of current solutions.SILS is a program of the Office of Undergraduate Biology (OUB) at Cornell that invited undergraduates to present their summer research activities.We hope to use any advice and critiques to update our fishBit to fit the industry\x92s needs in the best way possible.Policy and Practices iGem members Sachi and Saie presented at the The Summer Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) symposium.Wetlab We had issues with growing cultures for Gibson plates.Wetlab The second set of western blot revealed expression of ZG, MJ, and ZT.Wetlab Had some issues growing cultures on plates.AA+H (ZA) construct and AA+B (ZB) construct were sent for sequencing to verify the contents of the construct.Wetlab EcnB part extracted from A(ABEF) synthesized plasmids and purified.We introduced our mentors to the kids and taught them about DNA and its importance.We were also directed to speak to Andy Norse at Rome Hatchery who was more aware of chemicals used to treat water to prevent diseases, and we followed up with a call on Monday to plan a Skype meeting with Andy.Switched focus to getting expression from all biobricked Z constructs and MJ to use in ZOI assays.Wetlab At this stage, Z(A,B,E,G,J,K,L,O,R) constructs have been biobricked.The kids learned how to pipet and load something into a gel and watched as we showed them how we run gel electrophoresis experiments everyday.They learned about the ubiquitous nature of bacteria when they used cotton swabs to gather different bacterial samples from different areas in the building and let the samples grow overnight.Started using Phusion PCR on all constructs that had not been biobricked (for increased yield).Drylab Dry lab finalized plans for testing fishBIT.We determined that our plates (for the Flavobacterium) were the issue.Wetlab We had to re-culture several plasmids (pre-ligation).Drylab Meeting addressed fundamental parts of a business plan.The YOURS students also learned about how the fish are raised and transported in detail and were allowed to feed the fish.', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': 'When lifting heavy objects, proper lifting technique was used, and an

courses prior to the onset of work.During this program, safety officers reinforce safety procedures learned during the EH&S courses, discuss safety protocol pertaining to specific chemicals with which we work, and ensure all lab members fully understand all safety procedures.In the case of the wet lab in particular, this involves going through a detailed list of protocols, including all organisms, chemicals, and genetic constructs being worked with, to ensure conformity with the Environmental Health & Safety guidelines.Prior to the onset of work for the year, all new members are required to go through a safety training program.These team members are responsible for discussing the proposed work plan for the project with the wet lab and machine shop managers before starting work to ensure that it is safe to continue.These team members also act as liaisons to the wet lab and machine shop managers and, when necessary, the Institutional Biosafety Committee to ensure proper equipment usage.One team member each was chosen for the wet and dry lab subteams to ensure that all team members are working safely, whether with bacterial cultures or power tools.During these sessions, Dr. Archer familiarizes new members with the safety equipment and procedures specific to the labspace in which we work.They must go through the same safety training as all other team members, but are required to redo the training each time we recruit new members in order to keep up-to-date with safety considerations.While working in the machine shop we maintained a clean work environment so we could maintain visibility at all times.Enforcement: Team members who violate safety rules are required to work under the supervision of the safety officers for the remainder of the week, or until the safety officer believes the member is capable of performing the task unsupervised.Additionally, all team members must complete a lab orientation session with the manager of the BME instructional lab, Dr. Shivaun Archer.Dry Lab: We use the Emerson Machine Shop for fabrication; each of the dry lab subteam members has attended the prescribed training session for use of the shop and has learned to use each of the tools safely.Environmental Safety: If any biological materials escape from the lab there is a risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance from our engineered strains into other organisms.In addition, they maintain contact with the supervisors of the workspaces, usually in the form of a weekly check-in, to discuss any safety concerns that have arisen and ensure that equipment continues to be used properly.Safety Officers: The safety officers were chosen to be team members who could directly supervise the activities of the other team members.Laboratory Safety: Our project involves regular use of ethidium bromide, a DNA-intercalating agent known to cause cancer, as well as the use of powerful UV light, for visualization of gel electrophoresis.We maintain 2 copies of MSDS s for every chemical we use in the lab: one for our own records and one for the lab manager and users of the lab space who are not part of our team.Closed-toe shoes and long pants were also worn when working in the machine shop.Each member of the dry lab subteam was trained in the safe usage of the milling machine and the metal lathe.Wet Lab: All lab members wear nitrile gloves, closed-toe shoes, and use eye protection when working with volatile chemicals or UV light.All machine shop work is conducted under the supervision of the Emerson machine shop staff.For multiple infractions or complete disregard to safety protocols, a member may be restricted from laboratory work until he/she undergoes EHS chemical safety online training again, and demonstrates proper performance to a team leader of failed technique(s) in a controlled setting.All toxic waste is placed in a specialized receptacle and is picked up and disposed of by Cornell Environmental Health and Safety.We also work with ethanol lamps to maintain a sterile environment, which do involve having an open flame on the benchtop.It has been classified as a Biosafety Level 1 organism according to the NIH, and is thus essentially harmless to the human population.All biohazard waste is autoclaved and transported to the building s centralized waste facility where it is disposed of as regulated biological waste.These courses set specific guidelines and are the standard requirement for work in a biosafety-level 1 lab at Cornell.', 'keywords': 'U n k n o w n', 'track': 'Environment', 'part_favorite': '', 'part_normal':

training requirements of your institution (college, university, community lab, etc).Or, if you cannot give a link, briefly describe the requirements.Our institution has a committee dealing with environmental security, health, and safety (K3L), but their main concern is not in biosafety of modified organisms.Furthermore as our transformants will have drug resistance gene, we apply the safety so they will not escape into the environment.How would your project be used in the real world?Our RhamCOLIpid will be used in production of rhamnolipid.In addition, our biosafety committee (K3L) deals only in laboratory safety and environment security.Each school and faculty in our institution has their own safety regulation based on different educational background, so school and faculty also has their internal man-in-charge who concerns in biosafety application like Laboratory Assistant, Research Assistant, and Technician.But, specifically for biosafety in our institution, every year our institution has cooperate with other organization, for example, Indonesia Microbiology Association Bandung Branch to hold workshop or introduction about biosafety regulation for people who want to learn more about it, not only for college student but also for our institution employee.Who is responsible for biological safety at your institution?Our final product will be the rhamnolipid substance, not the bacteria, so it can be released into environment more safely.What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use?Describe any concerns they raised, and any changes you made in your project based on your discussion.Laboratory Assistant, College students and Technician.What are the biosafety guidelines of your institution?Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a

are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories?It can be accessed in http://indonesiabch.or.id/tentang-bkkhi/ Any further comments about your lab : So far our lab safety condition is quite good and can be handled well too.What is your chassis organism?We use E. coli DH5alpha for cloning and E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression.Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms, besides your chassis?From the three genomes, we was only able to got partial sequence of rhlA gene from Bacillus subtilis, but we don t use it make a new part.How will your project work?What future work might you do to reduce those risks?Our idea is to produce rhamnolipid in a controlled area such as in factory.Have your team members received any safety training yet?Yes, we have already received safety training.Please briefly describe the topics that you learned about (or will learn about) in your safety trainingWe learned about basic principle of biological safety including Laboratoy safety (Laboratory Acquired Infection (LAI), and Safety Regulation on Microbiological Hazard, Health and safety microbiology.To minimize the risk, same as the protect needs from ethylene glycol our team and the researchers in our lab always working safely by using gloves, lab coats, mask, and goggles (if necessary).Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.Yes, our country does.What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage?We also apply lab safety such as sterilising the bench before and after work, sterilising waste, etc.The actions you take to reduce that risk would include safety level 1 procedures, wearing rubber gloves, sterilizing waste, etcWorking with E. coli has contamination risk.(You might have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, an Office of Environmental Health and Safety, a single Biosafety Officer, or some other arrangement.)The risk is that the bacteria, carrying drug resistance gene(s), will be able to escape to the environment and spread the resistance to natural microorganism.To reduce this risk, careful handling and lab safety application will reduce the risk.Our product rhamnolipid has a wide variety of application that can use in several sectors, because a lot of sector need surfactant which can serve to reduces surface tension between two different solution, and increase solubility in water that environment friendly.Describe the goal of your project: what is your engineered organism supposed to do?', 'keywords': 'fluorescence fluorescent cerevisiae circularization questionnaires

the handbook turned to focus on pathogenesis, transmission, and prevention measures of mosquito-borne diseases; besides, we adapted the procedures of treatment to affected parts into cartoon, so that the public can read and understand it easily.Through the revising and communication on the handbook, we deepened our understanding that prevention and treatment of mosquito-borne diseases can not be achieved by a small group of people in a few days; it is a long journey, a huge project that involves whole human beings.As the people also living in mosquito-borne diseases endemic area, we hope we can do something for the people in African continent thousands miles away.After we finished the English handbook, we managed to get in touch with the Chinese educator in Zambia on social network, explained our project to him and showed our willing to cooperate.We decide to explore the way to alleviating mosquito-borne diseases transmission from the point of science and education and to set it as the main part of HUMAN PRACTICE program.May 2016, we distributed questionnaires about mosquito-borne diseases in China at first.6.Interview in Fujian Center for Disease Control and Prevention\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0August 31st, in order to ensure the academic rigor of the handbook, we went to Fujian Center for Disease Control and Prevention and invited mosquito-borne diseases expert, Haibao Xu, to revise the content.In the first edition of the handbook, we compiled the collected literature and arranged relevant knowledge on mosquito species, distribution areas, disease transmission, protection against mosquito, and rumor clarification.The iGEM and the synthetic biology are known by the public gradually.In order to let more people to know us as well as getting in touch with us, we optimized our platform on WeChat and Sina Microblog.We could not predict the result of it, but we were looking forward to it.Receiving the response that they were glad to cooperate with us, the whole team was so inspiring: carrying our dream and hope, the handbooks finally could travel across oceans to a wonderful land where we could not reach to.We expressed that we wanted to send our English handbooks to the educational institution where he was working and hoped he can help us to distribute these handbooks to the people there.At the beginning of July, we completed the first edition of the handbook.Being inspired, we came back to our lab and carried out the second edition of handbook immediately.From the statistics and analysis of the result, we found many people did not know basic mosquitoes  knowledge, such as mosquito species, mosquito distribution area.Meanwhile, it is a though public health problem.\x94 With the deepening of the experimental process and the increase of reading volumes, we firmly believe what WHO reported.In the half a day, we have obtained too much, and more importantly, we recognized the core of human practice program, which is enthusiasm.In the class, we talked about the development of Synthetic Biology, basics for Bioinformatics, methods in Molecular Biology and so on.We presented useful information in a more concise and clearer way, focused on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases and deleted mosquito eradication methods that can not be applied locally.We offered the service of answering the questions on the iGEM and the synthetic biology from our school\x92s students and sent the news of the Frontier Science Program sometimes.The followers of our platform can acquire a lot of useful information about the synthetic biology and iGEM from us.During the winter holiday at the beginning of 2016, our team held several times public lectures in our school.Watching at the photos and short videos from Zambia in the e-mail, our hearts were full of appreciation.We affirmed our belief: insignificant as we are, we should never give up any chances which may make differences; we should keep striving to make a better and brighter future for the world.At here, we grasped a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of health education and working procedures, learned the enthusiasm for health education career, and gained the methods of health education as well as guiding concept.With the curiosity of those questions, we waited for the response restlessly.About a week later, we received the e-mail from Zambia.How can we convey our common expectations to the people in other countries?Our answer is to make an English version of the handbook.October 2015, our team held the info session at the College of Plant Protection and the College of Life Sciences in our school to share the information on the synthetic biology with lots of students under the help of school.When Zika virus becomes the focal point of the world, malaria, the mosquito-borne diseases which have tortured human beings for hundreds of years, is still alive, even though we have already developed and promoted antimalarial drugs like Artemisinin.As the first team joined the iGEM in Fuzhou, the reports of our team\x92s story not only encourage the students in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, but also motivate many students in other schools.The aim of the public lectures is to improve students\x92 interests on the biology.This result led to the idea of producing a handbook about protection against mosquitoes, which covers basic knowledge of mosquito-borne diseases and demonstrates a certain amount of frontier anti-mosquitoes technology.All the students in our school can come to have these lectures for free.With these efforts, more and more students learn about the synthetic biology, and most of them would like to take part in the iGEM competition.Except that, we made survey about mosquitoes among public, visiting Center for Disease Control, interview experts in the related filed.We will introduce our Human Practice project in the timeline.From October to November, our team accepted the interview both from the newspaper and the school radio station.Although there are still some problems, it is already a great leap compared to the first one.Our second edition gained recognition in the promotion.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': 'Before the first week, we cultivated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.We sent our reserved parts to SYSU-CHINA team and ShanghaiTechChina_B team to help them to finish project.We distributed questionnaires about mosquito-borne diseases in China.We designed primers for \xa0Cry4a,Cry10a, Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2,EGFP genes.The greens in the figure are positive for transformation.We designed the qPCR primers use of detection Cry4a,Cry10a,Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2 genes expression.The genes from Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis strain BRC-LLP29Molecular cloning of Cry4a,Cry4b,Cry10a, Cry11a,Cyt1,Cyt2,EGFP genes.Vector is pChlamy-3.Analysis of Negative Result?\xa0Annealing reaction was not set.', 'protocol': 'Transfer the upper colourless aqueousphase into a new 1.5ml EP tube(RNase-Free).6.Add 250?l isopropanol, turn the tube upside down many times for around10 min, and let it sit at room temperature for 10 min until the white flocculearise,and then centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4?.7.Discard the supernatant,add 500?l,75%ethanol with DEPC,and mixthoroughly.Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4? and discard the supernatant.8.Dry it at room temperature or in the bechtop for 15 min.9.Add 15-20?l RNase-Free water to dissolve RNA when the precipitate becometransparent.Attention: All team members just can feeding the larvae of mosquitoes.While the transformation mixtures are incubating, add 5 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature into each well of a 6-well plate.Note: You will divide each transformation mixture between two wells of a 6-well plate after electroporation, so that the cells in each transformation mixture will recover in 10 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution total.9.Vortex vigorously for 10 second.Note: presence of small amount of unlysed cells would not affect the quality of the samples.Add appropriate amounts of buffer B (1/10 of buffer A) to the lysate and vortex vigorously for 10 seconds.Transfer/pour the cell lysate to pre-chilled filter cartridge, and centrifuge in a microcentrifuge at 14,000-16,000 rpm for 30 seconds.The clear cell lysate in collection tube is ready to use.Split the transformation mixture into two aliquots of 125 ?L each and transfer each aliquot into one well of the 6-well plate containing 5 mL/well of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature.(~30 mins)The larvae are fed every day with food C. On the 12th day (9 day old larvae), the water is changed with fresh water, and food is added (a pinch of food B and two tablets of food C).Wash the cuvette with 1 mL of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution to get most cells out of the cuvette and split and add the wash into the same two wells.12.The cage consists of a small 100 ml bottle with a cotton wick that is soaked with 10% sucrose (autoclaved) and a paper towel lining on the bottom to soak any potential sugar spills which may occur during cage handling.The beaker is kept inside the cage overnight for the mosquitoes to lay eggs.The filter paper containing the mosquito eggs is placed in a plastic tray with ~300 ml distilled water.Insert the HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a new 2 mL Collection Tube.Note: HBC Buffer must be diluted with isopropanol before use.Transfer the powder into a 1.5ml EP tube(RNase-Free).2.Add 500?l Trizol, vortex to mix thoroughly and let the tube sit at roomtemperature for 10 min.3.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g

RBC (in RPMI) is centrifuged (2000 rpm for 5 min) to pellet down the cells, and the packed RBC is resuspended in serum (O+ human serum) to obtain a 40% haematocrit.For this procedure, you ll need mosquito cages, 10% sterile sucrose solution, paper towels, beaker, what man filter paper, glass feeders, human blood and serum, water bath, parafilm, distilled water, clean plastic trays, mosquito food (described below), mosquito net to cover the trays, vacuum, and a collection chamber to collect adults.Food A: grounded fish food (Aquaricare).The blood must be kept at 37°C always for the feeding.The 3-5 day old adult female mosquitoes are fed on blood to lay eggs.For blood feeding, an artificial membrane (parafilm) feeding method is used as follows:Red blood cells (see above for blood preparation) are mixed with heat inactivated serum to obtain a ~40% haematocrit (packed RBC 40% and serum 60%).Insert a HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection Tube.17.On the eighth day (5 day old larvae), the larvae population is diluted from 1 tray to ~10 trays, with a pinch of food A and two tablets of food C in each tray.Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection Tube.10.Transfer the entire sample to the HiBind® DNA Mini Column, including any precipitate that may have formed.20.Add 50-100 ?L Elution Buffer heated 65°C to the HiBind® DNA Mini Column.Note: Make sure to add the Elution Buffer to the center of the HiBind® matrix.Insert the HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a new nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.30.Transfer the HiBind DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.21.In a separate tube, prepare a control transformation with the pChlamy_2/Control Vector, linearized using PvfI restriction enzyme.6.Prior to protein extraction pre-chill the protein extraction filter cartridge with collection tube on ice.Pellet cells from bacterial culture in a 1.5-2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube with a table-top microcentrifuge at top speed for 1-2 min.This is added to the glass feeder.The feeder is connected to a warm water-jacket (37°C), and placed on the cage to allow the mosquitoes access to the membrane surface.The mosquitoes are allowed to feed for ~30 minutes.The females will lay eggs two days after they feed on blood.Food is given every day to the larvae/pupae by carefully removing the net to avoid escaping of adults.The adults are collected into a cage through an aspirator connected to vacuum.Harvest 15mL of the cell (per transformation) by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature.Centrifuge the empty HiBind® DNA Mini Column at maximum speed (?10,000 x g) for 2 minutes to dry the column.Note: This step is critical for removal of trace ethanol that may interfere with downstream applications.29.Gently tap the electroporation cuvette to mix the contents and resuspend the settled cells, and place the cuvette in the cuvette chamber.10.Add 30-100 ?l Elution Buffer or sterile deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.1.The solution should eventually turn purple and leave a rust-brown precipitate, which can be removed by filtering through two layers of Whatman#1 filter paper, repeating the filtration if necessary until the solution is clear.Acta 1763, 578-594.For 1liter final mix, dissolve each compound in the volume of water indicated.The EDTA should be dissolved in boiling water, and the FeSO4 should be prepared last to avoid oxidation.Mix all solutions except EDTA.Resuspend the cells in 250 ?L of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature by gently pipetting up and down.5.Centrifuge no more than 3 mL culture or 1 x 109 cells at 4,000 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.4.A pinch of food A is added to the tray and eggs are allowed to hatch to larvae during the next days.Growing larvae are fed every day with two tablets of food C, and monitored for density and population.Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Isolate a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate, and inoculate a culture of 1- 5 mL LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic.After the final wash, the pelleted RBCs are resuspended in an equal volume of RPMI medium and stored at 4°C (can be kept for 8-10 days).Vortex to completely resuspend the pellet.Note: The amount of enzyme required and/or the length of incubation may need to be modified depending on the bacterial strain used.Autoclaved 1000ml of the solution (121°C, 15 min, standard liquid cycle).* For reactions with larger volumes of vector and PCR insert (> 7 ?l of vector + insert), double the amount of enzyme premix, and add dH20 for a total volume of 20 ?l.2.However, you might want to check the pH in this case and adjust it to around 7.0 using either KOH or HCl as needed.To prepare sulfur-free trace elements for hydrogen generation, the sulfate salts can be replaced with equimolar chloride salts (ZnCl2 10.0 g; CuCl2.2 H2O 1.00 g; FeCl2.4 H2O, 3.60 g).1.Take 50-100mg tissue stored in -80? or liquid nitrogen.Due to random integration and silencing events in C. reinhardtii, we recommend picking at least 10 positive colonies and testing them for the expression level of the gene of interest by RT-PCR (or Western blotting, if you have the antibody to detect it).Tris Acetate Phosphate (TAP) medium from Gorman, D.S., and R.P.(~ 30-40 mins)The adults (both males and females) are then kept in the insectary room for 4-5 days, fed on 10% sucrose before they are again blood-fed to begin the next cycle.The used trays and cages need to be cleaned and dried before they can be used again.NOTE: There can be some variations in the mosquito rearing method and different labs may have different techniques.Das, S., Garver, L., & Dimopoulos, G. (2007).Each 50-100 ?L elution typically yields 60-70% of the DNA bound to the HiBind® matrix.Be careful not to disturb the pellet and that no cellular debris is transferred to the HiBind DNA Mini Column.12.If the OD750 does not reach 0.3 within 24 hours of incubation after dilution, incubate the cells for an extra 3\x965 hours to allow for an additional cell division.2.Transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.7.About 20% of the colonies should be positive for the gene of interest.Add 250 mL Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly.5.Electroporate the cells with the above parameters.11.Transfer suspension into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.6.To obtain DNA at higher concentrations, elution can be carried out using 50 ?L Elution Buffer (which slightly reduces overall DNA yield).Place the plates agar side at the bottom in algal growth chamber set to 26°C and 50 ?E m\x962 s\x961.Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I bought from OMEGA bio-tek company toextract plasmids and the detail protocol is showed as bellow:1.If no precipitate forms, the solution is still usable.Fresh blood is collected with a syringe and put in a sterile room temperature at 2000 rpm for 5 min.After cooling and antibiotic addition, the LB agar was plated out using aseptic technique.Vortex for 20 seconds at maximum speed to mix thoroughly.Note: If any precipitate can be seen at this point, break the precipitate by pipetting up and down 10 times.16.Do not disturb the pellet.Note: A wispy precipitate may form upon addition of BDL Buffer; it does not interfere with DNA recovery.15.The protein yield with this method is about 2.0-3.0 mg/ml.Mix all the reagents, adding APS and TEMED last (gives 2 gels).Fill the separation gel in the SDS page apparatus and overlay with isopropanol.After polymerization discard the isopropanol and fill the stacking gel on top and insert the comb.Start the gel electrophoresis by applying 100-120 V and stop when marker reaches the bottom of the gel.Resuspend the cells with gentle pipetting in 150 ?L of TAP-40 mM sucrose solution at room temperature.17.Vortex briefly to resuspend the cells.Add appropriate amounts of room temperature bacterial lysis buffer A to cell suspension (Table 1).Measure the optical density of the C. reinhardtii\xa0cultures at 750nm (OD750)Note: For best performance, the OD750 of cultures should be between 0.3\x960.5.Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.Note: DNA Wash Buffer must be diluted with 100% ethanol before use.The transformation efficiency with the pChlamy_3 construct will depend on the nature, size, and codon content of the gene of interest, and the physiological state of the cells.20.(~ 8-10 mins)The pupae are allowed to emerge to adults for the next 2 - 3 days.Place the 6-well plate in the algal growth chamber set to 26°C and 50 ?E m\x962\xa0s\x961.13.Centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column for 2 minutes at maximum speed to dry the column matrix.20.Please inform the administrator before emergence to ensure safe.This protocol describes mosquito rearing in the insectary.Some people shorten the time for formation of the precipiate by bubbling the solution with filtered air.However, increasing elution volume reduces the concentration of the final product.Wheneverything is dissolved, cool to 70 degrees C. Keeping temperature at 70, add 85 ml hot 20% KOH solution (20 grams / 100 ml final volume).Bring the final solution to 1liter total volume.Centrifuge the cells at 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature.15.Complete digestion of the cell wall is essential for efficient lysis.The same mosquitoes can be used to lay eggs more than once.The mosquitoes that are not needed for experiments or rearing can be killed by placing the cage in a freezer.Repeat Steps 24-26 for a second DNA Wash Buffer wash step.28.If a shaking water bath is not available, incubate the samples and shake or briefly vortex every 20-30 minutes.9.Add 2 ?g linearized plasmid DNA (i.e., pChlamy_3 construct containing your gene of interest) into the resuspended cells.Ultimately, this procedure resulted in three 1L LB agar solutions with a different antibiotic in each.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute to elute the DNA.Transfer the cleared supernatant from Step 8 by CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind DNA Mini Column.A small filter paper wrapped in a conical shape is put in a small beaker containing distilled water, making sure that filter paper gets moist.Plate the entire cell solution from each

stocked \xa0in cloning.Basedon the express vector pChlamy-3 which provide by Huiying Zhang, we constructed13 \xa0express vector in\xa0Chlamydomonasreintmrdtii.9.Basedon the different toxicities of\xa0Cryand\xa0Cyt, we contrasted six toxingroups to select \xa0the best group.6.', 'safety': 'Meanwhile, we used the CC503 and FA479 strains which have no toxicity to any organisms.The ultimate goal of our project is to use Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\xa0which can produce mosquito-larvicidal proteins in the natural environment to control mosquitoes.Meanwhile, we design a special pair of primers to detect the Safety Tag which owns no homology to the other DNA fragments.We inserted a short DNA which we called Safety Tag sequence into the non-functional fragment of vector.Based on the experiment of growth under the different conditions, we can predict the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\xa0after releasing in the natural environment.In the future, we plan to add non-functional gene fragment tag to expression vector.The department of environment or any biology department can make use of PCR to detect the leak of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.The ultimate target of our project is to put our products in the natural environment to control the amount of mosquitoes\x92 larvae.The first part is the Safety Tag sequence and the other on is a suppressive recombination sequence.The Safety Tag records the brief information about products as following: The Number of Gene,\xa0Group, Years,\xa0Back-up Code, Supervisory Organization, Supervisor Code.Meanwhile, before using the eggs to rare mosquitoes, the pathogen detection lab will use PCR technology to detect the potential pathogen in mosquitoes.The primers are used to detecte Zika virus \xa0polyprotein gene;Lane7.PCR product.The primers are used to detecte Zika virus polyprotein gene.But considering the potential problem, we must pay attention to the risk of gene dispersal.The primers are used to detecte Dengue virus

Yellow fever virus; Lane5.PCR product.Except for these basic detections, the first hundred generations of mosquitoes can not be used to detoxify completely.To achieve the function of recording information, we convert this information from alphabetic characters to DNA code (ATCG) as appendix1.The recombination suppression sequence is firstly founded in the sex chromosomes of Rumex acetosa L.\xa0This fragment can impede the recombination between chromosomes.Before rearing, all mosquitoes were undergone serious pathogen detection especially Zika, Yellow fever virus and Dengue virus by immunology and PCR technology.Because of it, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\xa0amostly can not become the dominant population in the natural environment.What\x92s more, BNU-CHINA team helped us to build the growth model of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural model.To solve this problem, we designed a practical system and protocol based on the PCR technology.The total genome is extracted from

improved elongated GS linker.In the experiment, we hypothesized that an elongated linker would enhance the function of the fusion protein for the original linker is too short for the proper folding of the two domains.However, we found no result in the previous history using this linker.So we went to the linker library in iGEM part registry website to search for a longer linker.Through the reference searching, we found that the previous research all used the three-alanine linker.(see Design & Device)This year, we have designed fusion proteins of spider toxin in conjunction with snowdrop lectin by the three-alanine linker.In the experiment(See the Link), the fusion protein with the elongated GS linker did show the enhanced repellent effect.Therefore, we modified the sequence and added three more amino acids into the linker in case it was still too short for proper protein folding.Observed from the phenomenon, we did prove the enhanced function of the fusion proteins, so we speculate that the fusion protein has a better secondary structure than the original ones.It is a revolutionary system that not only guarantees the safety of the farmers and customers worldwide but also safeguards the sustainability of the environment and ecosystem.', 'design': '2001, 276, 40306\x9640312Elaine Fitches, Martin G.

[5]In nature, spiders inject venom into the haemolymph of insects\x92 that causes the death of the prey.AnachnoServer is an online database that contains nearly 800 peptide toxin information from 78 spider species[1], and UniProt is a library of protein information.Also, snowdrop lectin is proved to be resistant to proteolytic activity in the insect gut.Another apprehension about nowadays insecticidal pesticide is that through bioaccumulation, the pesticide chemical residue will accumulate in the human body, and can\x92t be degraded by us.The traditional pesticide will kill all the insects in the farmland no matter it is pest or not.The inspiration for Pantide originates from the food chain.The active site in the peptide that performs its toxicity are the amino acids located in loop regions.[6] Snowdrop Lectin recognizes the glycoproteins on the epithelial cell in the insect gut and facilitates the fusion protein to cross the epithelial cell by transcytosis.To tackle this problem, Pantide is species specific to several orders of pests, Hv1a targets Lepidopteran, Orthopteran, and Dipteran, Sf1a targets Lepidopteran, and Dipteran, OAIP targets Lepidopteran and Coleopteran.The devices in each area will collect the farmland conditions respectively, and the data will be transmitted to one host device in each area through Bluetooth, and then the host will upload the data of its area up to the cloud through WiFi.By using these three peptides alternately, the pest is hard to have resistance.For the practical application in the farmland, the farm will be divided into several areas, in each area, several sets of devices and sensors will be installed.Take Hv1a as an example for proving the stability of ICK; Hv1a is highly stable in the temperature range of -20°C to 75°C and pH values of 1 to 8.Sf1a is a toxic peptide derived from Segestria florentina (Tube-web spider).In this case, we chose snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) lectin as a carrier of toxin peptides to create a fusion protein.Spiders are one of the most successful terrestrial venomous creatures on earth.Hv1a is lethal to several insect orders but is not toxic to mice.; Christie, M.J.; King, G.F. \x93Discovery and structure of a potent and highly specific blocker of insect calcium channels,\x94 J.

protein works performs its toxicity better.In the two-hour test, we can see that most of the tobacco cutworms move to eat the negative control group, which proves the repellent effect of Pantide.After the three experiments, we have three conclusions.Pantide performs its toxicity as a repellent in vivo.The remained leaves area decreased as the concentration of PANTIDE decreased, which shows the dose response of Pantide.In comparison with the two other design, we could find out that the remained leaves area with improved Hv1a-lectin were all more than that of the original Hv1a-lectin and Hv1a.(a)

in an easy way, the testee selection, and experiment design would be briefly described.(Table 1)After amplification with PCR, the PCE products of Hv1a, Sf1a, and OAIP have a length of around 500bp? and Hv1a-Lectin, Sf1a-Lectin, and OAIP-Lectin has a length of 750bp~1000bp? and Hv1a-Lectin with GS linker has a length of 893bp.It shows in figure5.To use the p-value as an indicator of statistical significance, we compared Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin with the negative control; it shows that the remained leaf disk area of Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin are significantly different from negative control, shown in figure6.To sum up, the Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin work well in vivo.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification analysis of electrophoresis of seven PCR products with Marker labeled length on the left

Hv1a-lectin with the original three-alanine linker and a longer GS linker.The T-test analysis in different dose of OAIP/OAIP-lectin.In this experiment, we compared the toxicity effect of the three toxin designs including Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin/Hv1a-lectin with GS linker to test the toxicity effect.To know the qualitative toxicity effect of Pantide, we prepared the samples with the sonicated LB solution lysate containing Pantide-expressed E. coli Rosetta-Gami strain and diluted it with the three concentration.SDS-PAGE result of the seven purified Pantide products compared with the unpurified one, and with Marker labeled length on the left hand.In the following experiments, we used E. coli BL21 Rosetta-Gami strain to produce Pantide.The T-test analysis in different dose of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin.Figure4 shows the pictures of the remained leaf disks after twelve hours of feeding assays.The tobacco cutworms have a preference on the leave disks without applying Pantide.Although Pantide does not act as a biological pesticide as our hypothesis had mentioned, we may conclude that it is a biological insect repellent, which corresponds to our ideology of lowering the artificial impacts on the environment and simultaneously achieve effective pest control.Remained leaves in the GS-linker improvement test with the Hv1a, Hv1a-lectin, and Hv1a-lectin GS-linker improved.Figure14.All the experiments were to check the functions of Pantide for leaf protection, so the observation of the results would focus on the remained area of the leaf disks.The dose response is shown in figure5.Compared Hv1a with Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area in the Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a, which means the repellent efficiency of Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a.Figure11 shows the ratio of the remained area on the leaf disks.Figure5 shows the percentage of the remained area on the leaf disks.After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratios, we measured the area with the software imageJ.After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratio, we measured the area with the software

further purified Pantide to check whether it is well-expressed.The effect can be roughly ranked as:Hv1a-lectin > Hv1a > E. coli > Negative controlWe got the similar result in the Sf1a/Sf1a-lectin and OAIP/OAIP-lectin.Figure7.The p-value of the T-test can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other.In the test of Pantide toxicity, we chose tobacco cutworm as the testee for the insect appetite tests because all the Pantide targets lepidopterans.Remained leaf disks in the pre-test with the OAIP and OAIP-lectin.Figure11.Remained leaf disks in the pre-test with the Sf1a and Sf1a-lectin.Figure8.The observed phenomenon can be analyzed below.With the dilution of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area decreased, which indicates the dose response.SDS-PAGE result of the six Pantide-expressed sonicated products compared with the unexpressed sonicated one as a control and with Marker labeled length on the left hand.Afterward, we sonicated E. coli and then ran SDS-PAGE to make sure that Pantide fell into the correct ranges.The positive control in the experiment was to apply Bacillus thuringiensis on the leaf disks, which is nowadays the most widely-used bioinsecticide, and the negative control group in the test was DD water.This experiment is the pre-test that shows us whether the amount of Pantide is sufficient enough to perform the toxicity against the larvae.(Table 2)The gel of SDS-PAGE result is correct, and here is our result.Besides, there is also a Hv1a without the linker between the repellent peptide and the lectin served as a comparative sample.In the picture, it shows as a star.We hope that we can observe the difference of the three toxins in vivo.We applied the sample onto the leaf disks and put five cutworms into the separate cabinets for feeding assays.We preserved all the result of the remained leaves sealing with the glass paper and calculated the percentage of the remained area on the leaves.The results consist of three parts-feeding assay pre-test, the fusion protein improvement test, and preference test.The mechanism of the repellent effect is so far unknown.The toxicity efficacy of Pantide is equal to Bacillus thuringiensis.According to the mechanism of Pantide, Pantide is supposed to perform its toxicity in the nervous system of the larvae.(Figure 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g) As a result, the constructions of BioBrick were correct.Figure 3.With the elongation of the linker, the improved fusion protein has the best repellent effect.**Note: The word \x93Pantide\x94 in the following paragraph refers to the collection of all the toxin design in our project.Figure6 shows the p-value with the star attached to indicate P < 0.05 and two stars to indicate P < 0.01.B is the elution product of purification.', 'safety': 'To ensure that Pantide will degrade into amino acids when it is released into the environment, we have done an experiment to prove that Pantide does degrade in the ultraviolet light.Therefore, we should guarantee that Pantide is safe to humans and harmless to the environment.So, after we expressed Pantide with E. coli, the LB broth containing E.coli should be first sonicated by the sonicator to let Pantide be soluble in the LB broth.(See the experiment) Once we have known that Pantide will degrade in the ultraviolet light, we may conclude that Pantide will degrade in the natural light over time.One is the laboratory safety; the other is the safety of spraying Pantide into the environment.Before entering the laboratory, all the members in NCTU_Formosa must receive several training courses and evaluate exams offered by Environmental Protection and Safety Center.So it is harmless for the environment.With the degradation modeling simulation (See the Modelling), we may also apply the degradation rate into the automatic spraying device.For humans, Pantide will not have any negative effect on human health.As a result, we design a processing standard in the laboratory.When the customer gets the agricultural produce from the market, most of the Pantide is thought to have degraded into amino acids and even there is some residue of Pantide on the surface of the product.When it is washed into the soil or in water resources, Pantide is ineffective to the microbiomes and the vertebrate in the ecosystem.The content of the training courses consists of four parts.For the basic laboratory safety instruction, we learned the safety level of laboratories and personal protective equipment.For the laboratory emergency response, we learned of how to react to several emergency situations and certain procedure dealing with specific chemicals.For the toxic chemical operation and management, we learned the content of the material safety data sheet (MSDS).For biosafety, we learned biological hazard, including levels of biohazard and instructions of dealing with biological trash.The four training courses contain an evaluating exam.Instead, it can be as the fertilizer.The product we spray into the environment should not contain any genetically-modified organisms.SDS-PAGE gel and the concentrations of boiling test to native Hv1a-lectin (17.1 kDa).After taking the courses and passing the exam, we all get certificates for each training.In the future, we plan to spray Pantide onto the environment.', 'keywords':

construction work.', 'background': '', 'description': '', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'Secondly, we knew more supportive policies on the new environmental technology, and to know that the application of the genetic engineering in the disposal of pollution will not contradict the related laws gives us more confidence about our project.Overall, the heavy metal pollution of Chinese offshore cannot be overlook when we use seawater as material.In normal desalination process, even normal resource water has to go through some sedimentation processes.As to the opinion on the treatment of industrial polluted water, most respondents are unsatisfied and concerned about it since lots of problems still exist.In this part, we investigated the knowledge of heavy metal contamination and the knowledge of biological approaches dealing with heavy metals.So there is no need or trend to have the heavy metal pollution in a more detailed or specific legislation.In the second aspect, we questioned the supportive policies on new environmental technologies from the national and local government.Firstly, we obtained more legal knowledge about the pollution of heavy metals and water pollution, and thus we have a much clearer concept of the current legal situation in China.Many factories utilized the microorganisms to extract and purify precious heavy metal from the tailings.During the interview, Dr. Tang also asked us about the state of the metal that we retrieve as well as the adaptability of our bacteria.Also, there is a sum of considerable fund specifically supporting the circular economy from the government which we can take advantage of.In the third aspect, we demonstrated our concerns about the disadvantage of biological methods when dealing with the environmental pollution.Companies are optimistic about new technologies because not only are they beneficial for the company itself, the government encourages the development of new technology as well.In the end, Dr. Tang said that our project was aiming at a practical problem in our society and that we should improve the accuracy of heavy metal adsorption.And it offers an optimistic background to the development of new environmental technologies.In view of the fact that our project\x92s target is pollution control and recycling, Mr. Wu gave us more advice on how to use policies and funds to support our project.We also propagated our project among the pupils and their parents to know about different opinions.After the activity, we interviewed the organizer of the environmental group and learned a lot about the environmental groups and development of sewage disposal in China.This also means that the factories can\x92t avoid to deal with different pollutions in costal seawater, including heavy metal pollution.No doubt that it could be a promotion both for our project and the application of synthetic biology on environmental issues.On 4th August, we visited the BRUMP recycling technology corporation in Hunan Province.He explained that the heavy metal pollution is a cross-field pollution, so it can be cataloged into atmosphere, water or soil pollution so as to have a hierarchical supervision.Respondents reflect that the information is extremely limited and wish to learn more about heavy metal pollution.In a word, from the statistics above, both the resource and the number of respondents ensure that our survey is of convincing credit.There is a lack of useful and convincing information about the treatment of pollution.Therefore the first problem that we meet with is related to the living conditions of our chassis.In this concept, seawater desalination combing heavy-metal recycling will be the key to build the heavy metal\x92s balance.The origin of heavy metal comes from the river, therefore, it is hard to control from the origin.Last but not least, we are inspired by the idea to expand our project to the disposal of soil pollution.During the visit, we interviewed with Dr. Tang, the adviser of the company about our project as well as the development of the sewage disposal enterprises.The advantage of our idea is that we only need to make sure that our engineered B. subtilis can survive in sea water while the low efficiency problem is also inevitable.Thirdly, we got information about the policies\x92 support to industrialize our project.Furthermore, we will be dedicated to spread the scientific and objective attitude towards the transgenic technology to the people around in the future, since the more rebuttal there is, the clearer the truth becomes.2.NGO ( Non-governmental organization ): Leader of an environmental group in NanjingThere are many environmental groups which are devoted to environmental protection in Nanjing.Because of the serious pollution caused by heavy metals in these years, it is hard to make more detailed and revised laws in a short time, but the judicial interpretation has been able to greatly strengthen the enforcement of the standard.On the second problem about the further legislation, the attitude of Mr. Wu is negative.Nanjing-China team will explain the details which needs to be discussed to make this working for real.First, we start with the features of seawater and the end purpose of the combination project.Therefore, on July 3rd, 2015, we interviewed with the expert Mr. Cigang Yu, the research assistant from the research center for nature conservation and biodiversity, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People\x92s Republic of China (NIES).Furthermore, he inspired us to use the biological methods to cope with soil pollution.At the end of the interview, Mr. Wu highly complimented our project and our in-depth thought on the law and policy issues of the project.In fact, one of the safety concern of general seawater desalination is what do we do with those sediments.Secondly, companies also pay a lot attention to whether the technology can cause pollution to the environment.He mentioned that these two problems are pivotal for the further development of our project.We have also shown to him our iGEM project as well as the iGEM competition.Also, the offshore is relatively big water body which makes the pollution hard to increase as well as decrease.The presenters in our team also got more familiar with the presentation.Therefore, it will benefit a large community if we help them participate in the iGEM competition.We also expressed our sincere appreciation for his patient answers and explanations.In conclusion, we did learn a lot from the interview.During the past two month, we have collected 498 samples.In addition, although the biological methods have the relatively low efficiency, it has more advantages such as the moderate condition and low-frequency of the second pollution.Unfortunately, the microorganisms used in our project were both chosen.The precious experience not only enlightened us about the design of our experiment, but also provided us with new ideas about synthetic biology.In his opinion, the genetic engineering project is only excluded by the agriculture, not the disposal of pollution.Therefore, we made contact with them and participated in the activity named \x93Journey of Love\x94 on July 26th, 2015.He wished that we could get a satisfying result in the final.One problem is that the regulations on the heavy metal pollution are vague with weak enforcement; another problem is about the necessity for the further legislation and regulation of the heavy metal pollution.As to the first problem, Mr. Wu told us that the current standard is actually a relatively early one, and the latest one is only a judicial interpretation.He also suggested that biological methods aren\x92t the most prevalent yet except microbial methods.The interview clarified the attitude of Chinese government towards the transgenic technology, and helped us to have more in-depth understanding for the safety of GMOs, and to build up expectations for the future development of the transgenic technology.He also said that he was passionate about biological methods because there are inevitable disadvantages in chemical methods such as the high expenses, secondary pollution, low specificity and so on.We also consulted him about the aspects to which enterprises pay more attention because we wanted to improve the practical value of our project.Nevertheless, the technology also arouses widespread public criticisms in its legitimacy and morality.However, because it is plant, the study and application of mangrove will be relatively slow.Seawater desalination is one of the few seawater alternating technology that pumps in the seawater.On the one hand, the genetic engineering was what our project used, but we were not sure about whether the genetic modified bacterium we created would have some inhabitation from the government and the public.We also helped to show them how to use environmental detection device to test the concentration of pollutants in the river.Secondly, with the growing concern towards the pollution, the amendment and the government\x92s implement of laws have been launched.Since that is the case, the transgenic technology is its basic methods inevitably.We put forward that the time of the policies\x92 issuing is early and the incentive is not obvious, so is it necessary to have a further promotion of the policies?The key of transgenic technology is the transgene.The GMOs are now widely used in scientific research and are also applied in agriculture as the source of genetically modified food.Critics for GMOs, especially for the genetically modified food, claim that the risks of the food have not been adequately identified and managed, and they also question the objectivity of regulatory authorities.Firstly, the fund for environment technology comes from various sources such as the provincial research fund and Nanjing local government\x92s investment.Among them, average lead concentration in the Bohai Sea is over the first seawater class, and some of the monitoring spot detect a number over the second seawater class.Besides, previous captains of Peking-iGEM and Tsinghua-iGEM were also invited to give speeches about the development of synthetic biology in China.The purpose of the interview was about the transgenic technology and GMOs.Also, there are concerns about the contamination of the non-genetically modified food supply from the genetically modified food.IT also brings some safety concern by introducing new species to original ecosystem.For example, the main recovery method focuses on mangrove in China.Thus, we should look at two projects\x92 combination as environmental restoration and seawater alternation using the same artificial water flow.Back to circular economy, this will increase the force that heavy-metal waste change into resource with a low cost adding.The most important aspect is the manipulation of the technology.The introduction of a transgene has the potential to change the phenotype of an organism.All the 31 teams invited to the summit were invited to give presentations about their project.There are many technicians in the company who barely know about the principle of the technology.Many pupils were impressed by the pollution, exhorting them to no longer throw domestic garbage into the rivers.He believed that the support from the government is important but not indispensable because of two reasons.As to the age, respondents of 18-25 years old, such as university students, account for more than one-third of the total.The core of the concept is to maintain the balance between resource and waste.He told us that methods such as precipitation, resin adsorption, reverse osmosis and electrochemical methods are the most frequently used methods.Besides, they are very familiar with the conditions of the aquatic environment in Nanjing.We have been collaborating with each other since early July and the collaboration is still going on.Prof. Dai showed great interest in it and told us that he intended to organize their students to participate in the competition in 2016.In its report, the concentration of lead, copper, zinc and mercury in seawater which is over the first seawater class at some monitoring spots.The efficiency of absorption largely depends on the mobility of seawater.The summit was a rehearsal of the Jiant Jamboree in September.In China, this is one of the guiding ideology for the economic and society development.It shows that there are plentiful of ways but the Internet is the main information resource.Most of these criticisms are direct to the genetically modified organism (GMO), which refers to any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques.We have designed a questionnaire about the treatment of heavy-metal contaminated sewage both in English and Chinese and distributed it through the Internet.On the other hand, the efficiency of the biological method was relatively low, so we wanted to seek for more help at present.Mr.We come up with an idea of combining the two projects to achieve a win-win goal, which is to desalinate sea water with a high concentration of heavy metal.(For details about the institute, see \x93Brief introduction of NIES\x94 He is researching on the biosafety of GMOs.So we decided to do some tests to confirm whether they can survive simultaneously in sea water with heavy metal.Therefore, we believe more information should be spread widely in this part.In the meanwhile, most respondents don not know about biological approaches dealing with heavy metals.Sea water with high concentration of heavy metal go through our purification device first so that heavy metal contaminants can be adsorbed.We volunteered to take approximately 50 pupils to the polluted river called the Hong Hua River.That is to say, this survey covers mainly university students and intellectuals who have enough social experiences and are easily influenced by new-born stuffs.When surveying about public awareness of sewage treatment, most respondents (98%) pay attention to such sort of news in daily life, which illustrates high attention paid to water pollution.The idea of cooperating two project is to merge Nanjing-China team\x92s project to achieve a new seawater recovery and utilizing system.The word \x93circular economy\x94 should be familiar to most people.The prospect of our project will be better as long as we keep polishing the details of it.On 14th-15th August, our team was invited by Peking University to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee).', 'modeling': 'Using matlab, we can solve technical computing problems much faster.Matlab has a wide range of applications, including signal and image processing, communications, control design, test and measurement, financial modeling and analysis, and computational biology.In our modeling, we use matlab to find out the influences imposed on protein expression by certain parameters, such as pH, ion concentration, etc.Our project uses Bacillus subtilis as the bioreactor to deal with heavy metals: Au, Pb and U.In the first part, we worked out growth curves of B. subtilis\x91s vegetative state and spore state, using Logistic model.In the third part, we used GolB-Au as an example to shed light on the optimal concentration of metal ions and the time for binding proteins\x92 saturation.Through modeling, we know B. subtilis better and find optimal experimental conditions.Therefore, optimal PH for growth is 7.0.Combining the experimental data with modelling, we found that sucrose is the best carbon resource for the high growth rate and maximum cell number.Combining the experimental data with modelling, we found that using corn flour as the nitrogen resource contributes to a high growth rate of bacillus subtilis, while yeast cream yields to the maximum in cell number.In the modeling part, we have built three models: Growth, Transcription-Translation and Bioabsorption.Besides, we can also find out whether our wet lab results conform to the modeling results.Considering the fact that proliferation is unhindered when resources are sufficient and minimal when resources have run out, our model couples growth (N) with resources (R).According to the results of modeling, you may predict what would happen under different conditions.Modeling also takes different forms, and the following is some examples of models:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This model is used widely.Modeling aims to build and use a model which provides a theoretical way to explain a phenomenon in a simpler fashion than the real situation.According to the previous research, PH and the resources play crucial roles on the growth of bacillus subtilis.In the second part, we compared the efficiency of three different promoters we use: Pveg, Ptas and Pcot and try to find which one has the highest efficiency.In spore state, bacillus subtilis is dormant and with strong resistance to the unfavorable conditions.[reference1] Referred to Logistic model, here are our equations.The experiment data shows that the number growth rate increases with PH increase when PH is lower than 7.0, but decreases with PH increase (>7.0).However, modeling plays an increasingly vital role in the research of synthetic biology.', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': 'As we have mentioned above, we need to construct 16 kits, which proved to be successful.(Figure 1)During the experiment, we utilized a constitutive promoter Pveg, a biobrick part coding for eGFP and two terminators.', 'safety': 'Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created.These have caused a lot of excitement in the pharmaceutical industry as they will be cheaper to produce, allow quicker production, as well enhance the knowledge of virology and immunology.The organisms we are dealing with are B. subtilis 168, B. subtilis NCIB3610 and E. coli K12.High security facilities are necessary when working with Synthetic Biology as there are possibilities of bioterrorism acts or release of harmful chemicals and or organisms into the environment.These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow.B. subtilis is the most studied gram-positive bacterium and a model organism in studying chromosome replication and cell differentiation.Synthetic vaccines are now being produced in the lab.So we plan to design an airtight container and totally enclosed process to control the engineered bacteria to escape into the environment.As for the experiments, the experiments are mainly in the molecular level, so the risks are caused by the reagents we used.With the potential future creation of man-made unicellular organisms, some are beginning to consider the effect that these organisms will have on biomass already present.Scientists estimate that within the next few decades, organism design will be sophisticated enough to accomplish tasks such as creating biofuels and lowering the levels of harmful substances in the atmosphere.For example, FDA stated that enzymes derived from it were in common use in food and that nontoxic and nonpathogenic strains of B. subtilis have been used in a variety of food applications.They also argue that the development of these organisms will simply shift the consumption of petroleum to the utilization of biomass in order to create energy.Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health.These organisms can harm existing life by affecting the prey/predator food chain, reproduction between species, as well as competition against other species (species at risk, or act as an invasive species).E. coli is the most studied and utilized bacteria in synthetic biology.However, the engineered bacteria may be released into the real world.B. subtilis and substances derived from it have been evaluated by different authorities about their safe and beneficial use in food.After collecting and sterilizing, the bio- or chemical wastes will be recycled by professional chemical recycling staffs in our institute respectively.A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.During our research, we carried out experiments within the biosafety guidelines established by WHO.', 'keywords': 'U n k n o w n', 'track': 'Environment', 'part_favorite': 'BBa_K1701004',

family and friends for encouraging us when our experiments didn\x92t work.', 'background': '', 'description': 'Whereas if we do not provide the transporter and we provide the protease, the adhesion will be cleaved and the bacteria will disperse the biofilm.This allows to introduce genes for both the formation and the dispersion of biofilm under the control of an expression system that responds to a desired regulation.However, this will not be enough to ensure a non-dispersal biofilm, and definitely it will not ensure that the biofilm that is formed will be more robust and grow faster or higher than a regular biofilm, which is our main goal in order to obtain a strong and regulated biofilm for bioremediation purposes.In addition, as the system is inducible by an external signal, it will be easy to control the precise moment of the production, so the bacteria are not induced to produce when the biomass is still too low or they are not forming a biofilm.Thanks to the biobrick format, this project is modular, and different genes can be exchanged in order to consume or produce a wide variety of products, taking advantage of the biofilm properties.Finally, the demand of propionate is rising every year, therefore the biotechnological production of it would be an interesting option.However, this is only an example of what our production system could do, as it has a modular concept in which some of the parts can be exchanged.The following figure shows the genes that are necessary in order to produce propionate from the central metabolism:Figure 4.To manipulate this, we will make use of a phosphodiesterase (PDE), that will destroy the c-diGMP, and a diguanilate cyclase (DGC), that will produce it, YhjH and PleD* respectively.These four genes, lapC, lapG, yhjH, and pleD*, allow us to control the formation and dispersion of the biofilm, to enhance it and make it stronger, and to be able to induce it whenever we want to.In this way, we are going to put the biofilm genes under the control of a flip-flop system, in order to induce biofilm when we have enough biomass in the reactor, and disperse it at the end of the production cycle.Thanks to our modular system and the biobrick format, the genes for different metabolic pathways can be inserted in our biofilm-forming, glycerol-eating bacterium, in order to be able to produce any compound of interest.Propionate is the salt of propionic acid, which consists of three carbon atoms with a carboxylic group.Increase in the biodiesel production, which leads to glycerol accumulation.Because of this, we thought that it may be a good idea to feed our bacteria with glycerol.Besides, the dispersal could not be entirely satisfactory, as there exists a protein whose function is to retain LapG and prevent the proteolysis of the union of the adhesin.For these reasons, we decided to combine this control system with another one that regulated the biofilm in a metabolically level.The scpABC genes are obtained from an E. coli K12 operon, while the epimerase gene is obtained from Pseudomonas mosselii.As our final objective is to obtain an industrial strain that had all the abilities given by the different constructs, each of the constructs of this project needs to be expressed in a regulated manner, as it will be necessary to stablish a fine control.These constructions will be introduced in the genome of the bacteria by means of a miniTn7 device, a mini transposon that locates itself always in the same part of the genome, and that does not affect to the living conditions of the bacteria.The propionate genes will be under de control of an expression system inducible by salicylate.This bacterium is not able to form a biofilm, but if we provide a functional lapC gene, the accumulated adhesion LapA will be able to go out and the bacteria will be able to produce the biofilm.GlpK and GlpD are involved in the conversion of glycerol into molecules of the central metabolism.Once our bacterium can eat and use glycerol, the carbon and energy obtained from this source can be used to produce a wide range of compunds, such as plastics, propanediol, citric acid, propionate, or butanol.LapG is a periplasmic protease that participates in the biofilm dispersion process by cleaving adhesion proteins such as LapA.As we can see in the scheme, this molecule can regulate both the formation and dispersion of the biofilm, depending on the quantity of it that is present inside the cell.This flip-flop system is the same used five years ago by the team of our University, in which we have a first part that is induced by IPTG and a second one that is induced by an increase in the temperature.However, this adhesin is a really huge protein that has got several kilobases in the genome, and the genetic manipulation of it would be very difficult to achieve.Once we have that, we can improve the glycerol bioremediation!Glycerol is an alcohol of three carbon atoms, which is part of biomolecules such as phospholipids or triglycerides, and is also an important intermediate compound for the cell metabolism.There are two complementary systems; one depends on the di-c-GMP (DGC, diguanylate cyclase, and PDE, phosphodiesterase), and the other one controls the amount of adhesion proteins (LapC, which controls the LapA secretion, and LapG, which controls the LapA stability).LapA is the adhesin responsible of the adhesion of the bacteria to the surface during the biofilm formation process.This module includes the use of both structural and regulatory genes that participate in the biofilm formation cycles.This system will be implemented in Pseudomonas putida.The first idea that comes to our minds is that we can focus on the adhesin in order to detach the biofilm from the surface whenever we want it to be disperses, or give it to the bacteria from an inducible promoter to control the adhesion.It is widely used as a human and animal food preservative, as an intermediate in the production of plastics, pesticides and textiles, and also in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.It is present in the cells as propionyl-CoA, which is a product of the fatty acids beta-oxidation, and enters the central metabolism by being converted to succinate.This increase in the glycerol generation has led to a fall in prices and its accumulation (Figure 2).A lot of different products can be easily produced and secreted by the microorganisms, as propionate, plastics, butanol, citric acid...Our project is based on biofilms, communities of bacteria that protect themselves from external factors by an exopolysaccharides coat.This system is part of a cascade, that will highly increase the production of the different genes of the operon, allowing a huge production of the product we desire to obtain.In addition, it is also easy to perform deletion mutants in this species, fundamental to one of the branches of the manipulation of the biofilm.In the Figure 1 you can see the regulation system that controls the induction and dispersion of biofilms in Pseudomonas putida:Figure 1.We decided to modify Pseudomonas putida so it will form and disperse the biofilm at our will, and afterwards we have modified them in order to increase and optimise the consumption of glycerol, as well as introduce some genes in it so it can produce propionate.If we could find the way to increase its consumption of glycerol, we will be ending with a huge problem of environmental pollution, as well as feed our production system.For this end, we have produced a P. putida strain that has a knock-in with gene glpF.Pseudomonas putida is a GRAS (Genetically Regarded As Safe) organism, what means that it is completely safe, even for its release to the environment.Regulation of the biofilm formation and dispersion.LapC is an essential protein for the secretion of adhesion proteins (such as LapA) that are involved in the biofilm formation process.This bacterium already has all the genes needed for the assimilation of glycerol, but they are repressed in the absence of this molecule.This gene is an aquaporine that specifically helps to the entrance of glycerol inside the cell, as we can see in the Figure 3.Figure 3.ScpABC and Epimerase are the proteins which we will be using for our artificial pathway.We have designed an artificial way, which can be seen in the next figure.It is therefore urgent to find another way to use this product, so the excess of glycerol is removed from the environment and used in other industries.Some of the current options are its use in animal feeding or as a solvent for chemical and enzymatic reactions.By cloning glpF under the control of another promoter, this problem can be easily solved.This decision was made in order to have appropriate growing conditions.The glycerol genes will be under a constitutive promoter, as the objective is to remove the maximum amount of glycerol we are able to.Besides, its genome has been completely sequence, and there exist many useful tools to manipulate its genetics, as it is the case of the miniTn7 device.Propionate itself is only common in some bacterial groups such as Propionibacterium, which get energy from the propionic fermentation process.For this purpose, we used a molecular ON/OFF switch which is regulated by a simple compound, salicylate.A biofilm is a community of bacteria that have attached to a surface and between them, and that have produced an extracellular matrix made out of polysaccharides.This type of fermentation uses an anaerobic pathway using the inverse reactions of the Krebs cycle, and produces propionate from the central metabolism.Currently, propionate is produced by chemical synthesis.These four genes will be the responsible for the construction of the pathway.Figure 6.Metabolic pathway of the glycerol uptake and incorporation in the central metabolism.', 'design': 'When GlpF was produced from a salicylate inducible expression system, this strain reached higher growth rates than the wild type when using glycerol as the sole carbon source.On the other hand, we know that P. putida is able to form biofilms.Crude glycerol obtained from the biodiesel industry is constantly added to a continuous bioreactor, where it is converted to an useful molecule by action of biofilms.This way, we convert a waste to a useful molecule in a profitable manner.Other conversions systems have been developed in order to use the crude glycerol from the biodiesel industry.In order to take advantage of this ability of the biofilms to degrade glycerol in higher rates, we have also genetically modified this bacterium to control the formation and dispersal of the biofilm.The ultimate goal of this project is to have a bioreactor in which bacteria form biofilms on the surfaces of the tank when activated, consume glycerol (the input) and disperse at will when the bioreactor needs to be cleaned.For that reason, many researchers have focused on looking for new ways to use that crude glycerol and avoid its accumulation in the environment (for more information, see Integrated Human Practices).To help solving that problem, the UPO Sevilla Team has developed a modified bacterium that is able to assimilate glycerol in a most efficient way.Glycerol is a by-product of the biodiesel industry.However, we have increased the glycerol consumption by two complementary ways: by increasing the entrance of the molecule in the bacteria and by using biofilms.To solve that problem, we have integrated a gene coding for an inner membrane glycerol transporter in the genome of P. putida.That way, I hope to eliminate glycerol from the environment in higher rates compared to other conversion systems.For that reason, we have genetically modified this bacterium in order to increase the assimilation of glycerol.Metabolic pathway modeling performed by our team predicts that the limiting step for glycerol assimilation is its transport across the cell membrane.Using glycerol as a carbon source, bacteria can produce another molecule with added value.The need to search for alternative renewable energy sources and the increase in the biodiesel production has led to the release of large quantities of glycerol.We make use of Pseudomonas putida, a bacterium that is able to degrade glycerol.', 'human_practice': 'In this event, we did not only get to know the projects, but we also were able to appreciate the great work that the groups were doing.The initiative came from iGEM group of Valencia, who contacted us and the iGEM team from Barcelona.We felt really delighted and integrated when interacting with the different disciplines that make up a team, from biotechnologists and biomedical scientists or computer engineers, to a journalist.Thanks to this meeting of different teams, we all made good friends and we are now a great family where everyone helps each other.Our university conducted a workshop on legumes entitled "Legumes, much more than a food" located in Plaza Nueva, next to the City Hall in Seville.We took advantage of the occasion by distributing brochures with information about iGEM, about synthetic biology and about our project in an attempt to bring it closer to people who have no idea about this field.For us, the influence of people and their interest in new scientific projects is a huge breakthrough.During the event presentations from experts they were divided into the following sessions:It was a unique experience that allowed us to discuss our project and the way we conducted experiments with people experienced in the field.The European Researchers  Night is a European science project promoted by the European Commission within the Marie Curie Sktodowska the Horizon 2020 program, which takes place simultaneously in over 250 European cities since 2005.For the fifth consecutive year, it was held in order to enhance the human side of research through direct contact and conversation with experts.As we didn\x92t know the city, our friends from Valencia were our guides and told us a lot of interesting historical information and some ancient legends of Valencia (such as the bat logo of the city).Another surprise was a picnic that the team from Valencia had prepared for all of us.Each part of the project was explained by a different member.It was very interesting to know the use of biomechanics and biomedicine to create transgenic plants using a novel and much more efficient technique .Our group was the second one to present the project.We talked about our project, and also explained the techniques we make use of to fulfil our goals.The scientific sessions took place in the hotel Silken Al-Andalus Palace.This event organized by the group of Molecular Microbiology of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM), has a totally educational and academic purpose.Apart from students, we were glad to explain our project to tourists, teachers and professors from different fields, parents, children and curious walkers.Although we belong to the Universidad Pablo de Olavide, this time we could have our own space due to the magnitude and recognition of our project.We were chatting for a few weeks until we agreed on a date for the meeting, which was not hard.The other groups gave them some ideas to help them improve their techniques.Once the presentations had finished, all group members met together and talked about what we thought about the other projects and how we could help each other.Sadly, we had to say goodbye at the train station.The 3 groups (UPO-Sevilla, UPF-CRG Barcelona and Valencia UPV) discussed constructively on different projects and applications and contributions to science.We had some very constructive talks for our projects and ourselves.After the presentations, all members of the group went out to have dinner together.They made a really fun show and we had a great time listening to their progress and difficulties on the creation of a probiotic to act as a preventive treatment for cancer.Specifically, the activity brought together more than 1,200 researchers to show their work to the public in the 2016 edition.We set up our stand next to the cathedral in the center of Seville, which is a really beautiful place.They were a little embarrassed to present their project because they thought it was not as good as the others.Until that time it was unknown to them, but now they are interested on our performance in the competition.As part of our meeting the IV Research Award BIOMEDAL a relevant research work in the field of Molecular Microbiology, as well as prizes for the best communications delivered.Several experts from the molecular microbiology sector participate in these meetings, making presentations on their work to help young researchers.This time the XI meeting was this time with Francis J.M.In these meetings, we combine the high scientific level of the Spanish Microbiology Society with an atmosphere of harmony and cordiality.Mojica (University of Alicante), who gave the inaugural lecture entitled "The growth curve CRISPR".Molecular Microbiology group is one of eleven specialized groups of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM), founded in 1946.It was a very nice surprise and the food was really tasty.In addition, we informed PhD students and other researchers about the iGEM competition.The purpose of the meeting was to know better the rest of the projects and the members from the other teams.On 30th th September, it was held on 7 Andalusian capitals and Jerez (Cadiz).The last year\x92s edition had the participation of 250 cities in 32 European countries with the aim of bringing science and researchers to the general public, proving that science and research can be fun and that it also related to everyday life, and promoting science communication among young people.The commitment of researchers is key for the success of the activity, which records an increasing number of scientists and scientists participating in the event each year.Last August (18, 19 and 20), the three Spanish iGEM groups met in the city of Valencia.The Eleventh Meeting of the Molecular Microbiology Group of the SEM (Sociedad Española de Microbiologia) in Sevilla, took place during the days 6th, 7th and 8th of September 2016.We finished the exhibition with a Spot of Human Practices.Finally, it was the turn of UPF-CRG Barcelona.The tradition was started in 1996 and continued with great success at subsequent meetings of the Group.', 'modeling': 'Right: Visualization of program s output instants after the first cell division.How bacterial consumption of the limiting substrate affects cell and biofilm growthThe velocity in wich, at a given point in time, each cell grows in length is proposed to be:Where v is the length growth rate of the bacteria in question, k is a proportionality constant, p represents the limiting substrate consumption rate by the cell, and L depicts its length.Therefore, the length growth rate of a bacterium is inversely proportional to its length.Note: This is not a real visualization of the program s output but a diagram.As a result of equations 1 and 2 and Fick s diffusion, each bacterium in the biofilm grows at its own time-dependent velocity, to reach the critical length and divide.The bacteria in the program are attracted to each other and to the solid wall, to reflect the action of adhesins (i.e LapA), which are transmembranal proteins that enable adherance to form a biofilm.However, it exists simultaneously a certain repulsion force, to emulate in this way the superficial tension of the cells and wall (Figure 4).At the same time, the position of each cell is also affected by thermal agitation-associated diffusion.Limiting substrate consumption rate equation.Where pmax corresponds to the maximum length growth rate per bacterial length unit, S is the limiting substrate concentration in the area surrounding the bacterium, and M depicts the limiting substrate concentration at which half of the maximum length growth rate is achieved.To model that bigger cells would uptake more limiting substrate than smaller cells, equation 2 shows that p is linearly dependent on the length of the bacterium (L).In this way, they are considered cylindrical tubes of length ranging from \x93L0\x94 to \x932L0 + ?\x94, with semi-spheres of radius \x93?/2\x94 at both ends (Figure 2 left).The software predicts the growth in size of the initial bacteria over time, until the cells reach the critical length (\x932L0 + 2?\x94).One of the simulations consists in a microscopic prediction of biofilm growth.As v depends on p and p is dependent on L, it is necessary in turn for v to be inversely proportional to L (equation 1).Initially, the limiting substrate is evenly distributed in the three dimensional space.However, bacterial consumption creates gradients of the limiting substrate.Schematic diagram representing how the bacteria consume the limiting substrate in the sub-area they are located.The intensity of the color is proportional to the limiting substrate concentration.The reason is that, for the purpose of enhancing biological activity in a bioreactor, biofilm induction is a pillar in the project.Specifically, two kinds of simulations regarding biofilm formation have been performed.However, the simulation models that bacterial length growth (v) is indepedent from the actual length of the bacterium.At the same time, the software includes standard Fick s diffusion equations to incorporate how these mass gradients spontaneously tend to disappear.Equations determining bacterial position, where rj and r? j indicate the projections of the positions of particle j along \x88 uj and along the directions perpendicular to \x88 uj, respectively; Fj and F? j are the parallel and perpendicular components of the forces, respectively; and R, R? 1 ,R? 2, R? 1 , and R? 2 are independent Gaussian random numbers of variance 1 and zero mean.Visualization of the software s final output.This causes that sub-area to reduce its limiting substrate concentration, and limiting substrate diffusion from neighbouring sub-areas occur.Starting with one bacteria, a biofilm has been generated.The prediction starts modelling a 3D liquid space in which one or more bacteria are attached to a solid wall.That is, how regions (referred to as "sub-areas" in figure 3) where less limiting substrate is present incorporate limiting substrate from adjacent regions by difussion.This causes cells to grow at lower velocities in regions where less limiting substrate is present.', 'notebook': 'Now, we name the construction of pleD* as pMRB145Electrophoresis

products far from heat and fire sources.Put the different wastes in the appropriated container.We also fulfill the two most important requirements in iGEM regarding biosafety: we only work with organisms from Risk Groups 1 or 2, and we completely avoid the release of genetically modified organisms and their products to the wild, by using containment protocols and sterilization of work material.These biofilm-forming bacteria will also be able to consume glycerol by expressing a glycerol transporter (glpF) with the same system, and they are also useful in order to produce many different compounds using that carbon source, such as propionate.Therefore, the main application of our bacteria is the industrial bioremediation and production of compounds.Our chassis bacterium, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, belongs to the Risk group 1 and is harmless and non-pathogenic for humans.The main risk about the use of a biofilm overproducing bacterium would be the transmission of biofilm production genes to other species, which could lead to the generation of highly resistant bacteria.The microorganisms we are using are not dangerous for human being, but there is a risk considering the presence of immunocompromised people.Therefore, the main actions we are taking are the containment of the biological material, the sterilization of the laboratory material, waste and work surfaces, and also to avoid the formation of aerosol particles that could lead to the spread of the bacteria.Our team registered two organisms in the check in, our main chassis organism (Pseudomonas putida KT2442) and Pseudomonas mosselii, from which we have obtained a part (epimerase) using gene synthesis technology.Responsible person for the safety of biology labs at our institution: Isabel Alonso Perez (+34 954977565, CABD).To avoid this, we do not use plasmid constructs, but our genes are stably inserted in the bacterial genome to avoid horizontal gene transfer, using the miniTn7 tool.The miniTn7 tool allows us to avoid many biosafety issues related to plasmid use, such as horizontal gene transfer or antibiotic selection (which can lead to resistance spreading); and it also makes our work much easier and simpler (avoids many problems related to plasmid stability, plasmid copy number and also provides the suitability to multiple bacterial hosts)If our project is completely finished and turns into a real product, the whole process can be developed in a biotechnological factory.Within the industrial applications, our modified strain is useful for the generation of products from bioremediation processes.You must read the safety specifications of the products you are going to use, including labels and safety cards.Keep the containers for chemical products closed and well organized.Avoid the inhalation of chemicals.This center belongs to the Spanish Public Administration and therefore fulfills all the national safety requirements.After we started our work, our team instructors and lab technicians provided us safety training.The use of lab coats and gloves is also mandatory in our lab.The UPO-Sevilla wet lab team uses the facilities of the Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo (CABD).This avoids biosafety issues such as the uncontrolled activity of exogenous genes and the harmful effect of an accidental release to the environment.Since we are working with genetically modified organisms, one risk is the release of these to the environment.Some of our safety guidelines are:Eating, drinking and smoking in the laboratories is forbidden.Use of security glasses, the use of contact lenses is not recommended.You must know the location and use of safety showers and fire extinguishers.', 'keywords': 'bacteriocins

2006).Conservation of functional residues within eukaryotic and putative bacterial CDOsAlso in 2013, the paper \x93Discovery of a substrate selectivity motif in amino acid decarboxylases unveils a taurine biosynthesis pathway in prokaryotes\x94 publish that the sequence, structural, and mutational analyses of the structurally and sequentially related hCSAD and human glutamic acid decarboxylase (huGADL) enzymes revealed a three residue substrate recognition motif, within the active site that is responsible for coordinating their respective preferred amino acid substrates.Mammalian cysteine metabolism and Hypotaurine formation in mitochondria.However more experiments about the taurine and hypotaurine production and function have been carried out in eukaryotic organisms.In 2006 a study of in vivo production of taurine, hypotaurine and sulfate following subcutaneous administration of L-cysteinesulfinate (CSA) to rats and mice indicate that liver is the most active tissue for taurine production, followed by kidney, also that external CSA, hypotaurine and taurine are easily taken up by these tissues (Nakamura, Yatsuki & Ubuka, 2006).In 2008, in an investigation of the hypotaurine production from L-cysteinesulfinate in rat liver mitochondria was indicated the presence of L-cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase activity and the possibility of antioxidant roles of cysteine metabolites like hypotaurine (Ubuka, Okada & Nakamura, 2008).In 2010, in the publication \x93Enhancement of menadione stress tolerance in yeast by accumulation of hypotaurine and taurine: co-expression of cDNA clones, from Cyprinus carpio, for cysteine dioxygenase and cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\x94, taurine was used as a compatible solute for stress tolerance of yeast, isolation of cDNA clones for genes encoding enzymes involved in biosynthesis of taurine was attempted.We chose this project because the idea has not been developed yet using synthetic biology and because of the market potential that has emerged around taurine.There are several ways in which hypotaurine is biosynthesized from cysteine, but the simplest and shortest one found was the one that acts via oxidation of cysteine with the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), followed by the decarboxylation of cysteinesulfinate using the enzyme cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) to produce hypotaurine.When the genetically modified E. coli is cultured in a cysteine-rich medium these enzymes will be in charge of catalyzing the reaction to produce hypotaurine, which leads to the opportunity to the production, purification and commercialization of this precursor of taurine.Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO, 2 EC 1.13.11.20) is a non-heme mononuclear iron metalloenzyme that catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) with addition of molecular oxygen.The plasmids shown below have different purposes, like only for the expression of the required enzymes, and plasmids that codify the sequence with poly his-tag to ease the purification of CDO and CSD.Figure N° 1. pSB1C3 with the construct for constitutive expression of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD).Figure N° 2: pSB1C3 with the construct for constitutive expression of CDO enzyme with a poly-his tag attached downstream to ease the protein purification.For this device (BBa_K2004009), both enzyme sequences were joined to a RBS sequence (BBa_J61101) at the 5\x92 side, a constitutive promoter sequence (BBa_J23106) upstream at the 5\x92 end and a double terminator sequence (BBa_B0012) downstream at the 3\x92 end.Furthermore, we have noticed that protein purification is an essential step to further experiments and analysis of the system behavior, because of this we decided to fuse the optimized enzyme sequences (CDO and GADL) with another registered part which is a poly his tag (BBa_K844000) designed by iGEM12_Utah_State team.A culture with a proper expression of the CDO construct (BBa_K2004011), will be green because the reporter gene located downstream of this sequence, which codifies to Green fluorescent protein (GFP).Meanwhile, the CSAD construct (BBa_K2004012) will produce this enzyme and a pink chromoprotein because both gene sequences are together next to its constitutive promoter.This enzyme has a length of 200 aminoacids and a mass of 22,972 Daltons (UniProt, 2005).The product of the reaction catalyzed by CDO, cysteine sulfinic acid, is either decarboxylated to hypotaurine, which is further oxidized to taurine by a poorly understood mechanism, or transaminated to the putative intermediate 3-sulfinylpyruvate that spontaneously decomposes to pyruvate and sulfite, with sulfite being further oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase.CDO is one of the most highly regulated metabolic enzymes responding to diet that is known (Stipanuk et al., 2008).CDO is known to be expressed in the brain, kidney, and lung, with significantly high levels in liver tissue, where this enzyme has an important role in maintaining the hepatic concentration of intracellular free cysteine (Ye et al., 2007).It is believed that CDO is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson and Alzheimer, and also in autoimmune diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, due to its function in regulating free cysteine levels (Ye et al., 2007).Two types of cDNA clones corresponding to genes encoding cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1 and CDO2) and a cDNA clone for cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase (CSD) were isolated from Cyprinus carpio.Although there are no records of iGEM teams who have worked with the direct bioproduction of taurine or hypotaurine, some teams have used them as precursors for other purposes in their projects.Dominy, J., Simmons, C., Karplus, P., Gehring, A., & Stipanuk, M. (2006).The cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase enzyme (CSAD), also known as sulfoalanine decarboxylase, is an enzyme involved in the hypotaurine biosynthesis.Figure N° 4: These constructs ease the identification of the respective enzymes because contains the sequence attached a reporter gene, GFP with CDO and SPISPINK with CSAD.Figure N° 5: Assembly shown above contain the sequences for a modified and improved version of the chromoprotein Spis Pink designed by BIOSINT_Mexico 2015 iGem team.The same happened with the GADL sequence to codify the CSAD enzyme, which is part of the Homo sapiens sequence; this sequence has been widely used in a experimental way to study the expression of this enzyme by using microorganism, so we cleaned up the sequence of restriction enzymes, optimize the sequence to be used into E. coli ((BBa_K2004008).This device (BBa_K2004013) allows to test the fusion, because contains a constitutive promoter and a RBS upstream and the double terminator downstream.In order to get as a final result, the hypotaurine production, both enzymes CDO and CSAD must be together.A similar protein in rodents plays a role in multiple biological processes as the rate-limiting enzyme in taurine biosynthesis, catalyzing the decarboxylation of cysteine sulfinate to hypotaurine.Figure N° 3: pSB1C3 with the construct of constitutive promoter, CDA enzyme sequence with a poly-his tag attached downstream to ease its purification.It should be noted that the sequence used to the pink chromoprotein is a new and improved version of SpisPink part (BBa_1684000) designed by iGEM BIOSINT_Mexico 2015 team.In this way, a brief step to confirm the chromoprotein expression is purifying it, so to facilitate this process we fuse a improved version of the sequence (BBa_K2004004) that codifies to pink chromoprotein with another registered part, the poly his tag (BBa_K844000).The last version of this chromoprotein(BBa_K1684000), designed by the previous Biosint team, was analyzed according to its sequence and all the parameter that must meet to be part of a standardized biobrick.Meanwhile device in the right side is the chromoprotein with a poly-his tag attached downstream for a better protein purification.Several devices were designed with different purposes, some of them just correspond to the protein expression, CDO and CSAD, meanwhile other devices were built for help the protein purification and the protein expression identification in the wet lab by using chromoproteins like reporters.Recuperado el 27 de marzo de 2016, de http://www.javeriana.edu.co/Facultades/Ciencias/neurobioquimica/libros/neurobioquimica/taurina.htmIn 2006 were identified four proteins from Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Streptomyces coelicolor A3 that shared low overall identity and conserved important active-site residues to the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) which provides important oxidized metabolites of cysteine such as sulfate and taurine.Amino Acids, 35(1), 53-58. doi:10.1007/s00726-007-0633-xThis project aims to bioengineer E. coli in order to produce hypotaurine, the predecessor of taurine.From L-cysteine metabolism to be converted in 3-Sulfino-L-alanine to finally convert this substrate in Hypotaurine.Below are shown different constructs the team designed to ease the identification of a functional device, or right expression of the enzymes.In this way, there are two new modified parts, the first is BBa_K2004002, the fusion between CDO (BBa_K2004007) with Polyhis tag, and the respective constitutive promoter, RBS and double terminator.For carry out this project, we took the CDO1 sequence from Enterobacter aerogenes and we optimized the sequence to be able to express a functional enzyme in Escherichia coli (BBa_K2004007), besides the sequence was cleaned up of whatever restriction site, that is not part of the BBF RFC 10, that could generate troubles with the standard 3A Assembly.The hypotaurine is the key intermediate for taurine synthesis, it´s an obligatory precursor leading to taurine but also it has been proposed that hypotaurine may act as an antioxidant, although the mechanism of the oxidation of hypotaurine is not fully understood.The enzyme responsible of the transformation of hypotaurine to taurine, hypotaurine dehydrogenase has not been totally identified in some tissues, thus, some researchers suggest that the conversion may be nonenzimatic or either spontaneously.Brain, lung and sexual tissue contain high levels of hypotaurine, there is evidence to support that it can protect these cells from oxidative damage during hypotaurine quenching of carbon or oxygen-based free radicals can itself react with oxygen, removing dissolved oxygen from the microenvironment undergoing oxidative stress.Taurine and hypotaurine are closely linked.Hypotaurine differs from taurine only in the oxidation state of the sulfur center and the resulting change in the acidity of the molecule.The second device BBa_K2004010 is the corresponding to the GADL1 sequence, in the same conditions, assembled with its constitutive promoter, RBS and double terminator.Recent experimental data have shown that hypotaurine reacts rapidly and efficiently with the hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, and hydrogen peroxide.An Insight into the Mechanism of Human Cysteine Dioxygenase: KEY ROLES OF THE THIOETHER-BONDED TYROSINE-CYSTEINE COFACTOR.An important paralog of this gene is DDC.GADL1 encodes a member of the group 2 decarboxylase family.Most metabolic pathways give hypotaurine as a precursor to taurine.For this it was used PSI-BLAST searches and crystallographic information about the active-site geometry of mammalian CDOs.The device in the left correspond to the current chromoprotein sequenced with an improved stop site to end the transcription process.Figure shown above explains how the entire system works.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'Due to the fact that in the country most of the people tends to emit judgments without really having the correct information, the misinformation of the overall population (including workers of the public sector such as governors, senators and mayors) is the regular/normal situation day a day and nothing seems to be changing, at least in the short term set.Therefore, we\x92ve been implementing a couple of activities where we can explain and instruct the generations soon to be graduated from high school and college freshmen what is Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology and the high spectrum of applications they offer: this through a series of workshops where they are shown how to use certain softwares for plasmid assembly and gene blocks constructions, as well as simulations of DNA replications and all the machinery involved in these kind of processes; and a mini-summer camp where they are exposed to all the things Tec de Monterrey is doing in its science faculty in campus Queretaro, where the schools of Biotechnology, Agronomy and Food Science Engineering try to develop new sustainable projects in order to help the community and give it the much needed tools to improve old fashion techniques of production of any kind of bioproduct that are harmful to the environment, non efficient or more wasteful of resources (especially in a part of Mexico where the climate seasons tend to be a bit harsh and there\x92s a severe problem with water supply and usage).The camp consisted on a series of conference talks from different professors of the university, lab workshops imparted by members of the Biosint_Mexico team, and of course several outdoor activities.Undoubtedly the support and collaboration between different institutions and iGEM team is vital to achieve this goal; there are many problems that arise throughout the development of the project to meet all the objectives; in this case the Guanajuato_Mx team, with all their encourage decided to participate in the annual version of Interlab Study, nevertheless, its iGEM kit was unfortunately not given them, so this study could hardly do.Finally, although it was a mutual effort to achieve results, different conditions make it impossible to get them; however, the collaboration was always the best intentions of continuous improvement between the teams.Guanajuato_Mx, thank you for allowing us to work with you and make us participants in these activities, It will be always a pleasure to participate in this kind of stuff whose sole intention is to spread the knowledge in the best way possible, making friends.As we have been doing for over the past two years, our team tries to continue to leave a mark in the education and information of the teenager generations here in Mexico.Fortunately for both teams, we were able to be in contact and because BIOSINT_Mexico did have its kit, with great spirits was given them the necessary material, to perform their Interlab Experiment and still participate in the study.This team is made up of students from different universities, who with the intention of starting their experience in this competition, they decided to join efforts to carry out their project.Competition from synthetic biology, iGEM, is not only based on the successful completion of the main idea of ??the project, but also has other areas of knowledge in which the teams must approach, the development of ethical attitudes and free spreading information are some of them, as well as integration between different teams.This time the

requirements to be fulfilled in order to do the following: creating and establishing a pilot plant that is capable of reproducing the lab experiment.This project had the specific intention of realize an estimation of the costs that a person will incur if he/she/they were planning to develop the iGEM Biosint_Mexico 2016 project at a semi-industrial scale.The CDO and CSAD lines overlap, as we assumed they are translated and degraded at the same rate.As we can see in the plot, in this simulation the enzyme concentration increases until it stabilizes at 90.9 nM, and there is no change in the cysteine concentration until CDO and CSAD have been produced.However, the code includes comments for changing this easily.This model can be seen as a template which describes how the system would work in general, and can easily be edited to improve it with Michaelis-Menten kinetics if the enzymes are characterized to get a more accurate representation.Below is a plot of how the system would behave with an initial cysteine concentration of 1000 nM.- Shipping cost for the reagents and materials(if the company settle down in Querétaro México).As part of the objectives the Biosint_Mexico team have, this pilot plant will be a microbiological fermentation unit capable of produce and extract hypotaurine for the enrichment of other food products, energetic beverages and food supplements.This simulation uses the parts and compositors MATLAB framework developed at MIT for the \x93Principles of Synthetic Biology\x94 edX course.The equations used to describe all reactions are based on the law of mass action, using estimated rate constants.We developed a MATLAB simulation in order to model how the system and concentrations would change through time.It includes the essential elements required to provide an overview of the net flow the company will be exposed to, such as: costs of all types, prices of every material/equipment/space and the initial monetary investment in order to start a company of this kind.This after find out that the molecule in question is highly used in the animals food industry as well as in the beverages ones.The two enzymatic reactions would be better modeled with Michaelis-Menten equations, but we could not find characterization information for our two specific enzymes, and therefore the simpler mass action equation was used with a single rate constant.', 'notebook': 'Undoubtedly the support and collaboration between different institutions and iGEM team is vital to achieve this goal; there are many problems that arise throughout the

near future, it will be applied to tackle with the problem of white pollution.This year, we aimed to degrade PET, which is a kind of pollution source, with our modified enzymes PETase and MHETase.', 'modeling': 'Finally, we can get the unstable diffusion differential equation while the enzymes near the cells are secreted along direction r.$$frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} = Dfrac{1}{{{r^2}}}frac{partial }{{partial r}}({r^2}frac{{partial E}}{{partial r}}) + {r_E}$$Integrate the equation above then we can get the distribution equation of the enzyme concentration.If we use the diffusion rate equation, the rate of enzyme diffusion from cells to liquid phase body can be described as:[frac{{d{E_x}}}{{dt}} = {k_c}{a_c}({E_c} - {E_x})]Mass transfer process of enzymes from liquid phase to the surface of PETSimilar to the process of diffusion from cells to liquid body, based on Fick\x92s first law and mass conservation we can get the differential equation of the diffusion process.$$frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} = D(frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {x^2}}} + frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {y^2}}} + frac{{{partial ^2}E}}{{partial {z^2}}}) + {r_E}$$If we integrate the formula above, we can get the distributing equation of the enzyme concentration.Similarly with the diffusion rate equation, the equation of the rate of enzyme diffusion from liquid to PET surface can be obtained:$$frac{{d{E_p}}}{{dt}} = {k_p}{a_p}({E_x} - {E_p})$$The total diffusion equation of the process can be described as:$$frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = Ka({E_c} - {E_p} - Delta E)$$The loss of driving force of mass transfer caused by the enzyme concentration accumulation in the liquid phase.Assuming that the diffusion process in liquid phase is a dynamic balancing process, which means the concentration variation in the liquid phase body is equal to the rate of enzyme production, it can be describe as:$$frac{{d{E_c}}}{{dt}} - {r_E} = frac{{d{E_P}}}{{dt}}$$[frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = frac{{({E_c} - {E_x}) - frac{{{r_E}}}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + ({E_x} - {E_p})}}{{frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + frac{1}{{{k_p}{a_p}}}}}]So the relationship between the parameters in total mass flux equation and those in interphase mass flux equation is:$$frac{1}{{Ka}} = frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}} + frac{1}{{{k_p}{a_p}}}$$As we can see, the total resistance for enzymes in liquid phase is the resistance from cell surface to liquid phase body plus that from liquid to PET surface.As a result, the most of the resistance for enzyme transfer in liquid phase is that from liquid to PET surface, which can be described as:[frac{1}{{Ka}} = frac{1}{{{k_c}{a_c}}};;;;;K approx frac{{{k_c}{a_c}}}{a}]After secreted by cells, enzymes diffuse to the surface of PET through liquid phase.In the process of mass tranfer, enzyme concentration in liquid phase will be balanced with that on the surface of cells and that on the surface of PET.Thus some enzymes will remain in liquid phase body.And the mass transfer process will lead to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface.This can be expressed by the equation below: [int_t^{t + T} {Ka({E_c} - {E_P} - Delta E)dt = {E_c} - {E_P}} ] The equation above is an integral equation.Corresponding differential equation is:[Ka[frac{{dT}}{{dt}}Delta E(t + T) - Delta E(t)] = frac{{Delta E(t)}}{{dt}}]Intergrate this equation and we get the relation between delay time T and time:The process of PETase adsorbing on PET surface and enzymes catalyzing PET degradationThe biodegradation of polymer by enzymes is a kind of heterogeneous enzymatic reactions.So the rate of degradation of polymer, the absorbed enzyme amount, the inactive combined enzyme mount, the density of ester bond on polymer surface and the superficial area have the following relation:[v = - frac{{d{n_{exp }}}}{{dt}} = A cdot {k_2} cdot {\rho _{EB}}({q_E}A - {n_E})]Connecting with the absorption balance and the substrate restrain balance, we can get the total rate of degradation equation:[v = {k_2}{\rho _{EB}}(frac{{{K_A}[E]{q_{{E_{max }}}}A}}{{1 + {K_A}[E]}} - {K_A}{K_B}{[E]^2}[P] cdot V)][[E] = frac{{[{E_P}]}}{{1 + {K_A} + {K_A}{K_B}[P]}}]The concentration of enzymes on the plastic surfaceBecause the concentration of enzyme is low in the system and the producing rate of MHET is equal to the rate of PET degradation, we can get the following formula:[, - frac{{d{n_{exp }}}}{{dt}} = frac{{Vd[P]}}{{dt}}]Considering that MHET in substrate restrain is easy to diffuse to liquid, which means the balance is small, we can get the final equation for plastic degradation:[v = frac{{d[P]}}{{dt}} = frac{{{k_2}{\rho _{EB}}}}{V}(frac{{{K_A}[EP]{q_{{E_{max }}}}A}}{{1 + {K_A} + {K_A}{K_B}[P]}} - frac{{{K_A}{K_B}{{[{E_P}]}^2}[P]}}{{{{(1 + {K_A})}^2}}})]The above equation is differential whose only variable is the concentrate of MHET.Connecting these two factor with the above total equation and substitute constants we can get:[v = frac{{c[EP](t - T)}}{{d + e[P](t)}} - f{([EP](t - T))^2}[P](t)]The concentration on PET surface is a function of time t-TSolve the above equation, then we get the curves of PET degradation rate in heterogeneous phase.From the figure above , the change of degradation rate can be divided into three stages no matter if there is liquid transmission.The mass transfer of enzymes in the liquid phase will cause some of them to stay in the liquid body and the delay of enzyme concentration changes on the PET surface.Based on the assumptions above and the description of PET degradation process in a heterogeneous system, we first establish the equation of measuring how much percent the PET degrades and how much the degrading rate is.We construct models for each step and finally deduce the rate curve of PET degradation by the enzymes secreted by bacteria in heterogeneous system.From this curve we can see that the degradation can be devided into 3 parts.In the first part, degradation rate is under the control of bacteria growth and enzyme secretion.In the second part, it is controlled by the mass transfer of enzyme in the liquid phase.In the third part, it is controlled by the catalytic ability of enzymes adsorbed on the PET surface .From the trend of the curve we can conclude that, in order to degrade PET with a higher rate or make the rate peak as soon as possible,what we first need to do is to promote the growth of bacteria.This will enhance the enzyme concentration.On the other hand, we can accelerate the diffusion of enzymes in the liquid phase.For example,shake cultivation or stirred culture,can eliminate the influence of time delay and make the degradation rate reach the peak fast.Our system assumes that PET degradation only takes place on the surface of PET.Although it s reasonable,as the degradation proceeds, small gaps will form on the plastics due to degradation.If they become so large that enzymes can diffuse into the interior of PET,degradation process will be accelerated to a huge extent.The next step of building models is to take the process and threshold value of internal diffusion into consideration.This will provide a more accurate model to describe the process of PET degradation in the heterogeneous system.Combining with the fraction of coverage we can get:[\theta = frac{{{q_E}}}{{{q_{{E_{max }}}}}} = frac{{{K_A}[E]}}{{1 + {K_A}[E]}}]Establishment of equation for rate of total degradation of PETAfter absorption to the surface, the combination and escape is a dynastic balancing process because of the competitive substrate.The enzymatic degradation is interfacial reaction before degradation in large scale.The whole process can be described in the following equation:[{r_x} = frac{{d{c_x}}}{{dt}} = {mu _m}{c_x}(1 - frac{{{c_x}}}{{{c_x}_m}})]Specific growth rate , namely the growth rate of a unit thalli concentrationWhen cells are in exponential phase, ? is generally a constant,soUnder the condition when t=0, cx=cx0, we integrate the formula above:[{c_x} = frac{{{c_x}_0{c_x}_m{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_x}_m - {c_x}_0(1 - {e^{{mu _m}t}})}}]Solve this equation and the growth curve can be obtained:The formation dynamics of expression product (PETase)The extreme diversity of metabolites produced by microbial fermentation and the complexity of biosynthesis routes in the cells cause the biosynthetic pathways and metabolic regulation mechanism of those metabolites to show diverse characterisitics.Then we use the general method of describing mass transfer process to establish mass transfer rate equation when enzymes diffuse from the cell surface to liquid phase body then from liquid phase body to the PET surface, and the distribution equation of enzyme concentration, respectively.When ??0 and ??0, the model is partial-growth coupling.Plug the cell growth rate into the equation to simplify:[{r_E} = frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = {c_x} cdot left[ {alpha {mu _m}(1 - frac{{{c_x}}}{{{c_{xm}}}}) + \x08eta } \right]][E = alpha (frac{{{c_{x0}}{c_m}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_m} - {c_{x0}} + {c_{x0}}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}} - {c_{x0}}) + frac{{\x08eta {c_{xm}}}}{{{mu _{xm}}}}ln frac{{{c_{xm}} - {c_{x0}} + {c_{x0}}{e^{{mu _m}t}}}}{{{c_{xm}}}}]Solve this equation and the production curve of PETase can be obtained:Compared with the growth curve of bacteria, we can see intuitively that at the beginning, the correlation between the enzymes production and the concentration of bacteria is high.Based on the stationary approximate theory, we can get the total dynamics equation.[\theta = frac{A}{{{A_0}}} = frac{{{q_E}}}{{{q_{{E_{max }}}}}}]The fraction of coverage by enzyme on the polymer surfaceThe content of absorption for enzyme per area on polymerBecause enzymatic catalytic step is a rete controlling step, the absorption on polymer surface is a dynamic balancing process.Rate of absorption:[{r_1} = d[ES]/dt = {k_1}[E](1 - \theta );]Rate of desorption:[{r_2} = d[E]/dt = {k_{ - 1}}\theta ]From r1=r-1, we can get: k1[E] (1-?) = k-1?.Thus we choose the ester bond number as an index to evaluate this degradation process.The calculation formula for calculating the number of moles of ester bonds (namely the number of moles when polymers are completely degraded):$${n_{EB}} = {n_{EB/{M_{rep}}}} cdot m/{M_{rep}} $$ The mole number of the broken ester bonds in theory(?mol)The molar mass of the repeat units in the polymer(?g/?mol)The percentage of degradation of ester bonds can be obtained through that ratio.Similarly, the degrading rate can also be described by a series of formulas shown below:The Equation for The Growth Rate of Enzyme ProteinsAccording to the characterisitics of microbial cell growth, Monod Equation is the most commonly used one.In our experiment we use engineered bacteria as machines to secrete PETase to degrade PET.At first the bacteria secrete PETase ,and then enzymes diffuse into liquid phase body from the cell surface ,from liquid to the surface of PET successively.PETase adsorbs on PET during which process the substrate binding sites of PETase contact with the surface.Finally PETase finds catalytic sites on plastics and combine them with its active center.Ester bonds are broken and chains in PET are ruptured,resulting in the degradation of PET.1.Marge constants:[v = frac{{c[{E_P}]}}{{d + e[P]}} - f{[{E_P}]^2}[P]]From the above figure, the rate of degradation without competitive restrain is pretty lower than it with competitive restrain.But the rate get down gradually with substrate restrain.Solution of PET Degradation Rate Considering The Whole SystemSolution of PET degradation rate considering the process of cells secrete proteinWe have got the rate of enzyme production by connecting with the growth process of cells before.Solve the above differential equation, we can get the curves of the rate of PET degradation as following:From the above figure, enzymes get to the absorption balance and get the biggest rate of degradation.We analyze and then make a conclusion that the mass transfer diffusion mainly leads to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface .Finally, taking that MHET, the product of PET degradation, will show competitive inhibition effect into consideration, based on the adsorption equilibrium of PETase on the PET surface, we use the steady state approximation theory and deduce the total kinetic equation of PETase degrading PET.Finally, PET degradation rate settle out because of both the two factor, mostly because the absorption gets its saturation.Rate of the whole process for cells to secrete and degrade in heterogeneous phaseWe just calculated the enzymatic degradation rate while ignored the transmission in the liquid.The universal model can be expressed by Leudeking-Piret Equation:[{r_E} =

growth(g\x95g-1\x95h-1)When ??0 and ?=0, the model is growth coupling.From those equations we can get the total mass transfer rate equation of the enzymes in a heterogeneous system.So there are two transfer processes before the enzymes adsorp on the PET surface.The mass transfer process of enzymes in the liquid phase bodyCells secrete enzymes to the outside.The rate of mass imported from the inner surface:$${r_{imp}}{\rm{ = }}{j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2}$$The rate of mass output from the outside surface is:$${r_{exp }}{\rm{ = }}{j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2}{\rm{ + }}frac{{partial ({j_{{\rm{er}}}} cdot 4pi {r^2})}}{{partial r}}dr$$$${r_{acc}}{\rm{ = }}frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}} cdot 4pi {r^2}dr$$Rate of exported mass \x96 rate of imported mass + rate of accumulation \x96 producing rate = 0$$frac{{partial ({j_{er}}{r^2})}}{{partial r}} + frac{{partial E}}{{partial t}}{r^2} - {R_E} = 0$$$${j_{er}} = - Dfrac{{partial E}}{{partial r}}$$Substitute and sort this equation.Finally PET will desorb enzymes.Establishment of dynamics equation for PET enzymatic degradationAssuming that there is a bonding site and an active center in the enzyme, it combines with the substrate through its bonding site and then degrades the polymer with its active site.And with the time passing by the correlation becomes lower and finally disappears.The Transfer Process of Enzymes in The Liquid PhaseThe secretion of enzymes from cells will inevitably lead to the increase of enzyme concentration nearby.The resistance of enzymes\x92 spread from liquid body to the surface of PET is much larger than that of from the cells\x92 surroundings to liquid body.5.On the other hand, the enzymes in the liquid phase will reach the surface of PET along with the free diffusion of molecules.Enzymes will act with polymers through their bonding sites and combine with the substrate after their secretion and diffusion to the PET surface from cells.It takes several steps for the enzymes to complete the degradation of PET.The degradation of PET takes place on the surface of PET.7.Since the classical dynamics equation for enzymatic reaction, Michaelis-Menten equation, is based on homogeneous enzyme- substrate system, it\x92s not suitable to describe the process of the degradation of polymers.Solve this differential equation we obtain the degradation rate curve of PET under heterogeneous system.The Formulas for Calculating Biodegradation Percentage and The Degradation RateSince our project aims to degrade PET, we need to propose a stable index to measure the degree of degradation of the plastics and another one to measure the degradation rate.When there is competitive restrain, the change of degradation rate can be divided into three stages.Thus we utilize the Logistic Equation to describe the rhythm of the growth rate.Logisic model is a typical S-shaped curve that can reflect the inhibition effect caused by the increase of bacteria concentration in the fermentation process.In this system, the adsorption of enzymes on the PET surface will lead to the accumulation of the enzymes.That can be reasonable because absorption is just related to the concentration of enzyme on the PET surface.And when enzyme concentrations surrounding the cells are larger than that in the liquid phase body, a driving force will emerge, causing the diffusion of enzymes into liquid phase body.In this system the product molecules still contain ester bonds, as a result, MHET may act with the enzymes before its diffusion into the solution and restrain the combination between PET and PETase.We assume that the enzymes are firstly combined with the polymer substrate through their own substrate binding sites, and then the active centers catalyzed the degradation of the polymers.6.And the liquid transmission effect the second stage most, at which cells grow up and secret more.Here we choose to describe degradation rate and percentage.The role of PETase plays in the degradation is to catalyze the cleavage of ester bonds between TPA and EG.Then the enzymes catalyze to break the ester bonds, and the small molecules such as MHET will be released and diffuse into the liquid phase.Here a cell can be regarded as a sphere and there\x92s a spherical shell composed by the enzymes in the outer surface of the sphere.The transmission will lead to loss of the effective enzyme and latency of arrival for enzyme to PET surface.Through the above description of the process, the enzyme need to find an active segment to combine with.Second, the secretion controlling stage at which the secretion rate gets to saturation because of the saturation of cell growth.This competitive restraint will lead to a declination in the catalysis rate.Although this equation is considered to be simple and effective when used to describe the growth of bacteria, it is only suitable under the condition that there is no other restrictive substances in the environment.So the concentration gradient drops in the concentration field near the PET surface.There exists feedback inhibition regulation in the growing process of a single bacteria.Enzymes are in the dynamic equilibrium when transferring in the liquid phase.4.Enzymes have the substrate binding sites and active centers.', 'notebook': 'Bacterial consortium is one of the most creative ideas.',

iGEM(BBa_K1582000&BBa_K1582001).Our particular desigin is shown as follows.Hydrophobin is a small molecular weight protein produced by filamentous fungi, which is characterized by the ability to form a layer of amphiphilic protein membrane at the interface in order to reverse the nature of the interface covered.Utilized amphiphilic and high temperature, acid and alkali resistance characteristics of hydrophobic protein, co-display the PETase and hydrophobic protein on the surface of eukaryotic cells helps in greatly improving the enzyme activity and broaden the reaction conditions of the enzyme.Surface display can improve the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and avoid the trouble of protein purification.This year, we focus on solving the white pollution problem.Due to its amphiphilic nature, the hydrophobic protein binds to the surface of yeast cells spontaneously and binds the hydrophobic surface toward the extracellular side, which adsorbs the PET film through the hydrophobic interaction force.The yeast cell wall is hydrophilic while the hydrophobic protein is hydrophobic.Besides, we used the hydrophobic protein to modify the surface of reaction system to increase its activity.Hydrophobin amphipathicity refers to the hydrophobic nature that the hydrophilic end of a hydrophobin.Frist and the foremost, researchers should analyze the three-dimensional enzyme structure and understand its characteristic for well-directed proceeding to the next section.After that, the system was separated into two parts to improve its activity.The next step has two paths, one is directed mutation, which site is chosen by analyzing the three-dimensional protein structure to find its functional domains, and the other is surface display.According to its self-characteristic, people will do targeted modify on the enzyme in order to an extensive application.We understood more deeply the problem we were facing to solve and how to put the thoughts into reality to solve the white pollution.This time, we put forward a new system about enzymology called Training Protein.', 'human_practice': 'During the May, we have invite five professors to our forums to discuss with us about our project ideas.Fortunately, a few companies committed to the value of our project and wanted to support us.These events change our way of thinking, and help us have more comprehensive conclusion.Not only do we focus on the future education, but also chasing for a better achievement of our project.And according to our accomplishment with Training Protein System, the value of modified PETase canbe explored more.The talking gives us confident about our project.The best situation is the used microbe can be treated with sterilization reagent, and the soil has already have fungi, it will not be affected.The discussion let us realized that our PETase is vital for environment protection, but its not enough.Then, Tianjin Naipu Technology Co., Ltd suggested that they can provide us some PET samples and we can also go to their factory for a visit.When talking about our project, the manager said that the PETase is one of the best ways of PET degradation.He advised us to sum up the main steps of our experiment and put it into reality.Having listened to the opinions of the experts, we can better our project.And the one who affect us most is Professor Yang from Tianjin University, who is one of the leading experts in structure biology in China.Finally we use the bottles into our experiment as a connection of the lab and the reality.To expand the thought of our project, we go talk with professors and went for visit.Before we leaving, manager gave us some PET samples (plastic films and bottles) as a present.All the professors are have a large stock of knowledge and gave us many useful advises.To test and verify the new system, we put it in use of PETase and finally confirm that the system is valid.Polyethyleneterephthalate (PETPEIT) is the condensation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.After listen to our whole project idea, professor asked us, why don t we raise the idea up into a theory.The manager show us around and introduce the situation about the production, yield, the development of PET industry and so on.After a negotiations, opposite side promised us that we can go to their factory for a visit.After understand our main idea about PETase, the staff said, if our biological method is available, land using efficiency will be greatly accelerated.Additionally, we also harvest a lot of experience and deepen our understanding of our project when going out of school and contacting with workers and experts.During the event of looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained some sponsor fee from the society but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology.During the times, we are inspirited and come up with better ideas and results.In addition, some experts in companies talked with us very friendly and put forward useful suggestions for us although they did not provide financial support.It s believed that collecting the opinions and suggestions of some officials helped us to improve our project, making it more meaningful.We introduced the iGEM and our project to them and showed our sponsorship proposal in order to make them interested in our team, sponsor fees and provide experimental materials, technology support.', 'modeling': 'So we can get:According to our hypothesis, when the PET\x95S is decompose into the reaction products there will soon be a new PET binding on the PET film, so in the whole reaction process, the amount of the PETS won\x92t change at all, and we can get the differential equation being zero.and because of the assumptions as the reverse reaction rate is zero, so the constant valve of k6 is zero and the equation-14 can change into:The above differential equation is the final rate equation of the whole reaction process, and from the equation-15 we can see that the reaction rate is a constant, D. And the reaction rate constants were different at different PET concentrations and different PET films.As can be seen from the above reaction kinetics model, the whole reaction rate is a constant after reaching the adsorption equilibrium.Third, the effect of reaction area in the hydrolysis process can be well considered by taking the adsorption process into account.In this part, we choose the Langmuir isothermal adsorption equation to describe the first step in the reaction process, the combination of the PET film and the PET enzyme.We needn\x92t to take the reaction rate of the first reaction equation into account because it has been calculated in the adsorption part and the differential equation of the remaining two reaction rate as follows:so the following equation can be gotten by putting the relationship equation of the concentration of PET\x95S and the PET film\x92s area into the above differential equation:And combine the above equation and the equation of dimensionless Langmuir adsorption equation, we can get: Now, let\x92s analyze the parameters of the above equation.There are three reasons we choose two steps, adsorption and reaction, to describe the process of PET enzymatic hydrolysis reaction: First, the adsorption process has a greater impact on the PET enzymatic hydrolysis process which we can\x92t ignore.The general adsorption image of this equation in a typical solution is shown in picture 1:Here we assume that the PET enzyme adsorption process in accordance with the adsorption process in the picture above.It\x92s used in this situation as well, so the double reciprocal equation is:So if we have the experimental data by experimenting with quartz crystal microbalance to detect the adsorption capacity of PET, we can get the constant ?max and Ka through the equation above.b. Schematic diagram of the combination of the PET enzyme and reaction products while the hydrolysis reaction is happening.When the enzyme adsorbed on the PET film is released after the reaction, a new PET enzyme will be adsorbed on the PET immediately from the picture 2, so the adsorption equilibrium is not broken.At last, the third step is the hydrolysis reaction and the three-step reaction equations as follows:In the above equation, the meaning of each symbol represents as follows: PET\x95S: The middle state of PET enzyme adsorption on the surface of PET sheet.In order to apply this equation to solve the reaction kinetics problem well, some assumptions are given follows: B.The adsorption of PET enzyme on the PET-solid-surface is monomolecular layer.While, in fact, the product of the hydrolysis reaction, BHET and MHET shown a competitive inhibition of the hydrolytic activity of PET enzyme against PET sheet, which would decrease the free concentration of free enzyme in the solution according to Markus Barth.And through this reaction rate equation we can get different reaction rate in the condition of different PET film and PET enzyme initial PET enzyme concentration.In our case, in order to predict the optimum condition of recombination cell decomposing PET, it was carried out the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis model.In this way, we put the Langmuir adsorption equation linked with the second step of hydrolysis reaction process, here, the equation above is the key to connect the two step, and the valve of the CPET\x95S will be used in the next part.Because the reaction time relative to the adsorption time is so long that the time to achieve the adsorption equilibrium can be negligible, while, after reaching the maximum adsorption quantity, new PET enzyme will be adsorbed on the PET sheet soon whenever there is some PET enzyme reaction with PET to release the products.It\x92s obvious that K, k3, Ka are constant in the system, while, in a fixed experiment, the area of the PET sheet and the concentration of the PET enzyme are unchangeable according to hypothesizes above, so the right part of the equation above is a constant, B.There are three main steps in the whole process on the basis of the given assumptions above, the first step is the former part which describes the adsorption process and the second step is the effective combination for enzyme catalytic reaction of the PET film and the PET enzyme on the basis of the physical adsorption.So the valve of the character, B, is not a constant because the valve of the concentration of PET enzyme, Ef, is changeable with the reaction time.D.The adsorption process of PET enzyme on the PET-solid-surface will come a dynamic equilibrium after a certain time.It\x92s known that the general enzymatic reaction rate is far faster than diffusion rate, so, in this process, the hydrolysis reaction is very important as well as the diffusion adsorption process.As we all know, the symbol C means the concentration of the material, so we can get that CPET\x95S is the concentration of the adsorption combination state of the PET film and the PET enzyme; CPETS is the concentration of the effective combined of the PET film and the PET enzyme; CS is the concentration of the free PET enzyme in the solution and CDTP is the concentration of the product, dimethyl terephthalate.So we can get:The parameter valves can be given according to the literature and experimental data:So the image of the reaction rate with the time under the condition of the A=28.27mm2, and E0=4×10-3 is shown in the picture 3.Picture 3: The image of the reaction rate with the time.From the picture above, we can get that the reaction rate will decrease with the time because of the reaction products\x92 prohibition.Here, we use the character PET\x95S represent the middle state of PET enzyme adsorption on the surface of PET sheet.It avoid the solving process of the ?max needing the adsorption experiment by quartz crystal microbalance which would cost a lot of time.The model of PET enzymatic hydrolysis process is made up of two parts.E. The enzymatic reaction is carried out only on the solid surface of the PET sheet, and the PET enzyme won\x92t enter the interior of the PET, and the solubility of the PET in the solution is zero.According to Markus Barth, we can know that the products such as: TPA, MHET, EG and BHET have a competence of combining with the PET enzyme, what\x92s more, MHET and BHET are powerful in this.According to the Langmuir theory, the adsorption isotherm equation is:In the above equation, ? is the quality of PET enzyme adsorption by unit quality PET, g; ?max is the maximum adsorption of PET enzyme by unit quality PET, g; Ka is the adsorption dissociation constant, mL/g; Ef is the concentration of free PET enzyme in the solution, g/mL.In general, we use the double reciprocal method to find the adsorption constant of the Langmuir equation.Figure1 is a surf picture of our model, while Figure2 is a slice picture for our convenience in observing the details.Figure4: 4-D surf picture of Relative Enzyme ActivityFigure 5: 4-D slice picture of Relative Enzyme ActivityWe established the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis model established based on experimental data and find the mathematical expression of the efficiency of recombination cell decomposing PET.But the reaction rate shouldn\x92t be a constant according to our experimental results in the whole process which indicates that the reaction products has a certain effect on the process.While it\x92s no time for us to do so many adsorption process experiments, so it\x92s the other way we need to seek in order to solve the reaction kinetics problem well.While the combination of the PET enzyme and the products reduces the PET enzyme concentration in solution which moves the adsorption equilibrium to deduce the maximum adsorption capacity and equilibrium adsorption capacity.This isothermal adsorption equation is suitable for the case where there is only one adsorbed species, while the PET adsorption process is just this one.So the concentration of this PET\x95S can be achieved through the following equation:While in the above equation, K is a constant connecting the three characters and A represents the area of the PET film.And as we always know, the maximum adsorption capacity is certainly proportional to the area of the PET film, so the concentration of the combination state of the PET enzyme and PET film in the whole system is related to the PET film area and dimensionless adsorption capacity.D. The time to achieve the equilibrium of the adsorption reaction can be ignored.In this model, only the PET enzyme binds to the PET sheet and the PET is insoluble in the solution.DTP: The main product of PET hydrolysis, dimethyl terephthalate.According to combining the Langmuir equation and the reaction rate equation we get a heterogeneous kinetic model.The illustration is shown below by picture-2:Picture 2:a.The state of the adsorption without hydrolysis reaction happened.So the valve of the constant ?max and Ka is not wanted if we can get the reaction kinetics equation finally through another way.We set three variables as the reaction conditions in our model, which are the time(x1) and temperature(x2) of protein-induced expression and the cell concentration(x3).k1-6: The reaction constant of each reaction equation.So the kinetic equation eventually needs to be corrected which we will cover in the next section.In this part, our goal is to deduce the chemical reaction rate.So the Langmuir adsorption equation can be converted into the next form:The maximum adsorption capacity of the solution will be avoided by using this model.C.No intermolecular forces between the PET enzyme molecules.Here we only consider the main obstacles, BHET and MHET, even though we ignore these by-products because they are so few, but their influence on the adsorption can\x92t be excluded.We can get that when it\x92s 18 hours later, the reaction rate is zero which is in accordance with the experimental results that when we extend the reaction time the products won\x92t increase.Effect of hydrolysis products on the enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate nanoparticles by a polyester hydrolase from Thermobifida fusca.The change of the area of the PET sheet is assumed to be negligible due to the slow rate of PET decomposition.Turbidimetric analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate nanoparticles.PETS: The binding state of PET in the PET enzyme active site.We made a 4-dimension picture to show the relationship between the selected three conditions and the PET decomposition efficiency using our fitting model.The experimental data of one experiment group we used is shown in table2.Table 2: Relative Enzyme Activity of E-coli with INP(ice nucleation protein)The results of our model are as follows.The reverse reaction rate is assumed to be zero as the quality of cis-reaction products is negligible compared to the amount of solution due to the slow cis-reaction rate.We consider that the reaction efficiency correlates with the protein-induced expression time logarithmically, and correlates with the temperature of protein-induced reaction and cell concentration quadratically.', 'notebook': 'Cultivation of PETase in

Comprehensive Evaluation of Antibiotics Emission and Fate in the River Basins of China: Source Analysis, Multimedia Modeling, and Linkage to Bacterial Resistance.[2] Zhang, Q.-Q., Ying, G.-G., Pan, C.-G., Liu, Y.-S. & Zhao, J.-L. Comprehensive Evaluation of Antibiotics Emission and Fate in the River Basins of China: Source Analysis, Multimedia Modeling, and Linkage to Bacterial Resistance.Among all kinds of antibiotics, tetracycline is one of the most produced and used.One of the most serious damage tetracycline antibiotics have exerted on human beings is the tetracycline pigmentation teeth, which is rather prevalent in China.During the course of paper research, we found tetracycline antibiotics is one type of the most abundant antibiotics found in urban rivers, as illustrated in the table below [5].Occurrence and behavior of antibiotics in water and sediments from the Huangpu River, Shanghai, China.Our team is determined to work on the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics in our surroundings.The concentrations of the target antibiotics in (a) water samples and (b) sediment samples from the Huangpu River, Shanghai, China in July 2012 [5].Stunned by the large amount of antibiotic residues in Chinese urban rivers [4], UCAS iGEM team is devoted to degrading antibiotic residues in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) or hospitals.And that is why it is one of the most resistant antibiotics.Nowadays, tetracycline antibiotic residues mostly come from the overuse in animal husbandry and aquaculture industry.Tetracycline antibiotics are protein synthesis and cell growth inhibitors, inhibiting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex.However, the relatively low price of antibiotics has also led to its misuse, especially in developing countries like China.However, the mass production and misuse of antibiotics make them detectable in many places besides hospitals.In order to tackle the resistant bacteria, more antibiotic drugs should be taken so the resistant gene will be even stronger.Our survey indicates that people have misunderstandings on the correct use of antibiotics.Those tetracycline antibiotics not absorbed by animals will end up in soil and water, and eventually taken in by humans.Out-of-date antibiotic drugs are disposed randomly which is adding to the antibiotic residue pollution.[6] Tetracycline antibiotics can inhibit the development of children s teeth and bone growth, and are also easy to cause allergic reactions.High concentration of antibiotic residues in environment also encourages antibiotic resistance, since AR exposure is a form of \x93underdose\x94 as Fleming has mentioned.Chemosphere, 95, 604\x96612 (2014)  [6] Tetracycline antibiotics - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics"Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant"\xa0[1].Some cases of tetracycline pigmentation teeth have been speculated to have correlation with high concentration of tetracycline residues in drinking water.In China, about 147,000 tonnes of antibiotics are produced annually.However, the degrading super hero in the wrong place will be superbugs.Since penicillin was invented in 1928, antibiotics have been massively produced and have saved millions of people.', 'design': 'In our project, the engineered bacteria carry TetX, a natural antibiotic resistant gene.Mutagenic drift is particularly important for toxic proteins- or essential genes-based \x91kill switches\x92, for the selective pressure imposed on bacteria may lead to a dramatic alteration in the gene frequency.In the beginning, we put tetX gene directly under the control of pTet, a tetracycline-inducible promoter, so that the expression level of tetX will rise as the concentration of Tc goes up.Among them, Type II TA modules are the most extensively studied, so we decided to choose some of them to build and test our \x91kill-switch\x92.The gene coding T7 RNAP is placed downstream of pTet so that when the concentration of tetracycline increases, the amount of T7 RNAP will also increase to produce more tetX.Actually our goal is to apply our engineered bacteria to the degradation of as many as possible kinds of antibiotics which was theoretically feasible with different degradation enzyme and our system (details are shown below in \x93Extension\x94).Currently there are mainly three strategies to design a \x91kill-switch\x92: (1) Suicide system, where toxins or essential genes are commonly used to mediate cell death ;(2) Codon reassignment methods change the corresponding amino acid of a certain codon , like stop codon, and sometimes unnatural amino acids are assigned to that \x91new\x92 codon ; (3) Auxotroph is also commonly used.For this reason, the E.coli bearing the original circuit is called \x91Scavenger\x92, and the E.coli bearing the circuit with T7 RNAP is called \x91Captain Scavenger\x92.Genetically modified bacteria mainly pose threats to the environment through two ways: horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and bacteria escape.molecular oxygen (O2) is incorporated into verruculogen without O\x96O bond scission, which lead to the oxidative transformations of substrate this Mononuclear non-haem iron enzymes catalyse a wide range of reactions Tet X:TetX monooxygenase catalyzes regioselective hydroxylation at carbon 11a of tetracyclines.It ought to be neutralized by its corresponding protein when, like in the waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), it is not expected to suppress the growth of bacteria.Structural basis for a new tetracycline resistance mechanism relying on the TetX monooxygenase.After literature survey, we eventually chose four kinds of oxidase which can be expressed in E.coli and hopefully have opportunities to degrade tetracycline: MnCcP, CPO?FtmOx1, tet X. CPO: catalytic oxidative degradation of sulfamethoxazole by CPO-H2O2 in the presence of chloridion.To further improve the performance of the scavenger, T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) and T7 promoter are introduced to raise the expression level of tetX.Whilst natural existing antibiotic resistant enzymes serve as a pool for finding the right ones, other enzymes with similar mechanisms also have the potential to degrade antibiotics at a high rate.The concentration of Tet remains high in the biochemical pools before water leaves it, so bacteria can grow normally in the pool.Secondly, the toxin must be toxic enough to kill the bacteria with a relatively low dose.To check the state of the scavengers, a fusion protein tetX-GFP (BBa_K2150013) combining tetX (BBa_K2150101) with GFP (BBa_E0040) is constructed to replace the role of tetX.To be more specific, auxotrophic genetically modified microorganisms (GMOs) rely on a kind of substance added into the working environment.These bacteria depend on an artificial molecule added to the working environment to survive.Nonetheless, if the artificial bacteria escape from the work environment, the concentration of Tet in surroundings drops dramatically.In order to transform an ordinary E.coli into a terrific scavenger who can eliminate tetracycline(Tc), tetX gene has to be imported to E.coli, enabling it to degrade Tc.This figure also illustrates our \x91kill-switch\x92 design, see below.This figure also illustrates our \x91kill-switch\x92 design, see below.After a series of primary lab experiments such as transformation, protein expression, purification of protein, enzyme assay and so on, we intended to accomplish the screening tests of all kinds of enzymes we have selected, as well as enzyme activity tests and kinetics tests for enzymes with high tetracycline degradation efficiency.Enzyme with the best degradation performance would stand out through our screening and would be applied to the construction of engineered bacteria, whose degradation effect in vivo would be tested in further experiments.As antitoxin degrades faster than toxin in the cell, it soon disassociates from toxin, leading to accumulation of free toxins within bacteria cell, which eventually result in cell death or arrest of growth.No matter what method is taken to build the \x91kill-switch\x92, a good one should meet some criteria, namely, to prevent mutagenic drift , environment supplement and HGT.Tigecycline Is Modified by the Flavin-Dependent Monooxygenase TetX.In the presence of T7 RNAP, T7 promoter is recognized and activated, leading to increased transcription of downstream gene.In solutions of pH greater than 1, the product 11a-hydroxytetracycline can decomposes rapidly and non-enzymatically into products that are not easily identifiable oxidative reaction of tetracycline catalyzed by TetX The monooxygenase reaction mechanism relies on the redox properties of FAD.However, this does not mean that the toxin is not controllable.While staying in the biochemical pool at WWTPs, antitoxin is induced by high concentration of Tet.TA modules are composed of a toxin molecule and an antitoxin molecule, and can be categorized into five types .We expected the circuit with T7 RNAP to perform better than the one without.In contrast, the expression of toxin will not be impaired in either condition.This fact is fundamental to our \x91kill-switch\x92 design.Due to this high activity of T7 promoter, tetX protein can be produced in large quantity when tetX gene is expressed from T7 promoter.Without sufficient amount of Tet, the transcription of antitoxin is blocked by tetR.For those \x91kill-switches\x92 which make use of auxotrophies, environment supplement is a major challenge.CPO is considered to be the most versatile heme-containing enzyme, exhibiting peroxidase, catalase and cytochrome P450-like activities MnCcP : Crude MnP produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was used to degrade tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) in the presence of Mn2+ and H2O2 .MnCcP is a designed CcP with a Mn(II)-binding site by making Gly41Glu, Val45Glu, and His181Asp mutations, which can be expressed in procaryotic organisms.However, the real situation is much more complex than that.Since many of the oxidases require coenzymes or cofactors to function, they may have problems expressing in prokaryotic cells or for in vitro characterization.In this condition, TetX is also expressed and it oxidases Tet in vivo.Biochemistry.44, 11829-11835 (2005) [10] Gesa Volkers, Gottfried J. Palm, Manfred S. Weiss, Gerard D. Wright, Winfried Hinrichs.In our experiment design, we just took tetracycline degradation as an proof-of-concept.We designed a \x91kill-switch\x92 based on TA module.After reduction to FADH2 by NADPH, the isoalloxazine binds molecular oxygen to form a hydroperoxide.First of all, toxins and antitoxins should be readily expressed in E. coli, which is a basic requirement for genetic engineering in all circumstances.For example, a number of resistant proteins degrade antibiotics by oxidizing them, so other oxidases with similar or same coenzymes are highly likely to degrade antibiotics in similar ways.In order to build a good \x91kill-switch\x92, there are some major aspects we should consider.(2015) 539-543 [9] Ian F. Moore, Donald W. Hughes, and Gerard D. Wright.', 'human_practice': 'Although it is really difficult for a project in laboratory to meet criteria for commercialization, we were really inspired how synthetic biology can make people live better in the future.(d) Most people think it is OK to use artificial bacteria in WWTPs or hospitals to degrade AR as long as there is certain mechanism is deployed to make the system safe, which is exactly why we designed a double-function safe lock to prevent HGT and leakage at the same time.After the speech, we also talked with some investors from different countries, and learned that how government policy and support can influence their decisions, which is actually what synthetic biology lacks.That is also why we designed a double-function safe lock, preventing horizontal-gene-transfer and bacteria escape at the same time (see our Design part).During the poster session, we introduced to interested attendees the disasters antibiotic abuse may cause and tried to arise their awareness of careful usage of antibiotics (Fig.In our survey, we found that nearly 60% of all participants know the terminology and the mechanism underlies.In the morning on 4th SEP, we gave a presentation on our own project: the Ultra-sensitive Controllable Antibiotics Scavenger (Fig.55% of them believe that antibiotic residues can be found in sediments, and this proportion is the lowest among those chose surface/underground water and farm lands.This figure presents part of the results of our internet-based survey on antibiotic residues (AR).A surprisingly small number of people know the fact that antibiotics are widely found in drinking water, as indicated in the graph.As a new team taking part in iGEM for the first time, we benefited a lot from it.Mr. Schroeder is a Penn Alumni and is the only patent attorney on the industrial advisory board of SynBERC (the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center), a major U.S. research program to make biology easier to engineer.We explained our design and other work in detail, as well as introducing tremendous damages caused by antibiotic residues and our special design to solve this problem with the technique of SynBio.On the first weekend in September, we attended Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC).This indicates that even professionals know little about the scale and harm of antibiotic residues.Particularly, Mr. Schroeder also talked about how the iGEM competition has contributed to the development of synthetic biology and its industrialization.Our team sincerely wish more and more people, especially technical talents, can join the battle against antibiotic abuse with us, creating a safer and healthier future for the human beings.In general, the public underestimate the harm of antibiotic residues in environments and industrial products.China, as the world\x92s biggest and the most fast-growing economy, is also catching up in scientific research.When questioned whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms(GMOs) in waste water treatment plants(WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory.We also designed several questions on antibiotic residues, which is directly linked to our project.Antibiotic abuse is one of the major causes for antibiotic resistance, and this has gained much awareness from the general public.In CCiC, we tried our best to make everyone realize the importance of dealing with antibiotic residues more or less.We designed a questionnaire and conducted an internet-based survey on antibiotic resistance, antibiotic residues and asked participants\x92 opinions (especially safety concerns) on our project.At last, we asked people about security problems in our project.After presentation, we received a lot of attention from teachers and some other teams, further answering their questions about our project.From Mr. Schroeder\x92s speech, we learned how synthetic biology could be applied to produce real products that are closely connected to environment protection, manufacture green material and so on.What is more, we also observed that biological majors did not outperform non-biological majors on antibiotic residues.People tend to believe that antibiotic residues widely exist in nature.(a) Most use antibiotics according doctor\x92s prescription, but abuse in hospital is also a prominent problem.Most of them (at least 67%) know that antibiotics can be detected in meats (poultries, fish and cattle), but only 30% said they know antibiotics occur in drinking water, with merely 24% chose honey.', 'modeling': 'Since the quantity of substrate is limited in our experiments and the parameters should have clear physical meaning for further analysis, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model[5] as follows?

L. Shuler, S. Leung, and C. C. Dick, Mathematical Model For The Growth Of A Single Bacterial Cell, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1979, 326(326):35\x9652.The maximums of growth rate is slightly affected by the toxin of aTc, but it will do not change the discussion above.[2] Bruce R. Levin, Frank M. Stewart & Lin Chao, Resource-Limited Growth, Competition, And Predation: A Model And Experimental Studies With Bacteria And Bacteriophage, The American Naturalist.For any given ${gamma _P}$ , equation (23) can be fitted by multiple linear regression.The accurate solution of equation set (5) is not necessary because the expression of toxin only affect the terminal concentration of tetracycline degradation.Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.In addition, the growth rate curve of toxin 136 shows that the performance of antitoxin is not as good as others, thus we only focus on toxin 134,1204 and 6429.Accordingly, we can assume that the growth rate of total number of plasmids is equal to that of cells: Firstly, we discuss the solution of equation set (9) when ? is constant.At a concentration of around $0.8\text{ }!!~!!\text{ }!!mu!!\text{ g}/\text{ml}$ to $1..5\text{ }!!~!!\text{ }!!mu!!\text{ g}/\text{ml}$, a rough boundary can be seen, which confirmed that a switch effect occurs.The fitted values for parameters are shown in the table 1.From table 3, we can conclude that the corresponding antitoxin of toxin 6249 is most efficient.Then we assign ${gamma _P}$ point by point with a step of 0.000001 and find the best ${gamma _P}$ that maximize the linear coefficient.Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied.In the tetracycline uptake process of E.coli, two systems are involved: the rapid concentration-driven system which occurs initially and is insensitive to metabolic inhibitors, and the slow energy-driven system whose rate is only one-tenth of the rapid system[19].In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy, and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods, to show the influence of toxin and toxin-antitoxin coupling.For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.Can there be a model that fulfill the same functions as the traditional models, but with less parameters and with the least experiments?From the analysis mentioned above, we can conclude that toxin 6249 is most toxic and stable, its antitoxin is most efficient in neutralization as well.The example above clearly demonstrates the fact that, ODE model is sensitive to the values of parameters.Bacteria growth and protein expression are the most fundamental issues in synthetic biology.Therefore v(t) can be solved: Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density.Therefore, we employ ingenious tactics to build a practicable model of antibiotics degradation protein expression, bacteria growth under toxin-antitoxin coupling, and the overall circuit by in-depth analysis with least experiments.As is shown in figure 11, B(c) is low but not zeros when the concentration of tetracycline is zeros, this phenomenon indicates that leakage of promoter happens.Though it is still unknown whether the concentration-driven system can be categorized as passive diffusion or facilitated transport, the transportation rate is in proportion to the gradient of tetracycline concentration.The term 1 and term 4 of equation (12) take the vast majority of the sum of absolute values.5 Test result of the hypothesis for each type of bacteria in different concentration of aTc.We respectively measured the bacteria growth under different concentration of anhydrotetracycline(aTc), which induce the expression of toxin.On the contrary, bacteria are not influenced by the toxin inducer when antitoxins are expressed earlier.In mathematical form, the numerical relation is: So, we can assume that the existing toxin molecules are either in binding with target molecules, or in the toxin-antitoxin complex.[21] Goryachev A B, Toh D J, Lee T. Systems analysis of a quorum sensing network: Design constraints imposed by the functional requirements, network topology and kinetic constants[J].From another perspective, we can see that toxin 134 is inactivated before the antitoxin is induced by IPTG, which is because the leakage of antitoxin promoter or the instability of toxin.Dots are experimental values, and red curve is the fitted results.To make things worse, the ordinary differential equations are sensitive to parameters, and the errors will be amplified with time.Part 2 deals with the expression of tetracycline resistance protein, we use piecewise linear method for simplification, eigen decomposition method to extract the dominant sector.During the delay, antitoxin are synthesized and form binding with toxin.As long as the toxin is neutralized by its antitoxin, bacteria return to the normal state and grow as if in free conditions.Models usually relay on searching the parameters from previous works, but the values are measured under different conditions by different methods so the errors cannot be simply ignored.As expected, the shape and maximum are the same within error limits, and a delay can be clearly seen.The antitoxin is produced to neutralize toxin and the excessive part is degraded.Later, B(c) increase rapidly and reach its peak at around 2.5 mg/L, at which concentration the promoter is activated to the most.The form of the model is too complex, but the result shows that the replication period is converged to be synchronized with cell cycle.Our model minimizes the necessary experiments to get all necessary parameters, which is conducive to the industrial appliance and also propagable to modeling of other projects.It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions.Then the differential of tetracycline concentration within the cell caused by diffusion can be calculated directly.5, it can be convinced that the experimental group is the same as the control group under low aTc concentrations at the confidence of 90%, and distinct from control group under high aTc concentrations.Firstly, we add aTc in gradient concentration and excessive IPTG(8mmol/L) at the same initial time and measure their growth, as is shown in Fig.3 shows the growth of bacteria with toxin 1204 plasmid.The green curve is the mean value, and red area is the range mean value added and subtracted by the standard error.The bindings of first two processes are the limiting and rate-defining step.All of these substances can be degraded, therefore each has a degradation rate.It cannot be ignored because the lifetime of protein is rather stable that mRNA and peptide chain.Modeling is the art of description, estimation, prediction and optimization with limited knowledge and experimental data, which is exactly what we have to face.The demonstration above shows how to select an appropriate TA block with the mathematical model.[1] Liu, Y. Overview of some theoretical approaches for derivation of the Monod equation, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology.It can be expected that equilibrium sector and the degradation sector will still be the dominant ones when parameters are time-dependent.$G=Papp\times frac{A_{0}}{V_{0}}=0.67 s^{-1}$.We add a normal-distributed random relative error with a maximum of 5% to each of the 9 parameters in their model, which is far within the significant digit of these parameters.Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.Figure 9 is the calculation result, and the red area is the 70% confidence interval.The result shows that a much longer time is needed for bacteria to overcome the effect of toxin, if antitoxin is induced later than toxin.Since the bacteria in our experiments are of same species and are prepared by a same procedure, we regard the initial value of v as a constant in all these experiments.Therefore, a model with as many as 9 parameters collected from different sources are not only unnecessary but also unreliable.The reason for the delay is that, the way across the cytomembrane is different for aTc and IPTG.We fit the data with methods that mentioned previously, toquantify how parameters in growth function change with toxin.White blocks represent that the hypothesis cannot be rejected at the confidence of 90%, and colored blocks represent rejection at the same confidence.It takes the longest time for bacteria cells to overcome the effect of toxin 6249 after antitoxin is induced, therefore toxin 6249 is most toxic and also stable.In part 3 we integrate the two parts into a complete model, with which we do simulations to reach our conclusions.We study the effects of toxin alone on cell growth in our experiments.Bacteria with genes of aTc induced toxin 134, 136, 1204, 6249 and their corresponding IPTG induced antitoxin are prepared.OD600 (red)

degradation and procedural suicide genes obtained via screening, and many parameters are not available or not easy to search.Toxins may cause growth inhibition or death by targeting at DNA replication, mRNA stability, protein synthesis, cell-wall biosynthesis, and ATP synthesis [9].Thus, we only retain term 1 and term 4 in our equation.The latter is not as important as the former, hence we only consider the concentration-driven factors.8.Growth rate of bacteria with TA system induced by aTc and excessive IPTG at different time.To exemplify how error can be amplified, we would like to use model and parameter values from previous iGEM competitions.', 'notebook': 'We found the E.coli bearing this plasmid is green when excited \x91tetX-GFP\x92 was assembled on pSB1C3, and was sent to

degrading abilities of four enzymes, and found out the most efficient one, the TetX.As a collaboration, we measured the growth curve of E. coli harboring toxin MazF by 96-well microplate spectrophotometer for the iGEM team from Beijing Institute of Technology.During the summer, we worked hard to build our system, which consists of mainly three parts, and we got some quite promising results.We demonstrated that out of the four antitoxins cloned, three effectively neutralized their corresponding toxins.We cloned several potential antibiotic degrading enzymes, including TetX monoxygenase (TetX) and MnCcP, and successfully expressed and purified them.As a proof-of-concept, we showed that TetX can degrade Tet in vivo.We met with iGEMers from several universities including Peking University, Tianjin University, Beijing Institute of Technology, and Xiamen University, during which we discussed each other\x92s projects and problems occurred in experiments.Besides collecting information from the public, we also get to the next generation.In previous years, dozens of teams have worked on tackling antibiotic resistant bacteria, while a small number of teams paid attention to degrading antibiotics, and few team showed solid data on how much antibiotic can be degraded in their projects.To measure the degrading rate, samples were taken for 30 minutes\x92 interval, and the amount of remaining Tet were measured by LC-MS or UV absorption.We also attended this year\x92s CCiC held during 2nd-4th Sept. at Sun Yet-Sen University in Guangzhou, where we lectured on our projects and took part in the poster session.They are also working on toxins to build a kill-switch, so our measurement can be quite important for them.We demonstrated that Mn(III) can also degrade Tet, providing a basic idea for future work.We successfully cloned 11 putative toxins onto a cloning vector, induced by aTc (anhydrotetracycline).Working with our Advisor Cheng Hu, we successfully established a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using SupelTM \x96Select SPE (Sigma-Aldrich).We measured the growth curve of bacteria expressing the toxins.We established a method of

degradation enzyme genes (antibiotic resistant genes), we install a filter membrane at the exit of water channels in our hardware to inhibit the escape of our bacteria, and the bacteria in activated sludge can also be pumped back bio-pool.As long as antibiotics decrease to a low concentration, antitoxin expression will become less than toxin which leads to the death of our bacteria so that it won\x92t be an antibiotic resistant superbug after accomplishing its mission.In our system, the degradation enzyme can only be expressed under high concentration of tetracycline antibiotics.In our questionnaire, we asked people about security problems in our project, for instance, whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory.That is also why we use a biocontainment strategy and prevent bacteria escape at the same time.So these degradation enzymes won\x92t exert negative impact outside laboratory, and won\x92t harm any plants, animals or human beings.We choose a non-pathogenic chassis, E.coli, and pay high attention to our project design, lab work, shipment, etc.Most of the culture medium containing antibiotics should be inactivated by high temperature of autoclaved

'The concept of our project was to first delete B. subtilis\x92s BB, and replace its SBP and ABC transporter by the ones of P. larvae.We finally chose bee excrements where P. larvae is still present, which will not be a big concern regarding public opinion and finally which is not invasive.We based our detection system on the iron uptake system of P. larvae and we chose Bacillus subtilis to detect it since they both have a similar iron regulation system.For instance, during low iron concentrations conditions in the extracellular environment, P. larvae and B. subtilis produce iron chelating agents, known as siderophores, and in our case it is the bacillibactin (BB).BB is a catechol-based siderophore-secreted by members of the genus Bacillus (antracis, subtilis).The amount of intracellular iron in B. subtilis will increase with the use of P. larvae\x92s BB, which will activates FUR and therefore repress LacI.This chain of events will lead to the expression of our pigment, silent in normal conditions, indicating the presence of P. larvae.In a lab settings, the ideal would be to test our modified bacteria simply with P. larvae\x92s BB instead of working with the pathogen itself.On one hand, the idea being that by putting our modified B. subtilis in the same environment, B. subtilis will be forced to use the P. larvae siderophore which is possible now with the help of the ABC transporter and SBP specific to P. larvae.For the sake of a proof of concept, we modified our system where we will instead remove all other iron uptake system, and its own BB from B. subtilis.If our bacteria changes color, it would indicate that they were able to take up the BB from the unmodified B. subtilis, and also that our pigment expression system is functional.Other factors than pathogens can indicate beehives health.We went from the basic idea of P. larvae detection system with a promotor repressed by a transcription factor in normal condition.Those factors include the bee pathogen Paenibacillus larvae, heavy metals levels, and sugar levels, which will all be detected in bees  excrements.We chose to use bees\x92 excrements for testing as it is the less invasive solution we found.The other being that the pigment may not be as visible as we would expect in the living organism plus larvae\x92s cells are closed at some point and even if they do change color we won\x92t be able to observe it.On the other hand, we want to put a pigment under a LacI promotor (for example), itself being regulated by FUR.With the presence of the component to detect, that transcription factor will no longer block the expression of the pigment, thus the staining of B. subtilis.It is involved in the chelation of ferric iron (Fe3+) from the surrounding environment and is subsequently transferred into the bacterial cytoplasm via the use of ABC transporters and siderophore binding proteins (SBP).In the presence of Fe, FUR, a negative transcription factor, dimerizes upon iron II binding and inhibits its target genes expression.In this case the color change could be observable in the living bees but we encountered two issues.Once in the intracellular environment, first the Fe3+ is converted into Fe2+ then the FUR (Ferric Iron Regulator) takes over.Our idea is to create a system that could be adapted to study any type of factors we are interested in by simply using the same system but each time modifying promotors to make it specific to the factor of interest.', 'human_practice': 'Our "Bee subtilis" put in a free iron media, would only be able activate the production of blue pigment when the defecation contains P. larvae.Finally as we send survey to beekeepers to ask them about our project (here) and after what Mr. Lecompte told us (here).Futhermore, he explained to us that our system wouldn t give any useful informations as one bee, carying our "Bee subtilis", wouldn t be representative of the entire hive health.The project evolved into something more beekeepers friendly and closer to reality, as we decided to use our modified bacteria as an external bio sensor.Inside of the bees guts, our "Bee subtilis" would be able to grow only in the presence of P. larvae (as the bees  guts are poor in free Fe2+ iron,"Bee subtilis" needs the siderophore of P. larvae to grow).We put the target sequence of FUR next to a LacI sequence that we introduced into our "Bee subtilis", the lacI would inhibate the expression of a pigment, which mean that in the presence of P. larvae, "Bee subtilis" is going to produce a pigment, easily observable by beekeepers, that would color bees.At this point, everything was pretty set.The idea was to insert the receptors specific to the siderophore of P. larvae into our B. subtilis (after deleting its own siderophore receptors).We decided that the best, to help beekeepers have better knowledge of the health statuts of their hives, would be to mesure several factors (as the CCD is multi-factorials).-sugars (Fructose and Sucrose) as the contamination by virus or Nosema ceranae, conduct to sweet defecations by bees.-P. Larvae as one of the main factors of CCD in the US.-Heavy metals as some of the beekeepers were interested by Heavy metal detections, and that some of bees poisoning might be by unknown source or not well studied.However after our first encounter with Mr. Philippe Lecompte, president of the bees biodiversity network, we decided to oriented our project to the detection of pathogens.we try to resume here all the modification we brought to our project after each critical encounter we madeOriginally our project was about to create a system able to detect pesticides in the guts of Apis mellifera, and protect them from any harms, in E. coli.As bacteria aren t able to produce their own iron, they have to get it from their surrounding environnement) of the bacteria with a modified B. subtilis.We choose B. subtilis as it is a Gramm + bacteria very similar to P. larvae.We decided to focus on one of the worst pathogens currently in action in the US, P. larvae.This one would also help researchers collecting data.In conclusion we tried to create, during the IGEM competition, a beekeepers friendly system, that would allow them to follow severals factors involved in bees  health, outisde the hives, easily usable by beekeepers.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': 'Verification of TE we have is needed!Got rid of water and tried to let it dry but without success so will probably just add directly EtOH in to make more CmNote: agar cooled too much before pouring plate (only got 3 plates) so made more 100 mL melted LB agar + 20 uL cmMade SpII-EGTA solution (solutions made yesterday by SofianeAfter thawing competent BSU9716 at 37C in incubator (water bath had issues), added 500 uL of SpII-EGTA and mixed up and down.Added 50 uL bacteria in 5 eppendorf tubes after spinning CT plasmids, added 1 uL of DNA in the appropriate tube (50pg/ul, 20pg/ul, 10pg/ul, 5pg/ul, 0.5pg/ul).Bacteria+DNA mixture incubated at 37°C with shaking (150 rpm) for an hourSpreaded the bacteria on Cm LB agar plate then put at 37°C overnightAt this point from the rest of competent bacteria, 100 uL spread on Kan platesShould have spread the transformed bacteria on Cm and Kan platesCompetency test kit contains five vials of purified DNA from BBa_J04450 (RFP construct) in plasmid backbone pSB1C3 (cm resistant).? 2 boites de LBamp à 100 µg/mL avec du e.coli DH5 alpha + pBS1C  ? 1 boite de LB sans Amp avec que du e.coli DH5 alpha Transformation from 26/08 worked: Red on transformed and nothing red on negative control Made 2 bottles of 1X TAE (100 mL TAE 10X and 900 mL water osmosee) Set up PCR programs for deleted fragments amplification61.6 degrees middle and +2 gradient 3 on left and 3 on right tube 4 in whole 7Dilution Primers: final concentration 5 uM (2.5 uL primer+47.5 uL nuclease free water) Dilution pEN: 1/10 (2 uL pEN + 18 uL Elution Buffer EB) final concentration 3.32 ug/mL1.2% Gel of Gent amplification PCR product (Djamila) 1.2 g Agarose 100 mL TAE 1X 10 uL (10000 X) Gel redGent resistance gene size: 534 bp Band looks like it\x92s around the expected sizeNote: Have same amount of DNA in all well and this was supposed to be a gradient PCR.50 ml LB and 10 uL Kan added (so total 150 mL and 15 uL Kan) and cells back in incubatorSpin (4000 rpm 10 min) 50 ml X 2 and used pellet for competencySpinned again same way after pulling both pellet togetherChanged medium (50 mL LB + 5 uL Kan) and put it back at 4 degrees2 mL of SpC BSU in SpII and 90 min incubation 37 degrees with shakingOriginally 1.2% of the dihydrate form so made the calculations in function of that; and Sofiane had to make a second batchContains lawn and colonies ?

for his advice and guidance in setting up the team and for his efforts in helping establish a Melbourne University iGEM community.We would like to thank Peter for his advice during the formation of the team.The 2016 Melbourne iGEM Team was founded as an extracurricular group in a disused biochemistry laboratory across from the biochemistry staff offices.Additionally he often helped troubleshoot when we ran into difficulties and provided sage advice when it was needed.A/Prof Paul Gooley helped oversee the planning and design of the StarScaffold project.Without them we would not have been able to maintain regular laboratory hours and critical project momentum.The biochemistry teaching lab technical staff were always there to help us when we (often) needed them.Verkade, Mitchell, and Mulhern helped supervise our lab work.After much deliberation we decided on the StarScaffold and we began to flesh it out.', 'background': '', 'description': 'As a result of this function they\x92ve been developed extensively for many protein splicing and immobilisation applications[8][9].We have used this property on the arms of our star-like peptide, allowing them to be seamlessly ligated to desired molecules such as enzymes.The arms are able to be ligated to various other molecules such as enzymes, therapeutic molecules, or even each other, and star-like peptides ligated to molecules in such a manner have demonstrated potential applications in areas such as drug delivery, improvement of enzyme kinetics, and novel material design[2][3].The 2014 Melbourne iGEM team designed a novel 4-armed star-like peptide which was intended to be produced and formed largely in vivo using the bacteria E. coli and designed the peptide to contain Magainin 1 antimicrobial peptides on each of the four arms.The overall synthesis mechanism is very similar to the original 2014 peptide, however, the addition of Leucine Zipper domains as well as amino acid sequence optimisation alleviates a key issue of the original peptide, which was the improbability of hairpin loop and disulphide formation[4][5].Our project, StarScaffold, features a new design with several improvements over the 2014 model, most significantly the incorporation of Split Intein motifs on the ends of each arm, as well as amino acid sequence optimisations and inclusion of new protein domains.The addition of Split Inteins importantly allows the formation of highly stable bonds in a specific and controlled manner, giving our molecule significantly improved utility.The StarScaffold is transcribed as a single linear peptide, with Split Inteins in the formation shown.Disulphide bond formation and protease cleavage will then be conducted in vitro under their respective reaction conditions.Inteins are a collection of natural protein splicing domains discovered in the late 20th century, which are able to undergo a self catalysed four step reaction that results in the removal of the intein domains from the host protein and the formation of a native peptide bond between their flanking sequences.The two structures of immediate interest to our team are proteinaceous, permanent hydrogels and enzyme scaffold molecules.The ability of StarScaffold molecules to ligate to each other via split intein interaction potentially allows them to form polymeric protein networks, and we intend to use this property to create a hydrogel composed of repeating subunits of StarScaffold molecules.The use of inteins also allows the star-like peptides to ligate to each other, potentially forming polymeric structures.The StarScaffold is a foundational method of rapid, specific covalent binding and immobilisation of proteins in a fixed or unfixed orientation.In similar but simpler systems rate increases of 77 fold have been seen[12], suggesting the StarScaffold s utility, especially for more complex chemical pathways that might be incompatible with other methods of co-localisation.1.Sulistio, A., Gurr, P. A., Blencowe, A., & Qiao, G. G. (2012).The protein splicing motifs added to each end of the StarScaffold have been chosen for their ability to rapidly and selectively ligate proteins in a high strength fashion.We have created multiple prototypes with varying usage of Leucine Zipper domains to determine optimal formation conditions.The formation of disulphide bonds in E. coli usually takes place within the oxidising environment of the periplasm[6] However, mutant E. coli strains exist which are capable of facilitating disulphide bond formation in the cytoplasm, circumventing this issue[7].Although the peptide was synthesised and extracted, results were ultimately inconclusive.The 2016 iGEM team recognises the enormous potential and applications of star-like peptides, and as a result we decided to continue the work of the 2014 team.The modular nature of our system would allow the physical and biochemical properties of our hydrogel to be easily adjusted by changing star arm length or amino acid composition, or adding specialised ligands, allowing it to avoid many of the aforementioned issues, as well as potentially integrating desirable traits such as biointegration, bioerosion, cargo stabilisation, substrate selectivity, tissue adhesion and intelligent reactivity.TEV protease will then cleave the protein in the middle of the loop, forming the mature star-like peptide.Our project, StarScaffold, deals with star-like peptides, a recently invented class of synthetic proteins [1].Many different Inteins exist, and most Split Inteins from different Inteins do not cross-react[10], allowing us to control which specific arm a given molecule will bind to.Through random movement, the peptide is expected to fold over itself into a hairpin loop.However, given the time constraints for our project, we are currently following a more simplified synthesis pathway where the peptide is expressed in standard E. coli vectors before being extracted in its immature, linear form.Chinese Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 29(8): 734-739.11.Dueber, J.

spread the word of synthetic biology and iGEM to high school and university students, and the general public.We wanted to share our love of synthetic biology with the other science students, and tell them about iGEM and inspire them to join in the future.We wanted to inspire and educate people and encourage the current and future students to be a part of iGEM and secure Melbourne University s  future in the competition.We felt that it was important to target students in their final years of high school.We hoped that hearing about synthetic biology, and exciting extra curricular activities such as iGEM from current students would inspire them to consider a university education particularly in science.The presentations talked about the University experience, iGEM, synthetic biology, and some examples where synthetic biology has been successfully implemented to improve energy production, or health and medicine.It seemed that even at a University, many people were unfamiliar with synthetic biology, even members of our iGEM team admittedly hadn t heard about it prior to getting involved in iGEM.The 2016 team is very passionate about making sure that the University will continue to have an iGEM team in the years to come, and we felt that class presentations was a good way to spread the word.We did talks in the 2nd and 3rd year undergraduate Biochemistry classes, telling them about our project and the many other exciting projects that have been achieved as part of iGEM in the past.Our vision is that the blog will be maintained by future Melbourne University iGEM teams and be a place where teams can interact with the community (followers) and post surveys, videos, and general updates on their progress.The crowd-funding page featured a video describing our project and its applications and raised more than USD$2,000.We also set up a citizen sciences blog on Wordpress (melbourneigem.wordpress.com) to share synthetic biology, biotechnology, and iGEM related news.We wanted to inform the public about synthetic biology, and tell people about our project.', 'modeling': 'We can therefore define the time constant for Scenario B as:As we go from Scenario A to Scenario B, the reaction rate will increase by a factor of $frac{tau_A}{tau_B}$:frac{tau_A}{tau_B} &= frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-frac{1}{3}}}{v} \times frac{v}{1.633r}\\&= frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-frac{1}{3}}}{1.633r}\\We believe that a useful application for the star peptide is to increase the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway.This can be achieved with two star peptides joined together in conjunction with the enzymes attached to the ends of the arms as illustrated below.As part of our collaboration with NUS Singapore, we asked them to provide us with a diffusion simulator so that we could gain insight into the behaviour of molecules surrounding the star peptides.The raw MATLAB files provided can be downloaded here.The model was set up to mimic the two star peptides illustrated above.Assume:The concentrations of all enzymes and the star peptide are the same in both scenarios and are denoted by the constant $C$The substrates for the enzymes are floating around freely, and their concentration is a non-limiting factorFor a given enzyme concentration of $C$ molar, the mean square displacement (the average length between each enzyme) is:Therefore, define the time constant $\tau_A$ as the average time of an enzyme substrate to diffuse between two enzymes in Scenario A:$$\tau_A = frac{MSD}{v} = frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-frac{1}{3}}}{v}$$Here, $v$ represents the velocity via Brownian motion given by:Assume that the steric interactions between the peptide arms interact so that the average star peptide shape is tetrahedral.Therefore, assuming that all products from enzyme reactions continue flow towards the node where they are being consumed and don t interact with other star peptides, the length the substrates need to travel is $1.633r$.The mass action law multiplied by a factor of $frac{\tau_A}{\tau_B} = 7.23 \times 10^{-10}(frac{1}{rC^{frac{1}{3}}})$ was used in the mevalonate pathway that uses the star peptide.$N_{seg}$: The number of amino acids in a segment, where bonds between segments are random$r_i$: The length of arm i, defined as the Euclidean distance from the centre of the star peptide to the end of the final amino acid of arm $i$Self-avoiding means that once a point on the grid is occupied, it cannot be occupied again.The corresponding normal distribution curve is also plotted.The following is a visualisation of the star peptide s probabilistic diameter.In order to obtain a theoretical relationship between arm length and the number of amino acids on each arm, we shall attempt to analyse the energy of the system.Then, we will aim to compare the average diffusion time between star peptide arms with the average collision time of a normal solution and develop a relationship for the efficiency of the star peptide.This simulator will assist in gauging the behaviour of molecules surrounding the star peptides.In this section we aim to develop a probabilistic model of the length of each arm of the star peptide, based on the number of amino acids in each arm.Using this stochastic model, we can estimate the diffusion time constant between arms of the star peptide via Brownian motion.Our overall goal is to model the reaction kinetics of a solution where enzymes are connected to the star peptide and compare it to the kinetics of when the enzymes are floating freely in the solution.There are a number of assumptions involved that will affect the accuracy of this model:This refers to a random distribution of the bonds connecting amino acids.It is effectively excluding a portion of the total volume.A self-avoiding random walk simulation on a periodic lattice was constructed to visualise the structure of the star peptide.On this page we will be using a range of modelling techniques in order to attempt to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of the star peptide.Firstly, we shall aim to probabilistically determine the shape and structure of the star peptide.Now, assuming the springs obey Hookean dynamics, we will develop a relationship between force applied and extension.$$k_{eff} = frac{1}{frac{1}{2k} + frac{1}{2k}}$$$$E_{total} = frac{3k_B T}{2Na^2} r^2 + frac{k_b T a^3 N^2}{2r^3}$$$$frac{3k_B T}{Na^2} r - 3frac{k_b T a^3 N^2}{2r^4} = 0$$Substituting in values used in simulation ($N_{seg} = 100, a = 1$):$$r = 2^{frac{1}{5}}100^{frac{3}{5}} approx 13.8$$ This theoretical value is slightly larger than the simulated value.The aim of the model was to map the concentration fields of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA as they are produced and consumed at the arms of the star peptides.The following assumptions were used:the concentration of Acetyl-CoA is uniform and not a rate-limiting factorthe initial concentration fields of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA are equal and uniformthe diffusion constants of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA are equalthe rate of conversion of Acetoacetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA at the HMG-CoA Synthase node is dependent upon the concentration of Acetoacetyl-CoA at the nodethe rate of consumption of HMG-CoA at the HMG-CoA Reductase node is dependent upon the concentration of HMG-CoA at the nodeThe adapted NU Singapore MATLAB files for this model can be downloaded here.These concentration fields clearly demonstrate the production and consumption of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA at the relevant nodes.The mass action law was used to model the reaction kinetics of the normal cell.We shall now simulate the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway using the SimBiology toolbox in MATLAB.For the rest of the model, we shall use the empirical value.Obviously there will be complex interactions between the amino acids which will create a very unique protein structure.This is because over a range of amino acids, the bonds will eventually become uncorrelated.We will assume that each arm is the same and thus has the same spring constant.The simulation was run 10,000 times and the following probability distribution for the arm length $r$ was obtained.', 'notebook': 'Gel electrophoresis of the samples showed a much high percentage of successful colonies.Inoculated

StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised) with a gradient of annealing temperature between 50-60 °C.Most of the colonies did not have an insert.Some sequences of the pET23a with StarScaffold DNA (Prototype 1, Prototype 2, Non-Seq 1 and Double Helix) were verified.Ligation and transformation of Non-StarScaffold DNA into pSB were aborted as the protein expression with ligated pET23a plasmids had a high priority.Performed PCR with Q5 polymerase on StarScaffold DNA again.Digested the PCR-amplified StarScaffold DNA with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF and then gel purified.Digested pSB1C3 with EcoRI-HF and

the successful colonies (Prototype 1, Prototype 2, Non-Seq 1, Non-Seq 2 and No Helix in pSB1C3) in LB-CAP, miniprep and sequence with VF2 and VR primers.There were issues with staining and destaining procedures again.Performed PCR on the StarScaffold DNA in pSB1C3 with VF2 and VR primers and PCR purified before sending for sequencing.pET23a with StarScaffold DNA was transformed into BL21(DE3) again and plated on LB-AMP agar plate.Gel electrophoresis of the colony PCR indicated that there were some successful DH5? colonies (StarScaffold DNA in pSB1C3).The optimal annealing temperature were 53 °C and 51 °C respectively.Transformed the new ligated products (StarScaffold DNA in pET23a) into DH5a and plated on LB-AMP agar.Performed colony PCR of the transformed cells.Gel showed that the best annealing temperature was 51.6 °C but all samples at different annealing temperature had non-specific amplicons.Performed a touch down PCR in an attempt to reduce non-specific, but it did not succeed.Performed PCR with Q5 polymerase on all StarScaffold and non-StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised).Gel electrophoresis showed no band.Performed another PCR optimisation with the same condition with No Helix StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised) and with a plasmid as a positive control.It is found that the best annealing temperature for the BioBrick prefix and suffix primers was 40.0 °C when amplifying StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised).Performed PCR optimisation using the BioBrick prefix and suffix primers, Q5 polymerase and No Helix StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised) with a gradient of annealing temperature between 40-60 °C.Gel showed that most PCR samples did not have non-specific amplicons.All PCR-amplified samples were cleaned with PCR purification.All PCR-amplified-purified DNA (StarScaffold and non-StarScaffold) were digested with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF and cleaned with PCR purification.Digested pSB1C3 with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF and cleaned with PCR purification.Digested and PCR-purified StarScaffold DNA inserts were ligated into digested and PCR-purified pSB1C3 plasmid.Transformed the ligated products (StarScaffold DNA in pSB1C3) into DH5a and plated on LB-AMP agar.BLAST was performed and found that the insert could be from genomic contamination which happened to be of the right size.Ligation of StarScaffold DNA into pSB1C3 was aborted because ligation of StarScaffold DNA into pET23a and subsequently the protein expression have a higher priority.Thinking that genomic contamination could come from the midiprep of pET23a, more pET23a was digested with NotI and NdeI and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP).Performed colony PCR with VF2 and VR primers on the transformed colonies.This may prevent plasmid religation and reduced the change of having colonies without the insert, and also prevent digested genomic contamination from being ligated into the plasmid.Ligated the digested and SAP-treated pET23a with StarScarffold DNA.PCR optimisation using VF2 and VR primers, as well as T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers with known plasmids.Although there were issues with staining and destaining procedures, protein bands were observed with poor resolution.Digested pSB1C3 and StarScaffold DNA from Week 11 were ligated and transformed into DH5? cells.Cells worked very well with DNA >10 ng during transformation.Transformed DH5? with empty pSB1C3 and pET23a plasmids individually and plated them on LB-CAP and LB-AMP agar respectively.They were inoculated into LB-CAP media and then a miniprep was performed.Streak plated empty NEB Shuffle T7 cells on LB agar which will be used for making more competent cells.Inoculated Shuffle T7 cells in LB media, grew to OD 0.6 and chemically treated to make ultra-competent cells.New BL21(DE3)

registry.OverviewWe designed the sequence for our novel StarScaffold protein, and chose a set of split inteins which could be used together to join the Scaffolds together (or to link enzymes to the Scaffold)We successfully cloned our StarScaffold genes into E. coli using the pSB-1C3 and pET-23a vectors, and confirmed their size and sequences.Our designed StarScaffold genes were sent to iGEM headquarters as part of the Biobrick registry.We expressed our StarScaffold protein from BL21(DE3) E. coli, and confirmed the protein\x92s size via SDS-PAGE.Designing the StarScaffoldDrawing our inspiration from the Melbourne 2014 Team\x92s Star Peptide project, we aimed to utilise the properties of star-shaped proteins.These were then screened with colony PCR to check the size of our inserts, which were further confirmed via sequencing.Using colony PCR, we identified the pET-23a plasmids that had our inserts ligated in, as shown in the gel electrophoresis photos below.Colony PCR

identified on the gels above, one colony of each of the 4 variants was grown up and sequenced to confirm that the sequences were correct.In the first stages of our project, we worked on designing the sequences for our StarScaffold protein.We designed sequences for several variants of the StarScaffold, of which four were successfully cloned and sent to the Biobrick registry: our two main Prototype parts, an alternative Double Helix design with lengthened helix domain that may lend itself to better in vivo disulphide formation, and an alternate Non-Sequential design which can be used to test enzyme co-localisation with previously tested inteins.After re-sequencing two more DoubleHelix colonies (as the first one we sequenced carried a mutation), we confirmed that we had correct sequences for these 4 StarScaffold proteins in pET-23a vectors.Sequencing of pET on 160830 pg 116Proto1 (1), proto2 (27), nonseq1 (18), dbhelix (18)Results: all were fine except db helix, which had a mutation.Re-sequencing the other db helix pET colonies on 160905 pg 125Db helix (20) and (24)Results: correctExpressing the StarScaffold proteinsWe continued onwards to expression with the 4 StarScaffolds above that were cloned into pET and had the right sequence.[[T--Melbourne--2_intein_table.jpg]]Cloning the StarScaffold into E. coliOnce we had received the synthesised genes we ordered, the first stage in our project was to clone the genes into the plasmid vectors pSB-1C3 and pET-23a for storage and expression, respectively.Whole cell samples were taken both before and after the induction period, and run with SDS-PAGE sample buffer; the gel was then visualised using Coomassie staining.Expected Prototype 1 size: 37kDaNote: we see leaky expression from the T7 promoter.', 'safety': 'All of which are filed in the laboratory for any member of the team to check as necessary, and detail the need for PPE, a fume hood or other risk management tools.Within our laboratory we always follow some basic laboratory rules including; No running in the laboratory, no eating or drinking, hands must be washed prior to exiting the laboratory, long hair must be tied back and all incidents must be reported to our supervisor.If the E.coli that produces the Starscaffold was to be used outside of a laboratory it would also be necessary to further investigate the potential of the Starscaffold genes to act as a virulence factor and the risk of horizontal transfer of these genes between microbes.Moreover, every team member is inducted into the correct handling of each piece of laboratory equipment before use.To manage the risk to the environment that our genetically modified organisms pose, our laboratory follows the Australian Guidelines.These guidelines also detail the way we transport our bacteria between laboratories, work within our lab and forbid the release of any GMO organisms to the environment.One of the future applications we envision for our project is its use in drug development.To reduce this risk we have all undergone laboratory training and inductions before the use of any equipment.However there is still the risk of injury due to the laboratory equipment and reagents we use.We only work in our laboratory when there is one of our supervisors in the general vicinity, to help if there is an incident of any sort.This would involve further characterisation and in vitro experiments, animal trials and eventually human trials.We also envision the Starscaffold having a potential use in manufacturing and within household and agricultural products.All of these uses would require our Starscaffold being exposed to the patient s immune system.To achieve any of these goals we would need the approval of the governmental bodies that regulate the use of GMOs and GMO derived products.For every new task within the laboratory we must design and write up a protocol, Safe Work Procedure and Risk assessment form.)Our Laboratory is a registered

sanitary procedureDr.', 'background': '', 'description': 'What\x92s more is that MDCs can not only be used to desalinate water, but to produce electricity as well, economizing land use all the while (potentially) turning a profit.Returning to the example above, linearly extrapolating on findings from a small proof-of-concept study on MDCs, by passing that same volume of water (approximately 1/8th the size of Sydney Harbor) through an MDC one could potentially produce energy on the gigawatt scale, all the while removing 90% of salt content in a single run-through.One of the UN\x92s top sustainable developmental goals is universal access to clean water and sanitation.But with a rising world population and freshwater accounting for only 3% of the world\x92s supply, there are many challenges still left to overcome in order to meet that goal.As briefly mentioned on our page for MDCs, clean water supply is one of the UN\x92s top sustainable development goals.Though MDCs (like MFCs) typically rely on anodophilic and exoelectrogenic bacteria, by expressing shewanella-derived nanowires in our E. coli chassis, we are able to both greatly improve E. coli\x92s aptitude for desalination and open the door for further study with the model organism.Since the 1970s however, the use of electrochemically active proteins, like seen in the Shewanella and Geobacter genera has removed the need for mediators and led to improved efficiency and net positive energy production.Additionally, whereas other energy sources (sustainable or not) tend to require some degree of complex oversight (consider the litany of redundant protocols involved in nuclear power production) MFCs are largely passive, with even the most \x93high-maintenance\x94 models requiring little more than a continuous inflow of fuel (think wastewater piping).We will also use Bielefeld\x92s results as one of the benchmarks by which we will measure the success of our engineered E. coli.In 2013, Bielefeld\x92s iGEM team conducted a project on MFCs, also looking at their efficiency and the lack of engineering on the biological side to the technology.Unlike these current methods, the \x91hands-off\x92 operation of MDCs with their free energy requirements make them accessible to both developed and developing countries alike.While MFCs used to have a reputation for inefficiency, this came largely in part from the misconception that chemical mediators were absolutely necessary to transfer electrons from bacteria to the anodes of fuel cells.Additionally, they designed (but did not test) one of the cytochrome complexes required for nanowire development.Barring the discovery of large underground aquifers or other improbable events, the most likely way to meet this goal is through water desalination.While there has been significant engineering involved in the electrode design and physical construction of MFCs, preciously little has been done on the biological side.Considering the prevalence of coal and gas fired power plants, it is not hard to see how many of these problems go hand-in-hand.Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) combine the technologies used in microbial fuel cell (MFCs) with those from electrodialysis systems to create low-cost, low-maintenance, and environmentally-friendly alternatives to current industrial desalination procedures.That is to say that even with the introduction of unconventional fuels such as wastewater, discarded foodstuffs, or compost, MFCs are capable of producing energy.The challenges posed by water desalination are in no way new and until recent years have been met with many methods equally \x91historic\x92 in nature.', 'design': 'Also, due to the ease of engineering E. coli, in the future, we can add to our system in order to handle several other aspects often involved in tertiary treatment, such as nitrogen removal, chlorine removal, [16] and antibiotic and pharmaceutical removal [17].Also, the physical design of the system could allow for reduced contact between our E. coli and water in order to achieve this partial removal of phosphorus.Our system would be designed in a way for easy removal of the E. coli from the wastewater in order to harvest the phosphorus for future work.[10] Therefore,our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli could be used to remove phosphorus from the water before the water leaves the outlet pipe.[5]Therefore, our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli could be applied to remove some phosphorus from the effluent after the effluent leaves the digester.This would increase the amount of nitrogen, the limiting nutrient in the effluent, that plants can use, and therefore, less effluent (and less excess phosphorus) would need to be applied.Adding to this design, we could create a compartment housing the bioreactor with modified E. coli for uptaking phosphorus at the contaminated source of water.Our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli would be useful during tertiary treatment of the wastewater treatment process.While the amount of phosphorus that enters the tile drain system varies with soil type and season, the researchers concluded that, based on similar studies, the observed relationship between phosphorus in tile drainage systems and watersheds are likely relevant for many other watersheds in the midwestern United States.[15] Our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli system provides another option for biological phosphorus removal in tertiary treatment.[5] \x93Managing Phosphorus for Agriculture and the Environment,\x94 PennState Extension.Excess phosphorus then accumulates on the soil, and surface runoff can carry phosphorus to bodies of water.[13] The Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies are requiring reductions in the amount of phosphorus in wastewater discharge [14].[18] T. Yamashita and R. Yamamoto-Ikemoto, \x93Nitrogen and phosphorus removal from wastewater treatment plant effluent via bacterial sulfate reduction in an anoxic bioreactor packed with wood and iron,\x94 International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, vol.This way, the effluent contains both necessary nutrients, but there would be less excess phosphorus.Results indicated that tile drainage accounted for 48% of the monthly dissolved phosphorus and 40% of the monthly total phosphorus exported from the watershed.The chemical removal of phosphorus involves the formation of a precipitate by the addition of metal salts.While a small amount of phosphorus settles to the bottom of the digester, the rest of the phosphorus is in the effluent.Some of the ammonium is released as ammonia gas, and the rest of the ammonia will be incorporated into the soil, where microorganisms convert it to nitrite and then nitrate, the form in which most plants uptake nitrogen.[14] Environmental Protection Agency, "Advanced Wastewater Treatment to Achieve Low Concentration of Phosphorus", Office of Water and Watersheds, Seattle, WA, 2007.[8]While tile drainage systems are beneficial due to their ability to increase crop yields and reduce surface runoff, they also are problematic due to their export of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides, such as atrazine, into waterways.[6]) Therefore, ammonia in the effluent will not be released as gas, and microorganisms in the soil can convert the nitrite to nitrate.[9] An eight-year study on six different tile drains and a watershed outlet within the Upper Big Walnut Creek watershed in central Ohio concluded that tile drainage systems\x92 contribution to phosphorus in surface water is not negligible, as previously thought.Tertiary treatment refers to any additional treatment after secondary treatment, and this often involves removal of impurities and nutrients, such as phosphorus.[2] S. M. Mitchell, N. Kennedy, J. Ma, G. Yorgey, C. Kruger, J. L. Ullman, and C. Frear, \x93Anaerobic Digestion Effluents And Processes: The Basics,\x94 Washington State University Extension, FS171E, pp.Another major nutrient for crop, nitrogen, is also present in the effluent, although some of the organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium.[10] K. King, M. Williams and N. Fausey, "Contributions of Systematic Tile Drainage to Watershed-Scale Phosphorus Transport", Journal of Environmental Quality, vol.[15] Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, "Phosphorus Treatment and Removal Technology", Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, St. Paul, MN, 2006.An effluent containing most of the nutrients in manure passes through the digester and is collected for use in fields.About 25% of farmland in the United States and Canada uses tile drainage because over-saturated soils provide insufficient aeration and thus inhibit crop growth.The annual flow-weighted mean for dissolved reactive phosphorus in tile drainage systems was 0.12 mg/L, and the annual flow-weighted mean for total phosphorus in tile drainage systems was 0.15 mg/L.Our system would be designed to attach to the end of the outlet pipe.This is a problem because when cow manure is used as fertilizer, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient.Also, we would add genes (based on Nanjing-China\x92s 2013 iGEM project) to our E. coli to absorb and degrade atrazine.[2] The methane gas is then collected for use as bioenergy.By placing trzN downstream of the ribosome switch, we would only produce trzN when necessary.The precipitate, and therefore the phosphorus, can then be removed.[4]Still, most of the nutrient content from the manure stays in the effluent.[11] Also, in the future, we could work on developing a genetic system for nitrogen remediation to incorporate into our E. coli.The phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) then store 5 to 30% of their dry weight as phosphorus.Our system can also be adapted for nitrification, converting ammonia to water soluble nitrite, by adding the genes for ammonia monooxygenase (BBa_K1067003), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase(BBa_K1067004), and cytochromes A and X (BBa_K1067002).', 'human_practice': 'Coming away from this meeting we began to focus more on design criteria such as how much phosphorus we needed to retrieve, began looking at products that already existed, and broadened our scope of potential application.They gave us feedback and information we would need to provide them in order to pitch our product on an industrial scale.From the outset of our project, we understood that we would receive pushback regarding the use of E. coli in water.Based on advice we received, we made posters to explain our project and set up a booth at the Wabash River Festival in West Lafayette to discuss the phosphorus problem, our solution, and what it means with people at the festival.He also encouraged us look into the phosphorus cycle and see where our Implementation could have the largest impact.Additionally, Andi provided us with information on 2 stage ditches as both an alternative method of phosphorus reclamation and as a potential area for application of our method in conjunction with the ditches.From this discussion, we widened our focus to the entire phosphorus cycle, started looking at mass balance systems for phosphorus, and set up meetings with people involved in various stages of water cleanup like the USDA lab on campus, the Lily Nature Center, and the West Lafayette Waste Water Treatment Facility.He also talked to us about his work with phosphorus, which gave us insight into our design.He encouraged us to focus on the larger context of our potential solution; focus on the mass balance of the system, energy usage, environmental impacts, and the entirety of the water cycle.As we did more research, we found that these beads were ideal for our project as the E. coli would be unlikely to escape and would be viable for up to 4 weeks.Below you can find specific design or direction changes we made based on our meetings.After discussions with scientists and businessman at DAS, we decided to talk to policy experts in the government.As Purdue President Mitch Daniels said, \x93It\x92s only innovation when it is useful to someone.\x94At this meeting with the USDA we narrowed down design criteria for a prototype phosphorus reclaim module.This prompted us to return to the USDA to talk about the specifics of phosphorus application and the sustainability of current farming practices.This started a dialogue with the public and gave us valuable insight on further communication and presentations.Our next stop in our discovery was the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Lab.We resolved to design our system in such a way that the phosphorus was tightly held but also easily removable.We then held a design meeting in whoch we iterated to find a design that the USDA would develop for us.Andi Hodaj discussed tile drains in depth and gave us good information on how we could implement a phosphorus reclamation module within one.This information again broadened our thoughts on potential application and gave us enough information of tile drains to begin brainstorming a potential prototype.We met with the Chief Science Liason of Bindley Biosicence Center, Dr. Thomas Sors, who was very helpful throughout our project.Additionally, they discussed tile drains as a potential area for application of our system and encouraged us to attend Andi Hodaj\x92s thesis defense.We attended a seminar on phosphorus given by Dr. Kevin King in which he talked about the \x93stickiness\x94 of phosphates.We set up a conference call in which we discussed our early ideas for a phosphorus accumulating E. coli that could be used on agricultural fields.Most importantly, he talked to us about system modularity, which led to us designing our system so that many different projects could utilize it.We were lucky in our discovery process to stumble upon the 2016 Midwest Clean Energy Forum that was held on campus.We talked to one of our advisors who recommended we speak to Dr. Jay Garland at the EPA.This helped us meet some of the design criteria that we arrived at with other experts.Our first visit was to Dow AgroSciences (DAS) where we presented our still rough project idea.He explained that this contributes to a buildup of phosphates in the system that doesn\x92t happen with nitrogen.However, we learned that limestone is ineffective as it leeches phosphorus after sometime.More importantly, we started to look into possible ways to ensure safety in using E. coli to clean up water.', 'modeling': 'Figure 4: Concentration profiles of intracellular phosphate at equally-spaced time points in the model.Figure 3: Concentration profiles of extracellular phosphate at equally-spaced time points in the model.Two meshes are then defined: one to model phosphate concentration outside of the cells and one to model phosphate concentration within cells at all linear positions within the bioreactor at all time points for the length of the model (total running time is a preset parameter).The concentration is normalized to the instream concentration of phosphate.Additionally, the average intracellular concentration of phosphate across all cells in the bioreactor is calculated and plotted against time (Figure 5).The cells reach their maximum capacity of phosphate sooner as the flow rate slows.The overall bioreactor efficiency was also calculated at various flow rates (Figure 8).Figure 8: Bioreactor efficiency over time at various flow rates (0.5 mL/s, 1 mL/s, 5 mL/s, 10 mL/s, and 50 mL/s).As the concentration nears the maximum, the uptake rates slows and the reactor efficiency drops.To determine the overall efficiency of the reactor, the exiting concentration of phosphate is divided by the original, instream concentration, and plotted against time in Figure 6.The effect of flow rate on the bioreactor was evaluated by simulating various flowrates (Figure 7).Figure 7: Effect of flow rate on phosphate uptake over model simulation time.This assumption is valid because the genes are designed to be under constituitive control, resulting in a steady-state concentration of the membrane transport proteins.Concentration profiles of phosphate at various time points are seen in Figure 3.The profiles indicate a noticeable difference in uptake rates at various points in the reactor over time.Similarly, concentration profiles across the reactor of phosphate within the cells are plotted in Figure 4.To purpose of the model is to inform design regarding the viability of the PAO system, particularly to predict how long a single PAO reactor is useful before needing to induce the phosphate export subsystem.An analytical model using finite difference methodology was developed to predict performance of our phosphate uptake system over time.Where Cout is the extracellular phosphate concentration at position x and time t, Cin is the intracellular phosphate concentration at the same position x and time t, Cmax is the maximum phosphate capacity of the cells, and k is the phosphate uptake constant.The reactor peaks at 83.7% efficiency before decreasing as the cells near their phosphate capacity.This plot embodies the usefulness of the model, as the reactor efficiency is a measure of system performance.The concentration is normalized to the instream phosphate concentration.The concentration is normalized to the instream concentration of phosphate.The plot shows the accumulation of phosphate of the entire bioreactor over time.The maximum phosphate capacity of each differential volume slice is determined with cell density and maximum phosphate capacity per cell using Equation 4.The cellular concentration is assumed to be 108 cfu/mL and the phosphate concentration per cell is assumed to be 4*10-14 mol/cfu.Given that the width of the annuls is 0.7 cm and the flow rates are relatively low, the shear stresses are unlikely to create a large velocity gradient.It is assumed that the uptake coefficient remains constant throughout all position and time points in the model.Third, relevant parameters, namely the instream phosphate concentration, are pulled from the literature.Future iterations of the model would rely on experimental data to get a more realistic value for k, the phosphate uptake coefficient.The model is then run over the preset time parameter.Future iterations could also inform the value of k further and explicitly define it as a function of plasmid copy number, promoter strength, and other factors.pPerCell = 4E-14; % maximum phosphate concentration per cell [g/cfu]pMassConcIn = 5E-6; % initial phosphate concentration [g/mL]pMolarMass =

Intracellular ,  Phosphate Concentration }, FontSize ,fontsize, FontWeight , bold );For a replacement cutoff of 50% efficiency, a flow rate of 1 mL/s provides the longest lifetime of the reactor.Preliminary modeling of the system has provided a general idea of the system performance and how often filters would have to be changed for effective operation.Performance of the system was predicted using a finite difference model.It is assumed cell growth over the time course of the model is negligible and therefore is not accounted for.It is assumed flow velocity is the same at all radial positions in the reactor (perfect plug flow).The differential volume is calculated based off of the volumetric flow rate (Q) as seen in Equation 3.This enables the creation of a mesh such that an entire differential volume is moved through over the course of the discrete time step.', 'notebook': '0.5µL MgCl2 was not added to this PCR reaction, and it ran for 20 cycles.Began performing gel

yesterday, and the production of more LB agar plates with ampicillin closed out the week in Bindley Bioscience Center.This garden needed some weeding and re-planting to be in tip-top shape again.THURSDAY, JUNE 16Team members were busy in the lab completing transformations of phosphorus genes, more PCR, autoclaving, and inoculation of transformed InterLab genes.In the afternoon, a few team members also visited the West Lafayette Wastewater Treatment facility, where they learned about the local area\x92s methods for phosphorus removal featuring their newly-implemented chemical system.THURSDAY, JULY 29Additional trials of media and various water samples were run on both the lachat and ICP as team members were trained in their use.Work continued on both the spring publication and protein profiles for the wiki.WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8 Formal lab meeting #1 was a success with the most highly prioritized goal for the upcoming week to find or generate relevant numbers for the project including necessary flow rates for a microbial fuel cell, an appropriate density of E. coli within it, etc.Further testing of the prototype will include the determination of the proper substrate to contain E. coli, optimum temperature and pH, and best water flow rate.THURSDAY, JULY 14Thursday morning began with celebration as all of the previous day\x92s transformations worked with multiple colonies appearing on every plate.Young scientists tried their hands at pipetting, mixing colored water in eppendorf tubes.MONDAY, JULY 11After a successful weekend participating in the Wabash River Fest, the team jumped back into lab work, plating a new culture of Shewie, miniprepping a promoter for use with digestion the next day, and preparing glycerol stock cultures of successfully transformed parts.Exeter and UChicago are onboard to help with database entries and protein characterization, and SVCE will distribute a survey about wastewater management practices.Through a meeting with Dr. Ron Semmel, a Monsanto scientist, the team acquired useful contacts and information regarding local phosphorus and nitrogen soil concentrations.MONDAY, MAY 23Day 1 on the job\x96the morning began with a tour of Bindley Bioscience Center for the new interns (Barrett, Caleigh, Emma, and Paige), during which Susan (the world\x92s best receptionist) kindly showed the fledgling researchers

completed in addition to an establishment of a protocol for completing lab notebooks.The day also brought continued research into the development of a model to both inform experimental decisions and make future predictions.FRIDAY, JULY 22During the week, the team found out that IDT was unable to synthesize another nanowire gene, cancelling the order and decisively tabling the wet lab work for the nanowire side of the project for this competition cycle.Look for explanation no further than the team\x92s newly-released glossary of synthetic biology and iGEM terms hosted on the Experiment page.With the new bioreactor prototype, several protocols needed to be written including a standard for measuring water flow and a process for system maintenance.PCR products included Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK1 homolog part 1, PPK1 homolog part 2, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.PCR products included Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK1 homolog part 1, PPK1 homolog part 2, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.If lab work continues to go well, this may be something to pursue in the fall.TUESDAY, JULY 12Wet lab work consisted of the digestion and ligation of all three remaining phosphorus genes in preparation for transformations into E. coli.Performed transformations for both the 3:1 and 6:1 (insert:vector) ligations of Pit homolog A, Pit homolog B, Pit homolog C, PPK2 homolog B, PPK2 homolog C, ATP-independent PPGK, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.It involved the creation of a guide for phosphorus on the Experiment page, so if you want to become familiar with the differences between total phosphorus, orthophosphate, and polyphosphate, feel free to check it out.THURSDAY, JULY 21The lab hosted Peter Oladipupo, a Mandela Washington Fellow, answering questions regarding the project as it relates to the generation of energy.With equipment, it is possible to operate without reliance upon the lab space of other Bindley Bioscience Center scientists, lending additional flexibility to the projects iGEMmers are able to complete.Phosphorus genes arrived, and the team got to work on PCR amplification in the afternoon.Wiki design was also discussed to get this critical project element up and running ASAP.TUESDAY, JUNE 14Lab work for Tuesday included the mixing of gels for later electrophoresis, the miniprep of promoters that were PCR\x92ed previously, and continued InterLab transformations.WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15Meeting day!Project write-ups for the Experiment campaign were completed, as was an application for a grant from SYNENERGENE for advanced human practices.THURSDAY, JUNE 2The Experiment online crowdfunding platform was submitted for approval in the morning, and an order for both competent cells and primers was placed.Bacterial growth was only present on the positive control, and all the transformation

Bands indicating product were present for Pit homolog A, Pit homolog C, and PPK2 homolog C. Gel was then stored at 4°C.Performed gel extraction for Pit homolog A, Pit homolog C, and PPK2 homolog C from gel from July 1.Thank you to Dr. Steve Evans, Mr. Mike Doody, and DAS administration for their support in realizing the dream of a self-sufficient, independent lab for the sole use of undergraduate iGEM students.Gel was run at room temperature and 85 V. Bands indicating product were found for PPK1 homolog part 2, PPK2 homolog C, PPGK homolog, and PPX2 homolog.before delving into more complex issues of function, and gene design specifics.TUESDAY, MAY 24Nine out of ten genes needed for luxury phosphorus uptake were ordered at the conclusion of Day 2!Mental effort for the day was directed toward understanding E. coli\x91s Pho regulon, the system of genes that control phosphorus within the organism, in an effort to determine which specific sequences of DNA may be helpful to up-regulate in the synthetic microbes to greater improve their efficiency.WEDNESDAY, JULY 13 The bioreactor prototype was complete!Colony PCR and sequencing to confirm the transformation of phosphorus genes into E. coli were also begun, with completion planned to coincide with the conclusion of next week.FRIDAY, JULY 30Focus was placed on brainstorming possible development strategies of silica beads.Denny Luan, a founder of Experiment, the crowdfunding website utilized to raise money for lab supplies, spoke with the team on the day\x92s second call.Via Skype, the team established a collaboration agreement with Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\x92s iGEM team, aiding them with fluorescent microscopy in exchange for help characterizing some proteins.In the afternoon, several team members volunteered with the Wabash River Enhancement Corporation (WREC) by aiding in the upkeep of a rain garden in Lafayette designed to use plants to stop pollutants from infiltrating the Wabash.A bioreactor brainstorming session with USDA-NSERL staff Dr. Ashley Hammac, Stan Livingston, and Scott McAfee left team members enthused about the prototype to come later in the week.The team was busy in the lab making and running gels for phosphorus and re-transforming phosphorus genes after Thursday\x92s inoculations proved less than satisfactory.Many thanks to the staff of the NSERL (National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory) for making it possible.The prototype consists of two 5-gallon buckets, an aquarium pump and outflow tube to maintain constant water level and flow, and three separate ports around the base to channel water from the main reservoir into water filters that will eventually contain modified E. coli cartridges.See the diagram below for an explanation of the method.WEDNESDAY, JULY 20 Wednesday\x92s focus was the development of a protocol for the quantification of phosphorus both intracellularly and extracellularly.Thank you, Dr. Huang and Dr. Hammac!Word was received later in the afternoon that the Experiment proposal had been approved; the campaign launches June 9!MONDAY, JUNE 6Monday morning got rolling with the attendance of ABE PhD student Dr. Andi Hodaj\x92s thesis defense regarding two-stage ditches as a tool to reduce nutrient loads.The bacteria will be immobilized within the matrix of silica fibers while phosphorus is still able to pass through, making this solution ideal for easy input and retrieval of E. coli from the bioreactor system.Interns learned how to optimize codons using IDT both automatically and manually, checking for segments such as EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI, and HINDIII that should not be present in coding regions of constructs, as these sequences code for restriction sites.WEDNESDAY, MAY 25 A review of sterile technique and iGEM kit DNA extractions in the lab comprised a majority of the morning.Phosphorus is to be collected in these chambers, and effluent is controlled by the valves at the point where water flows from the filters.It was discovered that the facility is newly permitted for phosphorus removal; however, a chemical method as opposed to a biological one will be implemented August 1 for both political and financial reasons.PCR was completed for 3 phosphorus genes whose gel electrophoresis analyses were unclear when attempted over the weekend.An afternoon Skype call with the University of Exeter in England topped off the day as teams exchanged greetings, project synopses, and ideas for future collaboration.FRIDAY, JUNE 24A Shewanella oneidensis culture, generously donated by Argonne National Laboratory, arrived amidst great celebration on Friday morning.Here\x92s a quick summary of the goings-ons in short paragraph form:The team visited Imagination Station in downtown Lafayette regarding the possibility of volunteering both this summer and continuing forward.Corresponding with this endeavor, many bottles of Tris-HCl buffer, the media in which phosphorus-eating E. coli will be suspended, were created and autoclaved for future use.TUESDAY, JULY 26The week continued by learning to make methanol-free bioencapsulation beads using the sol-gel method.Thank you to everyone who has aided our cause!MONDAY, JUNE 20The week began with a strong focus on human practices as the team fleshed out 3 ideas.It was great fun for all parties involved as passersby learned about DNA, built (and ate) their own licorice and marshmallow double helix models, and asked questions about synthetic biology and the phosphorus cycle.With all phosphorus genes successfully transformed, the team can now move forward with characterizing proteins.A reporter from local WLFI 18 TV news visited the lab, as well, and the story, related to Florida\x92s algal blooms, aired on the nightly news.Purdue\x92s two-stage ditch utilized in Dr. Hodaj\x92s was established in 2012 and drains 660 acres; it may be a possible implementation point for the project\x92s biological method.After practice forming the beads, the team switched to a different method that could be more easily controlled and manipulated.This week, culture growth will begin after air tanks to sustain the anaerobic culture arrive.TUESDAY, JULY 19Mid-week discussion centered around using the sol-gel method to suspend E. coli in silica beads with which to fill containers external to the main containment area of the bioreactor.The team has been trying to find the proper ratio of these two ingredients so beads solidify at an appropriate rate\x96too slowly, and an amorphous silica blob forms in the bottom of the mineral oil into which the beads drop; too quickly, and the mixture hardens inside the tubing through which it is dispensed.Analytical labs, rain-producing machines for the purpose of studying erosion patterns, bioreactors, and anaerobic growth chambers were among the cutting-edge technologies the team observed.Tweet @PurdueBiomakers to let the team know what you think.MONDAY, JULY 18In collaboration with Exeter, the team will be growing up last summer\x92s killswitch genetic construct under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.In the best interest of keeping a sterile work environment, the team refrained from strewing confetti across the bench, although it would\x92ve been both fun and festive.Dow AgroSciences generously donated various lab supplies to the iGEM workspace that the team was thrilled to pick up in Indianapolis on Friday morning.The plan for the upcoming week is to characterize individual proteins and begin conducting tests to determine the optimal substrate for E. coli to inhabit in the bioreactor\x92s external chambers.They are excited about the project and are looking into Chicago-area venues as the Purdue team investigates Indianapolis as a potential host city.The remainder of the day was spent working on gene design via Benchling, researching potential assays, and meeting with Drs.Additionally, the team is excited to announce that their submission for a SYNENERGENE Grant-Funded Collaboration proposal was selected!The gel was run at room temperature and at 90 V. Performed digestion and ligation (both 3:1 and 5:1) on the Anderson promoter J23106, six of our phosphorus-related genes, and PSB1A3.Transformed the six phosphorus-gene constructs ligated yesterday into E. coli, .Nanowires will be revisited during the school year\x96strong side project potential!MONDAY, JULY 25Preliminary trials of testing for phosphorus using the lachat and the ICP-OES at the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory began.The rest of the afternoon was spent working on action items from the meeting and printing the spring publication, which is FINISHED.THURSDAY, JUNE 9Team members Barrett Davis, Paige Rudin, and Suraj Mohan attended the Regional Clean Energy Innovation Forum held at Ross-Ade Stadium.If this event is pursued, it would be a day-long conference at the end of July.The third idea is in regards to the Great North American Skype Series (G-NASS), a \x93Skype roulette\x94 to foster inter-team communication.Cool temperatures slow the reaction, so the team has also tried completing the process in the cold room with mineral oil warmed on a hot plate, but to no avail.Some golden rules of sterile technique: Always wipe down the lab bench with 70% ethanol before beginning; work as close to the flame as possible, as it creates a sterile \x93bubble\x94; and get into and out of pipette tip boxes as quickly as possible to keep them sterile.Interns followed an existing protocol to make plain LB agar, LB agar with ampicillin, and LB broth, culminating in the pouring and storing of too many plates to count.Additionally, the team met with representatives of the Purdue Foundry regarding the possibility of developing a business model for the phosphorus removal system.See last week\x92s previous post for more information; the Experiment page can be found here.The first, iNAC, the iGEM North American Conference, was sparked by the observation that many more European than North American teams medal, and of those that medal, the proportion of golds is substantially higher for Europe.The theme the team took away from the day is best summarized with the words of Purdue President Mitch Daniels during his opening remarks: \x93It\x92s only an innovation when it\x92s useful to someone.\x94 How can new technology of nanowires and microbial fuel cells be integrated efficiently into established systems?Additionally, the hunt for assays continued for both phosphorus and nanowire constructs.The lachat measures orthophosphate, or soluble reactive phosphorus, while the ICP measures total phosphorus, the entirety of phosphorus contained in a sample.Due to low concentrations below 45 ng/µL, the colonies containing these plasmids were reinoculated.Performed minipreps on two cultures of E. coli containing the plasmid PBR322 and one sample of PACYC4.A graduate student in the lab worked with team members to describe and demonstrate the protocol.Transformations were done into E. coli.Inoculated transformations of the temperature sensitive promoter K608351 and tsPurple reporter (RBS+coding+terminator) K1357008 into LB-chloramphenicol.Inoculated successful transformations from October 9 into LB- chloramphenicol.', 'protocol': 'in a hood or near a flame) do NOT use heat to dry the smear because cells might popOnce dry, pass slide through a flame 1-2 times to fix cells to the glass slideEnsure the cells do not come into contact with the flame, only the underside of the slide (slide should be just hot enough that you can hold it in your hands without causing burns)Completely cover the smear with Solution 1 for 30 seconds and rinse for 1 sec with ddH2OCompletely cover the smear with Solution 2 for 1 minute, rinse well with ddH2O and blot dry.Examine under oil immersion using the 100X objective with brightfield illumination (do not use phase contrast)If using EVOS, do not use any fluorescent illumination--natural light will workWritten up by Barrett Davis, Emma Foster, and Paige RudinTo prepare E. coli cultures for phosphorus uptake characterizationGrow up cells in LB Broth with shaking at 37°C for 12h (25 mL)Pipette 100 uL into a well;

Control: A Simple Approach" [http://www.iowaruralwater.org/tools_tips/toni_glymp/Filaments.pdf].Next, add 750 µL Buffer PE, centrifuge for 1 minute, and then discard the flow-through.If you are planning on running samples larger than 15 ?L on the gel (about what one large-toothed comb well will hold), you can carefully tape together multiple teeth on the well comb together to create a larger well.The liquid should be discarded and then liquid cell culture should be added to the Eppendorf tube with the remaining pellet.Bubbles can be removed by sucking them up using a pipet.Immediately rinse out the flask that contained the hot agarose with water.Mix by gentle vortexing and incubate for 15 minutes at 25°C till the colour of the solution changes from blue to purple.CRITICAL STEP: The

the migration distance \x96 shorter times equal shorter migration distances and lower resolutions.The agarose should not dissolve in the TAE at this point.This has two key objectives.With standard 1 cm pathlength spectrophotometers, the reading is still instrument dependent (see above).Swirl the plate to move the glass beads around and evenly coat the media with the liquid suspension of cells.Add this amount of water to a PCR tube.Transfer competent cells to ice from the -80? freezer.The side of the gel with the wells should be facing towards the black side (anode) of the chamber.If a red color develops, add sulfuric acid solution until color just disappears.Add 1 mL of sulfuric acid solution and 0.4 g of ammonium persulfate.Adjust as necessary, but beware that pH will drop with the next step.To measure your standard LUDOX Abs600 you must use the same cuvettes, plates and volumes (suggestion: use 100 ?l for plate reader measurement and 1 mL for spectrophotometer measurement) that you will use in your cell based assays.Scatter the cell suspension in drops on the plate.Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge dry column again for 1min (room temp,

benchtop.To check this after the incubation period pipetted up and down \x96 if any particulates are visible in the pipette tip continue to incubate overnight.[Note: it is important that the FITC is properly dissolved.Using this and the other given volumes, calculate amount of nuclease free water to be added (for 1?L of DNA solution this is 32?L of nuclease free water).Repeat this step again then measure final DNA concentrations with a Nanodrop machine, using EB Buffer as a blank.However, the migration rate is not linearly related to the fragment size so different gel densities yield different resolutions.Incubate for 4 min.Note: The buffers listed below are recommended.Using the hot plate, boil the solution gently for 30 to 40 minutes, when the total volume is 10 mL.Ensure the water level in the bioreactor is staying at the constant level around the overflow port before opening any outlet streams.If sequences don t match up when you check your sequencing, it may have been because of an error in PCR because even the high fidelity polymerase isn t always 100% Sam Lee and IDT (https://www.idtdna.com/pages/docs/default-source/user-guides-and-protocols/gblocks-amplification.pdf?sfvrsn=12)For a 50?L reaction, calculate the volume of DNA that will be added (recommend using 1?L

Seal the bottle with its cap and autoclave tape and put it in the autoclave for a liquid30 cycle (approx.Let the effluent run into the large beaker while adjusting valves.Then, ligate the two constructs and the linearized plasmid together.Monitor protein elution by measuring the absorbance of the fractions at 280nm or by Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Reagent (Product No.Use the Equilibration Buffer to adjust the total volume to be ? 2 resin-bed volumes.After about a minute, move tubes around in ice because the nearby ice has probably melted.We are not allowed in the lab before nine or after five thirty so these are the times we will be doing it but whatever suits you is fine.Repeat the previous step and centrifuge for 2 minutes to remove residual wash buffer.Add distilled water to bring the total volume back to 50 mL.First, add LyseBlue to Buffer P1 at a ratio of 1:1000.Hit the Run button to start running the gel.Alternative: For more throughput or shorter run times, 2 half gels (2 sets of combs per gel) can be run at a setting of 110V, 30 min.However, with the optics on the imager, the effects of this are negligible.Next, add 4 µL of DNA were to the experimental Eppendorf tubes.To consistently measure flow rate from the bioreactor systemPrepare bioreactor by ensuring tubing is tightly sealed, filter canisters are sitting upright on the table, and the pump is on and refilling the bioreactor.Leave the current setting on the power unit alone.There should be cell growth on the positive control and no cell growth on the negative control.Extraction

0.21 grams of agarose powder in 30 mL of 1X TAE in an Erlenmeyer flask or other microwaveable vessel.', 'result': 'The suitability of the linear regression is also supported by the root mean square error, which, at 0.02, is relatively close to 0.Figure 6: the results indicate that the samples for E. coli containing PPK2 C (both PSB1C3 and PSB1A3), PPX2 (both PSB1C3 and PSB1A3), and PPGK accumulate less polyphosphate than unmodified E. coli, and samples for E. coli containing Pit homolog A and PPGK ATPI accumulate more polyphosphate than the unmodified E. coli.The results, reflective of 72 hours of E. coli suspension in Tris-HCl buffered minimal media, indicate that PPX2 effectively exported phosphorus from the cell compared to the exportation of phosphorus from unmodified E. coli because PPX2 culture demonstrated a higher extracellular phosphorus concentration.Figure 5A standard curve for amount of phosphate per 300 µl of solution was generated using sodium phosphate glass type 45.No forward primer was used, as we did not have a forward primer that would work for PSB1A3 at the time of sequencing.Figure 3.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformation of PPK2 homolog C in the plasmid PSB1A3 indicate that PPK2 homolog C plasmid has the correct sequence.The sequencing for plasmids in the PSB1C3 backbone were done with the standard BioBrick primers VR and VF2.PPGK ATPI is not working as expected, as PPGK ATPI, like PPGK, transfers a phosphate group from polyphosphate to glucose.In the future, we should extract polyphosphate granules from a large sample of unmodified E. coli in order to obtain a normal distribution curve to which our modified samples could be compared.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformations of PPX2 homolog in the plasmid PSB1A3 indicate that the PPX2 homolog contains the correct sequence.Analysis of Phosphorus Uptake, Accumulation, and ExportationFigure 4: The amount of extracellular total phosphorus in Tris-HCl buffered minimal media after extended 72-hour phosphorus transportation assay with E. coli.Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to quantify the importation and exportation of phosphorus by modified and unmodified E. coli with results detailed in Figure 4.The sequencing for plasmids in the PSB1A3 backbone were done with a reverse primer that targets the his operon terminator on PSB1A3, and so the reaction should proceed, regardless of whether or not an insert was present in the plasmid.: The results of Sanger sequencing for the transformations of PPX2 homolog in the plasmid PSB1C3 indicate that the PPX2 homolog contains the correct sequence.Figure 3.c.Unmodified E. coli served as a negative control to which PPX2 in PSB1A3 backbone was compared.Figure 1: Transformation of PPX2 homolog on PSB1A3 plasmid into E. coli grown on an LB agar plate with ampicillin.Figure 2: Transformation of PPK2 homolog C on PSB1A3 plasmid into E. coli grown on an LB agar plate with ampicillin.Figure 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate the growth of modified E. coli on LB agar plates containing ampicillin.The coefficient of determination (R2), at 0.975, is relatively close to 1, which indicates that the linear regression is a suitable equation for estimating the relationship between concentration of polyphosphate and absorbance at 630 nm.Meanwhile, these results also suggest that Pit A is working as expected, as Pit A is predicted to transport phosphate into the cell.This antibiotic was shown to be effective in controlling the growth of bacteria that did not take up the modified plasmid with antibiotic resistance, as no growth was found on the negative control.The success of these transformations, as confirmed through plasmid sequencing, is discussed below.Plasmid DNA was then obtained for colonies resulting from transformations and brought to the Purdue Genomics Core Facility for low throughput Sanger sequencing.While PPK2 homolog C\x92s preference for polyphosphate hydrolysis or synthesis is unknown, the low concentration of polyphosphate in cells containing PPK2 homolog C suggests that PPK2 C favors polyphosphate hydrolysis to phosphorylate nucleoside diphosphates (or nucleoside monophosphates).', 'safety': 'In its application, the main goals of Purdue iGEM\x92s phosphate bioremediation

equivalents from the cell that you wouldn\x92t be able to get rid of otherwise (say if you can\x92t access oxygen due to the need for oxygen sensitive enzymes in terephthalic acid degradation).Ask

Typically, the yield of electricity from a fuel cell is fairly small, so even a mountain of PET bottles is not going to be a solution to the world\x92s energy problems.Dr. Weaver also helped with the 3D printer that works with UV light, located in 60 Oxford Street, part of Harvard s School John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).Girguis also encouraged us to consider the economic viability of our fuel cell project.To help illustrate his point, he discussed his own research and explained that in the case of electronic devices in remote locations at the bottom of the ocean, microbial fuel cells can be more cost-effective than alternatives such as batteries that need to be constantly replaced.Erika Parra, Ph.D. Parra is an associate of Harvard s Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.Bielefeld iGEM 2013 Their work on blueprints for a 3D-printed microbial fuel cell and with exogenous mediators provided a useful foundation on which we built our project.She has extensive experience working with fuel cells and was kind enough to visit our lab space at the Wyss to help us assemble our cell.Dr.He noted some design problems in the blueprints for the microbial fuel cell parts.Sara Hamel Ph.D.: We obtained her contact information through one of our mentors, Bom Pichet Praveschotinunt, who said that she could help us with the printing and building of the MFC.Oxford iGEM 2015 They showed that YebF, a protein naturally secreted to the extracellular medium in E.

Girguis: Professor Joshi suggested reaching out to Professor Girguis, a member of Harvard s faculty who has previously led an iGEM team.We would also like to thank the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which generously supported our summer research.How many genes are involved in terephthalic acid degradation?You might want to ask yourselves the following questions: how much do you care about degrading terephthalic acid and how much do you care about making electricity?What follows is a message Barstow addressed to our team: \x93That\x92s a really good question.Also, my guess is as good as yours on whether E. coli can degrade (or be engineered to degrade) terephthalic acid.Prof. Eiji Masai: He is the corresponding author of papers where researchers attempt to sequence the TPA degradation and uptake genes of the Comamonas sp.James Weaver: We initially visited the machine shop and they directed us to Dr. Weaver to help us optimize Bielefeld\x92s MFC design.', 'background': '', 'description': 'When plastic like PET enters the ocean, it has detrimental effects on ocean ecosystems and can travel up the food chain even to the seafood on our plates.Because of its popularity, PET is also one of the predominant sources of plastic pollution.While PET pollutes both the land and sea, the majority of PET litter ends up in the ocean.For researchers like these who are investigating the scope and distribution of PET in the ocean, Plastiback presents a novel and sustainable way to track ocean PET, while also using non-toxic methods to degrade PET!Plastiback sustainably breaks down and gives feedback on where PET, a type of plastic, is located.', 'design': 'Constructed BioBricks for PETase and confirmed presence of protein using sfGFPConstructed BioBricks with secretion systems for PETaseValidated PETase expression through SDS Page and Western blotValidated PETase enzymatic activity through pNPB substrate assayCharacterized growth of three bacteria species in TPA minimal mediaDemonstrated TPA signal can be detected by voltage increase in microbial fuel cellWe met all of the deliverable requirements: team wiki, poster, presentation, project attribution, registry parts page, sample submission, safety forms, and judging forms.1.The design and direction of our project were directly influenced by the feedback we received from both The Seabin Project and microbial fuel cell experts we interviewed throughout the duration of our project.Moreover, after interviewing Professor Peter Girguis, Ph.D. we modified the design of our project, particularly the usage of the electrical output of our microbial fuel cell.)VALIDATED PART/ VALIDATED CONTRIBUTION [Completed] (pelB + sfGFP + PETase; PET-degrading enzyme, origin I. sakaiensis)  We collaborated with team Northeastern by characterizing each other\x92s constructs.', 'human_practice': 'Professor Peter Girguis  lab specializes in studying deep-sea organisms and has experience developing underwater fuel cells to function as power sources.1 When we told Girguis about our plan to use terephthalic acid to generate electricity, he immediately warned us current fuel cell technology is only capable of producing limited amounts of electricity and that we should take this to account when determining the precise application of our reactor.While talking to Professor Derek Lovley, we learned it was important for our cell to be anaerobic; if the cell was in contact with atmospheric air, the bacteria could transfer electrons to available oxygen molecules instead of our electrode, thereby preventing the cell from producing a current.By talking to Professor Lovley, we were able to integrate his advice into our experimental design for our microbial fuel cell (MFC) and find a fuel cell that is airtight.What we found out we could do, though, was power an LED signal or a GPS ping, which we integrated into our final design of Plastiback.We confirmed that the electricity we would produce in our system would be much more valuable as a PET-detecting signal, rather than a supplementing power source for the Seabin or other oceanic device.As mentioned in our human practices page, we discussed future collaborations with Dr. Sergio Ruiz-Halpern, Head of Science at Seabin.Knowing that our PET-degrading bacteria, I. Sakaiensis originated at a recycling plant, we thought to contact labs that have discovered bacteria in wastewater treatment facilities.Because Seabin is still in development, we brainstormed possible future integrations of our sensor device with their platform.This encouraged us to try thinking of locations where we could find bacteria capable of metabolizing terephthalic acid.Thus, the energy produced by our MFC will help send a signal back to researchers to indicate the location of plastic in the ocean.We had up to this point wanted to use the electricity generated by our MFC to power a floating device like the Seabin.And, while the Seabin may be too large to suck in microplastics, our system would actually work better with microplastic because they are easier to break down.', 'modeling': 'Using the paper as a blueprint, our team constructed a model in Matlab (code available at the bottom of this page) that enables its users to enter values for adsorption, desorption, and catalysis constants and values for initial substrate and enzyme concentrations to immediately receive values for the Michaelis-Menten constant and the percentage of substrate that is bound to the enzyme at any point in time.The paper, "Calculation of Protein Extinction Coefficients from Amino Acid Sequence Data",5 guided us through the process of finding this crucial coefficient for a wavelength of 280 nm and allowed us to use the number of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine amino acids present in PETase to arrive at an extinction coefficient of 39170 M-1 cm-1.As our team and mentors investigated more sophisticated variations of Michaelis-Menten, we uncovered a highly relevant paper, "Surface Enzyme Kinetics for Biopolymer Microarrays: a Combination of Langmuir and Michaelis-Menten Concepts"4.Since our assessment of enzyme kinetics was purely comparative (that is, we judged the efficiency of surface kinetics by comparing them to kinetics in solution), we focused our investigation on the parameters that are unique to surfaces: adsorption and desorption.Supporting Future Experiments: Calculating Extinction CoefficientsDuring our wet lab work with PETase this summer, we managed to successfully isolate the enzyme.To understand conditions involving small pieces of plastic, our team relied on Michaelis-Menten, a widely-applied model for enzyme kinetics.Although we have the necessary tools to measure the optical density (OD) of a solution that contains PETase, OD measurements are not sufficient on their own to determine concentration because we do not know how much light the enzyme absorbs.This is where modelling comes into the picture."Surface Enzyme Kinetics for Biopolymer Microarrays: A Combination of Langmuir and Michaelis-Menten Concepts."Though PETase is the most efficient PET-degrading enzyme discovered to date,1 it by no means degrades plastic instantaneously.Below is the equation from the paper that enabled us to determine the extinction coefficient: Although this technically the coefficient for the denatured protein, the paper states explicitly that there is a "relatively small difference" between this coefficient and the coefficient of the native protein at 280 nm.However, we soon realized that the Michaelis-Menten model, with its references to substrate concentration, assumes that the substrate is in solution and would therefore be unsuitable for describing the kinetics associated with large solid substrates.An overview of Michaelis-Menten:3 The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) corresponds to the substrate concentration at which the speed of the reaction is half of the maximum possible velocity: Our team initially intended to compare the Michaelis-Menten constant associated with small plastics suspended in solutions to that of large pieces of plastics.It is valid at the beginning of reactions and is especially compatible with our reactor design considering that the products of the reaction are funneled to another chamber where none of the original substrate or enzyme are present.In future quantitative experiments involving PETase, it would be useful to have a means by which we could calculate the concentration of this enzyme in a given solution.In order to calculate the concentration of enzyme present, our team also needs to know PETase s extinction coefficient.The task required us to understand enzyme kinetics under two broad sets of circumstances: When the pieces of plastic were small enough in size so that they were effectively suspended in a solution.Another assumption is that the enzyme must be either free or bound to the substrate.Informing our Design: Modelling Michaelis-Menten KineticsAs we were refining the design of our plastic-sensing device, we were having a difficult time accounting for the lag between plastic uptake and plastic degradation.Prior to beginning our work, we ensured that the assumptions inherent in the model were reasonable for modelling PETase activity:2The model assumes that the product is not converted back into the substrate.The assumption also makes sense considering that our enzyme functions by breaking down polymers: after the reaction, the newly formed monomers no longer fit in the enzyme s active site.This would require us to apply models geared towards heterogeneous reactions that involve interactions between a solid substrate and an enzyme in solution.The extinction coefficient of an enzyme describes how much light the enzyme absorbs at a given wavelength.We realized that understanding degradation rates as determined by enzyme kinetics would allow us to adjust our reactor design to minimize the lag in signal.It states that it is reasonably accurate to calculate it "directly... from amino acid composition information".gamma_ES = 0*t; % surface coverage of enzyme-substrate complexgamma_total = gamma_S + gamma_ES + gamma_P; % total number of surface sitesd_gamma_S = diff(gamma_S)/h %

intention to use ocean plastic to produce a small amount of electricity, he provided technical advice concerning the types of materials that we should use in our fuel cell and stressed the importance of considering the economic viability of our cell.Attempted to print first model of 3D fuel cell.After allowing the bacteria to grow over 340 minutes, we observed that for both bacteria, the samples

'protocol': '', 'result': 'Further, this is evidence that the induction system we designed has strong control over PETase-sfGFP expression because we see almost no absorbance when the cultures were uninduced, and strong absorbance otherwise.In conclusion, this validates that PETase is catalytically active with our sfGFP fusion.tsuruhatensis Metabolizing Terephthalic Acid (TPA)Now that we have catalytic PETase and have optimized pH for our engineered E. coli, we want to be able to produce a signal in the presence of our PET degradation byproduct, terephthalic acid (TPA).Plastiback can be easy to use with a fluorescent \x93systems check\x94 and also break down PET.Now that we have the PETase enzyme working, we want to optimize the pH to have the most enzyme activity and fastest growth rate of E. coli.Because our recombinant PETase protein is the only his-tagged protein in the cell, we would expect to see a signal only from the band which contains PETase.This demonstrates that D. tsuruhatensis and the exogenous mediator are successfully working together in the microbial fuel to produce electricity from terephthalic acid, and that we are able to read out a signal from the presence of terephthalic acid.Unexpectedly, we also see a PETase-sized band in lanes 2,3, and 4, which should only have a band at 70 kD for the PETase-sfGFP fusion.In the visualization experiment, we can also test whether our inducible system is working because we would expect uninduced cells not to fluoresce, or at least fluoresce at a low basal level.They also confirm that we have inducible control over our construct because the uninduced sample shows basal expression.Delftia tsuruhatensis TPA utilizes TPA as the sole carbon sourceSelecting Exogenous Mediator Type and ConcentrationBefore we could test our MFC with D. tsuruhatensis and TPA, we had to determine which exogenous mediator would be optimal for our MFC.If you are wondering what the dark band below the PETase band is, it is lysozyme that we used in our cell lysis protocol.Constructed BioBricks for PETase and confirmed presence of protein using sfGFPConstructed BioBricks with secretion systems for PETaseValidated PETase expression through SDS Page and Western blotValidated PETase enzymatic activity through pNPB substrate assayCharacterized growth of three bacteria species in TPA minimal mediaDemonstrated TPA signal can be detected by voltage increase in microbial fuel cellAfter constructing our system, we needed to prove that it functions the way we designed it to.Although we confirmed the presence of our protein with sfGFP visualization, an SDS Page will further confirm by showing that a protein of the correct weight is being expressed.Not willing to sacrifice this ease-of-use feature, we set out to show that PETase-sfGFP could still be catalytically active.We adapted an assay used by the UC Davis 2012 Team that could characterize PETase\x92s esterase activity with a colorimetric readout.Additionally, we see a band at 70 kD in lanes 2 and 3, which is the expected size of PETase-sfGFP fusion.Yoshida et al (2016) A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate)As shown in the graph below, there is a big dropoff in growth between pH 8.5 and pH 9.0, therefore the happy medium between E. coli growth and PETase enzyme activity is around pH 8.5.In conclusion, this Western demonstrates that we have inducible control over PETase expression.After constructing our PETase-sfGFP fusion plasmids and demonstrating we had inducible control PETase expression via sfGFP visualization, SDS Page and Western Blot, we were ready to test whether the PETase-sfGFP construct catalytically active.At 30 kD, we see a band which corresponds to the approximate expected size of PETase (28.6 kD).After the voltage of D. tsuruhatensis in the presence of methylene blue and M9 plateaued, we injected terephthalic acid into the mix.From the original paper published on PETase1 we knew that the PETase could be catalytically active in our chassis organism E. coli, but we didn\x92t know whether the upgrades we made to the system would interfere with the catalytic activity.To show that any change in absorption was due to PETase-sfGFP fluorescence rather than other artifacts of the cell lysate, an uninduced control was run with pNPB substrate.Cells were induced with 0.4M, 0.1M, or 0M IPTG for either 6 hours or overnight, at either 15 or 30 degrees C. After expression, cells were then lysed according to our ultrasonication protocol, and supernatant and pellet were collected for the SDS Page gel.While the SDS page can show a protein of the proper size is being expressed, a Western allows us to probe the identity of protein itself.Before performing the SDS Page we grew up T7 lysY Iq cells containing a plasmid with PETase under control of the T7 promoter.Our final step in showing that we can produce an electrical signal from TPA was to demonstrate a voltage surge in an actual microbial fuel cell using D. tsuruhatensis, methylene blue, and terephthalic acid.To this end, we reached out to Parley for the Oceans, an organization dedicated to tackling threats to our oceans.The background is absorbance is likely due to the sfGFP fusion, which typically emits most strongly at a different wavelength but would also absorb some at 405nm.Lysozyme was run as a control, which you can see has a dark band in the same location.Below are our results:Induced PETase-sfGFP fusion is catalytically active.PETase fused to GFP is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate over time.Cells were lysed, and triplicates of induced culture lysate were mixed with pNPB substrate or the same lysis buffer they were already in.Without inducer, otherwise identical cell lysate has low absorbance as it is not expressing PETase or the GFP tag (brown).This experiment again demonstrates our system\x92s inducible control: the blue box shows there is no band in the absence of IPTG.Upon the addition of PNPB substrate, absorbance increases (pink trend) suggesting that PETase is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate.For the SDS Page protocol, please refer to our experiments page.Likewise, the substrate by itself has low absorbance (blue).Our results indicate that PETase-sfGFP has background absorbance without the pNPB substrate, but that with the pNPB substrate absorbance increases, showing that PETase-sfGFP is able to catalyze pNPB into 4-nitrophenol which will absorb at this wavelength.We put either methylene blue or neutral red into a plate reader with the E. Coli overnight to observe which condition would result in the largest reduction of methylene blue or neutral red.As shown in the graph below, D. tsuruhatensis with M9 (medium with no carbon source) didn\x92t grow as well as D. tsuruhatensis with M9 and TPA.To control for the background absorption of pNPB, just the substrate was also run.To make PETase easily detectable via Western Blot, we designed our constructs to include a \x93His tag\x94 which is targeted by a commercially available antibody.We hypothesize this is because the PETase GFP fusion is being degraded by proteases because it is so large.PETase has a weight of 24 kDa, so the band is exactly where we would expect to see PETase.After contacting Parley, we were redirected to their Junior Project Manager, Lisa Gran, who sent us 10g of \x93mixed raw plastic\x94 from the organization\x92s most recent beach cleanup.In the control that has not been induced (0M IPTG), we do not observe a band between 20 and 25 kDa.In our induced sample, we observed sfGFP fluorescence at a magnification of 100x.The image below shows that the best exogenous mediator type and concentration is methylene blue at 0.005.Delftia tsuruhatensis, Methylene Blue and TPA in Microbial Fuel Cell: Voltage over timeOur team achieved our objectives and successfully managed to demonstrate PETase enzymatic activity in a laboratory setting.Although you can still observe some baseline sfGFP fluorescence, the induced sample is much brighter and has many more cells fluorescing.It is also important that our inducible promoter is truly controlling protein expression and uninduced samples do not produce much PETase.The largest color change would indicate that the bacteria had efficiently reduced the exogenous mediator.We hypothesize the smear we see between 70 kD and 30kD in lane 2 is because of the same phenomenon, such that the PETase-GFP fusion is being chopped into varying length fragments, each which has a histag and therefore shows up on the blot.Future directions of our project would include characterizing degradation of the acquired mixed plastic to simulate a real-world situation and work towards optimizing our system.1Yoshida, Shosuke et al.In the future, our team envisions our enzyme degrading plastic collected directly from the ocean.This band is strongest in lane 1, which contains lysate from our PETase construct that is unfused to GFP and induced with IPTG.By simply shining a UV light on the cell culture, an ocean plastic researcher without synthetic biology experience can determine whether Plastiback is working or not based simply on fluorescence.For a more detailed description, please refer to the project experiments page.D.In particular, the sfGFP fusion we made to allow Plastiback to be easily serviced by ocean researchers might interfere with the enzyme\x92s active site, for example.On the right is the uninduced sample, also at 100x.The assay, called the p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) substrate assay, demonstrates enzyme activity when the breaking of an ester bond in the substrate produces 4-Nitrophenol.The sfGFP tag produces some absorbance reading which is why the green trend line is not closer to zero.In order to produce an electrical signal from TPA in our MFC, we have to first demonstrate that our bacteria can metabolize TPA.Finally, we see no signal in lane 5, which was lysate from cells containing the same construct as lane 1, but uninduced.Because we wanted to test with a bacteria known to work with exogenous mediators, we ran this preliminary test with E. Coli.By running an SDS-PAGE as described above, we could separate all the proteins in the cell by size.Showing our protein is inducibly expressed: SDS Page and Western blotNext, we can validate protein expression further with SDS Page and Western blot visualization.Our graph below shows that after adding terephthalic acid, the voltage spikes from just below 90mV to around 120mV.The individual specks in the following photo on the left are cells.', 'safety': 'What opinions do these people have about your project?Our product is intended to be used as a plastic-mapping and plastic-degrading device for ocean researchers and others concerned with the distribution of plastic in the ocean.Future directions of our project are mechanical design solutions to the following important questions: How do we prevent small animals from getting trapped in the device?Will the device stay afloat and be easy to retrieve from the ocean?What happens when it s all used up?On a farm, in a factory, inside human bodies, in the ocean?Because our prototype is meant to be used in the ocean, we envision a bioreactor design that ensures the engineered microbes act as a closed system that is not released into the ocean environment.Lastly, because the Delftia bacteria in the microbial fuel cell is not genetically modified, its escape does not pose a significant risk.If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?Direct benefits of a successful and efficient plastic-sensing system, such as Plastiback, will be felt by researchers looking to map the distribution of plastics in the ocean, who have no alternative to physical sampling.At our current stage of research, we have determined that PETase production exerts a significant metabolic load on our expression cells, making them unlikely to be able to survive in the ocean environment.The influx of plastic will make that difficult, but future directions for research will include solidifying design to prevent engineered microbes from escaping into the ocean environment.Because the ocean surrounds us and touches each of our lives every day, this application will benefit the global community.As part of the prototype stage of our design, we are considering the environmental impact of the product in the oceans.Plastiback also has the added benefit of being able to collect plastic and degrade it, converting these fragments, especially microplastics which otherwise pollute the ocean and interfere with the lifecycles of marine organisms, into electricity.To prevent our engineered microbes from being released into the environment, we followed our host lab\x92s guidelines for proper disposal of organic waste.Parley for the Oceans also sent us a typical sample of ocean plastic.Estimates of plastic in the ocean are currently derived from surveys by research crews hauling nets through the ocean and hand-counting pieces of plastic3.This included appropriate clothing, covered shoes, lab coats, goggles, and disposable gloves.When choosing bacteria to use in our microbial fuel cell for their special ability to degrade Terephthalic Acid(TPA), a by-product of PET plastic degradation, we were careful to select only BSL1 organisms.\x93Bottles, Bags, Ropes and Toothbrushes: The Struggle to Track Ocean Plastics.\x94 Nature 536.7616 (2016): 263\x96265.When working with such chemicals, we were careful to only work under the fume hood.This being said, our future work includes testing bioengineered control mechanisms such as a kill switch or synthetic amino-acid dependency 2 to make the risk of escape and proliferation in the environment even smaller.Considering the implications of synthetic biology tools to the world beyond the lab, It is important to maintain safe and ethical use of engineered organisms.We transported materials between our lab and the Northeastern team\x92s lab in sealed containment to prevent release.To prevent exposure, we wore basic personal protective equipment in the lab at all times.Plastiback\x92s contribution to ocean plastic research will affect how well the effects of plastic pollution are neutralized.Plastiback, as

problems (such as the expected doubling of waste entering NZ\x92s landfills within ten years), the NZ councils have enacted a zero-waste policy; to progressively achieve zero-waste status by 2040.Our team\x92s aim was to aid this policy (as well as the global plastic plague) by producing a strain of E. coli that produces enzymes which degrade PET.The bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis uses two enzymes to break PET down into Terephthatlic Acid (TPA) and Ethylene Glycol (EG): PETase and MHETase respectively (Yoshida et al., 2016).An initial introductory skype session allowed us to meet, give one another a run down on our respective projects, and to figure out how we might be able to assist each other.We found that the best way the UoA iGEM team could help the Sydney team would be to liaise with large New Zealand horticulture companies on their behalf.Members of iGEM UoA were also able to fill out a survey provided by the iGEM Sydney, and distribute this survey to other people in order to assist them in their data collection.To help us at iGEM UoA, the team at the University of Sydney provided their laboratory protocols for His-Tag purification and IPTG Induction.The NTCU Formosa team kindly presented their work to us, as well as sharing details of their past iGEM projects and meet-ups, to give us more of an idea how the iGEM competition works.Doi: 10.1126/science.aad6359As a student-led start-up team we decided to approach the Taiwanese teams NTCU and NYMU, who had gone through multiple rounds of iGEM competitions in the past years, to receive some tips and tricks of the competition process and team system development.Both teams in Taiwan are working on pesticides that are targeted to a specific agricultural epidemic that has caused great loss in Taiwanese farmlands.This is discovery will assist with both teams sustainability in iGEM competition in the future to come.In true ANZAC spirit, iGEM UoA collaborated with the iGEM team from the University of Sydney.This was done, and a relationship was established with Turner\x92s and Grower\x92s NZ who were able to provide the team from Sydney with valuable information regarding the influence of fruit ripening on the produce storage and transportation industry.We exchanged with them our experience as a start-up team on what challenge we faced just to get the team together as we are all interested to know what would be the different kind of administrative barriers from a team that have a developed system and a newly set-up.The team leaders showed us around their lab area and kindly shared their detailed and well planned perspective on their human practice project which most definitely broaden our horizon as a start-up team on how extensively an iGEM can affect and influence the community.The first, a functional domain, has the ability to cleave polyethylene terephthalanie, the main plastic used in bottles world-wide, into a monomer ethylene terephthalate.Plastic is lightweight and has space-filling properties, which allow it to fill 20% of NZ\x92s landfill space (252,000 tonnes per year), with difficult to degrade plastics such as PET contributing to up to 15% of this.In 2015, 56 million tonnes of plastic was produced worldwide; although some of this is recycled or the energy from the plastic is utilized, much of it enters landfills.Given time, effort, and perhaps a little luck, we could purify and find the 3D structure of these PET degrading enzymes, which would allow us to characterise them, and potentially refine and improve the mechanism of PET degradation for commercial use.Our part encodes for a protein derived from Idonella sakaiensis first discovered by Yoshida et al.It is here that we took inspiration for our project; to create biobricks for PETase and MHETase that, when inserted into an E. coli vector, could produce viable, purifiable proteins, that are secreted from the cell, or can be obtained through lysing the E. coli..These teams emphasised raising awareness for the implementation of safe biotechnology into daily use, to elevate the quality of human lives , and the environment.They elaborated on their human practise projects, which included working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture in Taiwan, and showed their dedication on making the agriculture sector a more biotech/engineering- friendly place.We concluded that the main difference would be the focus that shifted from the system development of the sub-teams and relationship building with the University to inter-team communication and interaction within team members.The third and final domain is a polyhistadine domain allowing for easy purification of the protein by affinity chromatography.This part was expressed using the T7 promoter (part BBa_1719005) under the control of the lac operator sequence (unpublished).Yoshida S et al.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'We were able to create an effective dialogue with students, with some even asking if a course on synthetic biology was offered at our university \x96 the teachers even politely requested that we attend again to present to the rest of the student body!We went to 3 different high schools all over Auckland.The third school, Aorere College, was visited on September the 21st where we spoke to a class of science students in their last year of secondary studies.The presentation outlined the negative impacts of plastic as well as the flaws in the recycling initiative and how our project would help minimize these.We then conversed about our iGEM project in an open forum-like manner, with students raising some very intriguing questions!Our presentations enabled us to approach a diverse population and to deliver insight into the uncommonly-known field of synthetic biology and the possibilities it holds.The presentation also included encouraging students with the problem \x93How would you decrease plastic waste using synthetic biology?\x94 and were very interactive during the presentation with lots of queries.We hoped that by approaching secondary-level students, a similar outcome can be produced in terms of synthetic biology and the future use of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs).We presented our project at four different high schools located within the larger Auckland region.On September 6th we went to ACG college in central Auckland to present to the year 13 biology students.This was a real eye opener.\x94 Sam Lomo- Student at Aorere CollegeIn New Zealand, synthetic biology and the iGEM programme are both relatively unheard of with the latter also being very new.On September 16th we went to St Dominic\x92s College in west Auckland where we spoke to a group of passionate young biology students.It was amazing talking to all of the students and we highly appreciated there passion and thinking.\x93It was a wonderful and engaging presentation.Furthermore, interactive-based activities were held to introduce synthetic biology, to discuss the positive and negative implications, and to clarify any misconceptions about both the field and the use of GMOs.Coupled with this, we hope that more New Zealand teams are prompted to participate in future competitions and to promote the synthetic biology field even further.The students all had positive responses to the presentation.Public education programs functioning to promote and educate high school and primary school students about the importance of recycling have been considerably effective in waste management.During these talks, we informed students about the challenges currently

Different stationary phase temperature: by reducing the temperature we might be able to reduce growth and obtain more Curdlan  Yeast cell walls are naturally made up of various layers which are represented in the following diagram.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 68: 163\x96173  [2] R. Zhang and K. J.

defenses.Plos one 93:525\x96531 To sum it up, we would like to produce Curdlan in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then sulfate it before spraying it on grapevine leaves as a preventive treatment against Downy mildew infections.Therefore, the only alkali soluble components are a mix of (1?6)-?-glucans(1?3)-?-D-glucans.We therefore decided to over-express the Curdlan metabolic pathway by inserting into yeast (INVSC1 strain ) an inducible promoter (Gal1) for the ?-glucan synthase gene (Fks1) hoping that this would allow the cell to produce Curdlan in greater quantities.Annu Rev Immunol 20:197\x96216 [13] Jagodzinski PP, Wiaderkiewicz R (1994) Mechanism of the inhibitory effect of curdlan sulphate on HIV-1 infection in vitro.We rapidly eliminated Bacillus subtilis from our possible hosts due to its lack of enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of (1?3)-?-glucans (Figure 5).In addition, curdlan gels have medical and pharmacological potential, for example in drug delivery through sustained and diffusion-controlled release of the active ingredient.The protective effects for the bacteria are due to the fact that Curdlan forms a capsule that completely surrounds the outer cell surface of bacteria.(aimanianda et al 2009) In order to separate the two compounds, we plan on using (1?6)-?-glucanases in order to obtain a solution of (1?3)-?-glucans and therefore our Curdlan molecule.All the other Curdlan clinical applications in cancer, diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia etc.»  « Because, as we explained on the problem page, Downy Mildew is a real problem for the Aquitaine region.This is demonstrated by the study of a double mutant of pmr4 which restore the susceptibility to mildew.Glucan molecules are polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers linked by glycosidic bonds and one of them is called Curdlan , a (1?3)-?-D-glucan.Also, activation of a Pathogenesis-Related protein called PR1 in grapevine is regulated by the salicylic acid signaling pathway .[16] To conclude, activation of natural defenses before the invasion of pathogens is a way to improve the plant resistance against infection and to reduce the use of chemicals products.Figure 2: Schematic representation of the (1?3)-?-glucan synthetic pathway [2]  Before starting the project, we took a few weeks to decide which host organism we would use and how they could be useful.We planned on amplifying our fragments by PCR and creating different biobricks with different assemblies of our genes and plasmids in order to find the effect of each gene on Curdlan production and to verify the efficiency of our promoter.The safety of Curdlan has been assessed in animal studies and in vitro tests [4,5] and it is approved for food use in Korea, Taiwan and Japan as an inert dietary fibre.Furthermore, non-sulfated Curdlan doesn t trigger the response through a mutant gene: pmr4.[10] Furthermore, Curdlan derivatives are members of a class of compounds known as biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses.This is the medium which is used for Curdlan production in Agrobacterium and is also interesting since it is a minimal medium which allows us to easily vary parameters and optimize production.Gal1 promoter and HIS3 was extract by PCR from pFA 6a-HIS3MX6-pGAL-3HA .On the other hand, we will integrate the FKS1 gene into the iGEM plasmid pSB1C3 to get our BioBrick that we ll send to Boston.However, we found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae naturally produces Curdlan in its cell wall, like Agrobacterium.This is not the case with E. coli in our project.First, we decided to produce Curdlan with Escherichia coli , because Agrobacterium tumefasciens because both of them are Gram negative bacteria and have a lot of membrane similarity.We therefore inserted the three genes which code for the ?-glucan synthase and metabolic transporters in Agrobacterium (crdASC) into E. coli .In: WHO (ed) 53rd Meeting of the joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives.For example, it can have antitumor, anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities (see other properties of Curdlan).Commonly, the yeast cell wall is made of 5-10% of (1?6)-?-glucans and 50-55% of a mix of (1?3)-?-glucans and (1?3)-?-glucans.So, sulfation of the glucan would counteract the negative feedback effect.In Agrobacterium , three genes (crdA, crdS and crdC) are required for Curdlan production.However, more research is needed for the further development of these useful properties, in particular by reducing the cost of production.CRC, Boca Raton, pp 269\x96286 [5] Spicer EJF, Goldenthal EI, Ikeda T (1999) A toxicological assessment of curdlan.In order to have control

McIntosh (2005) Curdlan and other bacterial (1?3)-?-D-glucans mini review.The capsule formation is correlated with cell aggregation (floc formation) and it is suggested that the capsule and floc formation together function as protective structures in cases of Nitrogen-starvation of the post-stationary phase.We then tried to put a inductive promoter ahead of the relevant gene by homologous recombination.[1]  [1] M. McIntosh (2005) Curdlan and other bacterial (1?3)-?-D-glucans mini review.Indeed, Curdlan production in Agrobacterium requires Nitrogen Starvation and its growth parameters need to be relatively precise.All three genes were synthesized by IDT separately with the correct ends to allow integration in the iGEM plasmids and an easy creation of our biobricks.Since the layer of mannan and proteins as well as chitin is insoluble in alkali solutions, beta glucans are easily separated from the rest of the yeast cell wall.Trends Glycosci Glycotechnol 4:309\x96317 [10] Kanke M, Tanabe E,(1995) Application of curdlan to controlled drug delivery.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 93:525\x96531  [3] Adrien Gauthier (2014)The Sulfated Laminarin Triggers a Stress Transcriptome before Priming the SA- and ROS-Dependent Defenses during Grapevine\x92s Induced Resistance against Plasmopara viticola.However, site-directed mutagenesis may be necessary when integrating the gene into the plasmid because there are restriction sites (EcoR1) that are unwanted within the HIS3 gene.The results indicate that the chemical modification of an elicitor, such as sulfated derivative of ß-glucans, could improve its resistance-inducer efficiency.However, since our gene sequences for crdA, crdS, and crdC originally come from Agrobacterium we decided to optimize our gene codons for E. coli with IDT codon optimization tool in order to make sure that our gene would correctly be expressed.konjac glucomannan, methylcellulose), the heating process alone produces different forms of curdlan gels with different textural qualities, physical stabilities and water-holding capacities.Manipulation of the conditions for self-assembly may allow the engineering of new materials.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': 'In our Notebook we provide a summary of our labwork and an overview over the used protocols.', 'protocol': '', 'result': 'The primers used for PCR have floating tails allowing the integration of the cassette upstream FKS1 gene.Thanks to Derek Mc Cluster we tried to overexpress FKS1 gene by integrating GAL1 inducible promoter upstream of it by the homologous recombination method.The amplification product containing the selection gene and the promoter flanked by the homologous recombination of sequences is purified.For that, we designed PCR primers that flank the gene of interest taking into account the issues of specific primers to the target sequences, self-aliasing or primer annealing there between.To insert FKS1 gene into the chosen plasmid, it was necessary to amplify this gene by PCR on yeast genomic DNA.One of the first strategies to overexpress the FKS1 gene encoding a D-glucan synthase was to insert it into a plasmid compatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We designed a pair of primers specifically hybridizing upstream of the gene of interest and framing the location where construction must integrate.? A plasmid used was pFA 6a-HIS3MX6-pGAL-3HA plasmid because there is a gene cassette located into containing GAL1 promoter and HIS3 selection gene.?

test the toxicity of this molecule on the bacteria that already live in nature.For the Environment Even if copper is essential for life at low doses, it is environmentally toxic at higher doses.Also, the copper-related risks are increased if added residues of this product from agricultural cultures, other food sources containing copper as tap water.This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer s disease.This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer s disease.For Humans Through the food chain, copper is an essential element for life at low doses.Indeed, when it is accumulated in the body in large quantities, it is supposed to affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain.If we want to directly use our synthetic organism on the plant, we must integrate death genes in their genomes to create organisms that are not be able to live in natural conditions.In our project, the cell can\x92t evolve and in any manner alter the environment.After different doses were tested, an encouraging result emerged : the weekly fructose application of 100 g / ha had a similar effect than a treatment of 600 g / ha of copper.Indeed, when it accumulates in the body, it is in too large quantities, it would affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain.In 2013, the \x93Savoy ADAbio\x94 tested on vine plants the effect of very low doses of different sugars in order to replace the copper treatment in the fight against pests.This element has been used many times to treat mildew which has resulted in it\x92s accumulation in the Aquitaine region.In the case of our project, we are not planning on directly applying our genetically engineered bacteria on the plant but only our purified molecule.The measure reduces the damage to the biosphere but isn\x92t sufficient: copper sulfate is tolerated but not banished.This molecule already exists in nature, it is naturally present in the yeast\x92s wall.Compared to copper sulfate which is a toxic compound, this molecule seems to be more environmentally friendly.In other words, we chose to spray on the vine only the cell product: Curdlan.We are not using the entire cell Another important theme is the spread of new organisms in nature.However, it is harmful if swallowed or inhaled, in cases of skin contact, eye contact (hence the compulsory wearing of gloves masks and glasses during our project) and is very toxic to aquatic organisms.In the lab, there is a specific solvent cabinet for liquid wastes.No bad impact on the environment has been identified.For now, we are still waiting for the results.The team who worked in the lab received instructions of lab safety with safety training.Most products used are classified as non-hazardous (even for the sulfation protocol).It accumulates on the soils and vineyards are polluted.It disrupts, for example, the development of mycorrhiza fungi that live in symbiosis with the

these terms.Since we worked with non-toxic organisms as Escherichia coli (BL21) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Invsc1), all waste that has been in contact with bacteria was put to bacterial waste in aseptic conditions but no specific security procedures needed to be put in place.This compound also modifies the biosphere since it is toxic for worms and microorganisms living in vineyard soils.We learned how to act in the case of an accident, where to find emergency showers, fire extinguishers and emergency doors.Not dangerous for Humans Our project aims to use a polysaccharide which is synthetically produced by our genetically modified organisms.It is also increasingly referred to as an "environmental illness".In humans, it is known that copper occurs naturally and in normal

factors, which activate genes involved in the oxidative stress response (He and Fassler, 2005).Consequently, when encountering microcystin, our yeast will start to produce yellow fluorescent protein, and the resulting fluorescence can then be measured.Check out our introduction video \x93Matti and the cyanobacteria\x94 to see how our solution for this problem would work!Normal yeast lab strains

right in the beginning of our project just to hear from different experts what they consider to be synthetic biology, what they thought of our various ideas and how they would proceed with the project.Addressing a local problem creates an affinity between our project and the public, and also makes it easier for us to promote synthetic biology to them.We wanted to see what kind of need there was for informing the general public about all the possibilities synthetic biology offers, as well as, from our project\x92s point of view, the need to inform about the dangers of cyanobacteria.These experts gave us much appreciated information and new perspectives to our ideas When our team started brainstorming for the project idea, our general knowledge of what would be feasible and what wouldn\x92t was quite insufficient.They have also helped us during the course of our project - for example the degradation part of our project would not have ended up being what it is without their help.The University of Helsinki\x92s Faculty of Science wrote an article about our project and especially what the two mathematicians of our team had learned from this synthetic biology project.They guided us to the Finnish Environment Institute (Suomen ympäristökeskus, SYKE), where we got to discuss the cyanobacteria problem and our project with experts.In the beginning, we didn\x92t really understand how scary and strange a branch synthetic biology seems to be for people not involved in it, but during the project we started to understand this.When we met with companies, there was also a lot of discussion of the potential commercialization of our project, which meant patenting our idea.We didn\x92t change much in our project topic itself based on the interviews but we increased the importance of talking to the public.Although neither the topic of our project nor the nature of iGEM made patenting seem like a relevant concern, we nevertheless thought it would be useful to gain an understanding of this aspect.After that we were able to also think about the modelling part of our project and how it could support the experimental parts of our work.We have written about the meetups on the We have created a website in addition to the Wiki which includes team descriptions, as well as a brief introduction to our project and partners.Our detection device would contain live yeast cells to produce the fluorescence signal, and is the main concern of our project when thinking about accidental release of GMOs.One result of our efforts to communicate with the non-scientific community was our project introduction video \x93Matti and the cyanobacteria\x94, found on our We participated in two iGEM meetups, the ones in Stockholm and Paris, which gave us many things to consider in our project.As a part of the recruiting the next year\x92s team, we will present our project in a few different events, such as the Water Day of the Aalto Unviersity School of Engineering, where different projects related to the water industry are presented, and the Career Day of Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences of the University of Helsinki.We also talked about the possibility to use genetically modified yeast as a sensor in the natural environment and it was nice to hear that they didn\x92t turn this idea down even if it is not allowed by the Finnish legislation at the moment.how to explain that cyanobacteria are a problem for people who don\x92t live in Finland and don t have the same problems with it as we do.We talked with ThermoFisher, Algol and LAL (Luonnontieteiden akateemisten liitto), and they showed great interest in our project, even helping us with the funding.Keeping this in mind and inspired by the Finnish nature and lifestyle, we decided to approach the problem of blue-green algae in the context of sauna water, thus limiting the scope of our products to a few drops of water and to maximum one bucket of water (~20 L) for the detection and degradation, respectively.That\x92s why meeting Merja Oja, who works with modeling biological systems, was very important in the beginning of our project.Still, as each of the interviewed people had encountered blue-green algae, it means that our project can touch their lives and possibly to facilitate their life in the future.We will be presenting our project results and achievements from the Jamboree to some of our sponsors, as well as school representatives.They gave us valuable input on our thoughts of harnessing the yeast stress response Finnish legislation towards genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is strict, similar to the rest of the European Union.As the information has had a significant effect on the design of our project, it will be presented more deeply in integrated human practices section.Some of the most important modifications we did in our presentations to people with limited biological background was dismissing almost all scientific terms, assuming no background information, focusing on what we can achieve with our project instead of the exact methodology, and leaving more time for questions.The most valuable information from our meeting with SYKE, the Finnish Environment Institute, was that we learned what kind of solutions already exist for the blue green algae problem.Even though our team had students from fields ranging from biotechnology to mathematics, there wasn\x92t anyone who really understood both fields well enough to have a clear idea of what modelling is like in the field synthetic biology.As we didn\x92t have much experience on protein production in yeast and as it was in a focal role in our project, we needed some help in planning our enzyme constructs.Putting a lot of thought into justifications for our choices at this point of our project turned out to be very useful, since after that, we didn\x92t have to regret that we should have done something in a completely different way.In Stockholm, the SDU team couldn\x92t present their full project because they were in the process of patenting it.They also discussed with us the business aspects of our project and gave us good advice on how to build our business strategy if we are to bring our algae detection and degradation methods to masses.Later in the project, we had a meeting with Algol, one of sponsors, where we presented our results.When we had decided on the top three project ideas, we met with researchers working with these different subjects as a part of the background research we did about the different options.We told them about our project, discussed synthetic biology and the use of biotechnology in Finland.This would also let our project be more approachable and understandable to the the public as well as sponsors.If the Cyanobacteria group and professor Frey along with his group affected the degradation aspect of our project the most, Jussi Jäntti and his research group from VTT likely contributed the most to the detection part.Especially talking with our primary PI Markus Linder directed our brainstorming and ideation, which finally led up to the final design of the project.From interviewing people in the streets, we learned that public knowledge about synthetic biology was rather restricted.In addition, as the synthetic amino acid couldn\x92t be scavenged from the environment, the GMOs would survive only as long as they are externally supplemented by the amino acids.Besides gaining information about the need of synthetic biology outreach, we wanted to see what people know about blue green algae and if it has caused problems for them.Thanks to input from Kaarina Sivonen and her group, the decision about our project subject was finalized.Our team gave them a presentation about our project and synthetic biology.Also, Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering posted an article about our project, iGEM, and synthetic biology.Each of our team members has also presented themselves, so if you want to get to know our team a bit better, check out the blog: Even though Wiki Freeze and the Giant Jamboree are here, we have still some human practices left after all this.With our project, we hope to improve the understanding about synthetic biology and GMOs.If the use of GMOs was legal, our yeast based detection system could provide an easy and affordable solution.Additionally, as we learned how restricted the knowledge about our topic is, we have been able to adjust our presentations better for the targeted audiences.We have given much consideration to the ethical implications of our work.As we had also gotten sponsorships from certain companies they posted about us and our project on their web pages which was nice.In addition, LAL will publish an article in their member magazine about our iGEM experience after the Jamboree.In both meetups, we were presented with the idea of patenting one\x92s work.It was great to see that so many people were interested in our project as well as modelling in synthetic biology.Many of these experts gave us much appreciated information and new aspects to our ideas that have guided our project towards what it is today.He also questioned our choice to use yeast at all in the enzyme production, and made us broaden our thinking and justify our ideas.They guided us to plan our detection device so that it would correspond to the current need - being available for the public and not be too expensive.This convinced us that we were on right track with the degradation.Our project was on display in the media.In Paris, we participated in a panel discussion where part of the discussion was about patents and the openly communicated nature of iGEM projects.The team\x92s acceptance of the idea was driven by how popular the problem was in Finland.In addition to Luma we gave a talk on \x93Mathematical Modelling in Synthetic Biology\x94 for math students at the University of Helsinki.Hopefully we were able to inspire them to continue with the study of biology in the future and perhaps even try themselves in the field of synthetic biology.In addition, to adopt a biological containment strategy, we would engineer several essential proteins in our yeast cells to have a dependency on non-standard amino acids for their proper translation, folding and function, as described by Mandell et al.This was supposed to be part of our project, but unfortunately time constraints prevented us from doing this.We want to stir up the conversation about GMO legislation, and be part of the discussion about how GMOs could be used outside of the lab and by general public.After giving them a \x93Biology 101\x94 lecture, they got to hear how modelling was done in our project.The article was later posted also on the university\x92s main news page.It seemed that the general conception of synthetic biology was something quite foreign and that there is a need for raising awareness of the hazards of cyanobacteria.However, as our plan would be to use the capsules for small quantities of water (bucket-scale), releasing this capsule in just one bucket of water alleviates such concerns; as the enzymes are scaled for such a small quantity, they would be extremely diluted when released to the open environment.All of the interviewed people were familiar with it but didn\x92t know much about the health or economic problems it causes.We consider them a part of our human practices since we got a lot of input from them for our project, and got to talk about our ideas with other iGEMers.It is necessary to properly design the kit so that the yeast cells are contained within the device, in addition to placing biosafety measures for the possibility that the GMOs would escape the device, either caused by the device breaking or because of product misuse.The kind of synthetic auxotrophy described by Mandell can be considered a more advanced and secure method of biocontainment, and in particular if combined with still other containment strategies, it would make it highly unlikely that our yeast could bypass the biocontainment.We have also been or will be a part of our sponsors\x92 blogs.We also discussed current detection methods and according to them, all the available detection methods are rather expensive and hardly any of them is available for the public.We hope that this has helped people follow our work better and in a way bring them closer to our research and what it is like to be a part of an iGEM team.The precautionary principle is a concept used in risk management and according to it, if an action is suspected to be harmful for the public or the environment and there is no scientific agreement on the matter, then the burden of proof that it is not harmful lies on the party which is carrying out the suspected action.This gave us additional courage to choose our GMO yeast sensor as our project idea.As multiple genes would be dependent on the synthetic amino acids, escaping biocontainment via mutagenesis would require mutations in a large number of genes.In order to gain more insight into the problem of cyanobacteria in Finland, we contacted the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.Even though many experts gave us advice and guided our brainstorming, deciding about the topic and more precise plans were left for ourselves.We met with high school students who were candidates for the Finnish team of the International Biology Olympiad.to spread the word of iGEM as well as tell people about our project and about ourselves.They described the full extent of algae detection problem in Finland and all the strategies used in the past and at the moment to deal with it both in research and industry.They found our approach interesting and promising since they have been trying to deal with the blue-green algae problem for many years now.It was discussed that communication really is the key when trying to create business in this field, and that researchers should learn how to communicate about this seemingly outlandish field to the general public.It was also nice to hear that there was no available method for the present day to get rid of the cyanobacteria or the toxins.We talked with experts from different universities and research centers in the fields of biology, genetic engineering, biological modeling and cyanobacterial research.In large part, negative attitudes towards GMOs can stem from connotations of certain words, as well as the perception of strangeness in the daily lives of people.The Gene Technology Act is based on the EU Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC, which concern the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment and the contained used of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), respectively.In high concentrations, lysozyme could also have drastic effects on the ecosystem, as it can can lyse the cell walls of many bacteria.As discussed above, our conclusion was that it didn\x92t seem relevant to our project.Without them we probably wouldn\x92t have thought to use flow cytometry, which ended up providing important support and verification for our other results!We also got good practise on how to communicate with people who don\x92t have much background in biology, not to mention synthetic biology.This would allow detection of microcystin in the water while ensuring that the yeast stays inside the device.Algol has posted a few posts about our journey in iGEM on their blog, and want to also publish something once we return from Boston.We wanted our products to have minimal side-effects on the environment and that meant limiting the reach of any genetically modified organism present in those products.The broadcast of the episode can be listened here: http://areena.yle.fi/1-3424583 (in Finnish).Their input greatly affected our choice of using modified yeast as the detection chassis organism.Our degradation enzyme capsule, on the other hand, would not contain any living cells - only commercial lysozyme and enzymes derived from the genetically modified microorganisms.TEK magazine, the magazine of Tekniikan akateemiset, an organization for Academics of Technology, published an article about us as well.We found about the Cyanobacteria research group of the University of Helsinki and met with them.They also gave us input on our results and gave ideas on possibilities to take things further, e.g.(Geenitekniikan lautakunta) As it is impossible to predict the cascade of consequences resulting from GMOs being released into the environment, caution in this respect is well-advised.The enzyme has a specificity for the Adda-arginine bond, which is only present in cyanotoxins.This would have to be done in an especially fool-proof manner if the kit was to be commercialized.We reasoned that by working with baker\x92s yeast (common name for Saccharomyces cerevisiae), an organism familiar to most people with neutral if not positive connotations, our work would feel more approachable to and less detached from people\x92s everyday lives.In addition, the genetic material of decomposed GMOs could be taken up by other organisms, leading to even more possibilities for unwanted consequences.In Finland, the Gene Technology Act regulates the use of GMOs and promotes the safe use and development of gene technology along with ethical practices and consideration of the precautionary principle (Geenitekniikan lautakunta).This gave us a lot to think, since our project\x92s final product was designed to be a genetically engineered organism used outside the lab.Based on this, we really thought that there was a need to increase knowledge about synthetic biology.It also contains a description of synthetic biology, a safety conscious statement, and an explanation of what iGEM is.', 'modeling': 'To this end, we have chosen three naturally occurring promoters from genes involved in the yeast\x92s oxidative stress response: CTT1, CPP1 and TSA1.As part of our project, we are designing a novel detection mechanism for the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin using live yeast cells.In our concept for the detection mechanism, a sample of water, either contaminated with microcystin or not, is supplemented to a culture of live yeast cells.As an Oxidative Stress Response mechanism, Yap1p is localized and accumulated in the nucleus.Meanwhile, the other two promoters have binding sites for Yap1p and for a third transcription factor Skn7p.The essential principle is to couple the yeast\x92s natural response against the toxin to the production of a yellow ?uorescent protein, Venus.To study our detection mechanism mathematically, we have created a model for the transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7 and their activation in the cells, hoping to determine production patterns and thresholds of YFP and provide suggestions for optimal promoter design for future iterations of the project.CTT1 has a single binding site for a transcription factor known as YAP1 and at least one binding site for the factor MSN2.The detection mechanism then functions as follows: the genetically modi?ed yeast take the toxin in through a specific transporter (QDR2 from strain VL3), after which the toxin inhibits the function of protein phosphatases in the cell.The cell naturally ?ghts against this accumulation of harmful oxygen species through a mechanism known as Oxidative Stress Response, or OSR.', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'microcystin

Coli and sufficient for leupeptin production.LeupA has a predicted product similar in weight to the predicted 260 kDa for leupeptin synthase.Finally, natural leupeptin producers degrade leupeptin in the stationary phase, meaning we could see much higher yields with heterologous expression.We obtained three S. roseus strains and attempted to amplify leupA and leupB from the genome using primers to add the entire RFC[10] prefix and suffix, designed using the unassembled genome sequence of strain ATCC 31245.Both ocimene itself and E. coli with our pathway would be tested by the Crow Lab at Georgia State University for inhibition of P. destructans.Unfortunately, we were unable to assemble these plasmids for submission to the parts registry.Antifungals could kill fungi which compete with P. destructans on the bats\x92 skin, or disrupt cave function.We instead began our plan for defending bats from White Nose Syndrome with the volatile compound ocimene.Additionally, the single ocimene synthase gblock was designed for direct RFC[10] digestion and ligation, with flanking VF2 and VR sites for amplification using existing primers.Leupeptin acid reductase was noted to always elute with leupeptin acid synthetase, and had an estimated weight of 320 kDa, almost identical to the combined weights of LeupA and B.Unfortunately, the biosynthesis of most protease inhibitors remains a mystery, but a recent preprint purports to have found a gene cluster in Streptomyces roseus responsible for the synthesis of leupeptin, commonly used in protease inhibitor cocktails (and expensive).Analysis of the P. destructans secretome found a serine endopeptidase, destructin-1, responsible for much of the fungus  ability to degrade collagen in bats\x92 skin.The domains of leupA and B have homology to proteins with condensation actions similar to those proposed for the synthesis of leupeptin, including arginine and leucine.Our issue was exacerbated when no PCR primers were ordered for the amplification of individual gblocks, and stocks eventually ran out.These pathways were constructed from the codon-optimized genes of Enterococcus faecalis, Methanosarcina mazei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli, with one designed for optimum flux and the other providing extensibility for synthesis of other terpenes.PCR did not appear to amplify the desired products under a variety of conditions, with the long additions making the primers too long for use with the template, which has a GC content of over 70%.Bats with the fungus that survive until arousal in the spring have demonstrated an ability to recover from the disease.Finally, the codon-optimized ocimene synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana would be assembled in an additional plasmid to catalyze the final step of ocimene synthesis.We ruled out most candidates for leucine acetyltransferase that could have been included in the 70 kbp vector with BLAST results to known genes except for a 18.84 kDa hypothetical protein, which differs significantly from the 27 kDa observed previously and occurs upstream rather than downstream as Barona-Gómez suggested two additional genes may be.By 2012, the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimated at least 6 million bats had already succumbed to the disease, while state and federal agencies have scrambled to close off caves and protect unaffected bat populations.Additionally, damage to the thin wing membranes hinders flight while inducing a variety of physiological changes and inflammation.For an interactive map of the spread of White-Nose

little succes cloning Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 s outer membrane porins involved in phosphate and polyphosphate uptake (OprP and OprO).The aim of the phosphate assay was to create a reliable method of determining the concentration of phosphate both inside of the cell and within the cell growth media.This assay showed concentrations similar to those calculated in the previous assay; however an observation was that as the volume of acid added increases, apart from peak at lower formic acid amounts, the concentration of phosphate recorded decreases.Figure 10 shows the amount of phosphate up taken from the media standardised using cell count (1.0 OD600 - 8x108 cells).Our hypothesis was that if the assay did not detect polyphosphate, we would have seen a significant decrease in the levels of phosphate detected when the glassmilk was used.From the results shown above in figure 8, we compared the amount of phosphate in the media of each sample.Graph showing the phosphate concentration

decided to join forces with the growth assay team to analyse the phosphate concentration in the growth media of ?pstA, ?pstC, ?pstB, ?pstS, ?phoE, ?ppk, ?ppx and BW25113 using our phosphate assay kit.From these results, we proceeded to run a second assay using two strains of ?ppx (47A7,48A7) and two strains of ?ppk (5D10, 6D10), along with the parent strain BW25113.Results from the previous experiment found that the phosphate concentrations recorded were far lower when the acid hydrolysis step was incorporated (results not shown).This step was added because we suspected that the ABCAM kit detected phosphate ions but not polyphosphate as the assay was only developed for the detection of orthophosphate, as correspondence with ABCAM, stated that the assay had not been used before to detect polyphosphate.Figure 6: Results from phosphate assay using various volumes of 1M formic acid, neutralised with 6M NaOH before plating.For this we took the media concentration and grew our cells for six hours, after this we took samples of the media and the cell lysate and analysed their phosphate content.To carry this out we used 200uL per well of each sample and used the dye from the ABCAM kit to analyse the phosphate concentration in each sample.After receiving our constructs, we needed to test the amount of phosphate that they could uptake.We also present phosphate amounts within cell lysate using the protocol stated on our wiki in our protocol section (Figure 12 , Figure 14) Within our results, we tested all ppk variant constructs.Therefore we present the amount of phosphate present in the media (Figure 13).This therefore indicates that the chromogenic complex formed between the phosphate reagent dye and the orthophosphate is affected by the formic acid by a decrease in pH.This is contrary to our hypothesis that the concentration of phosphate would increase as the polyphosphate in the cells was hydrolysed.Following from this, we prepared an additional phosphate assay using BW25113, ?ppk and ?ppx using the formic acid hydrolysis at 0uL, 1uL and 5uL of formic acid and neutralising using 6M NaOH.In this assay, we used glassmilk to remove the polyphosphate from the cell lysate.However, if the assay did detect polyphosphate, the phosphate levels would have been roughly the same.We found there was no difference between the phosphate concentrations in the growth media of all cell types under test.This result may have been due to the acid addition and thus resulting in a decrease in pH, affecting the complex formed between the phosphate ions and dye.However we were unable to conduct the same experiment on other constructs due to the MOPS media not being detected by the phosphate assay.This was with the aim of monitoring the change in phosphate concentration in the media following cell growth.For this assay, we used the strains BW25113, ?ppk and ?ppx of the KEIO collection.Our next assay focussed on altering the polyphosphate assay by finding a way to hydrolyse the polyphosphate chains within our modified cells, without affecting the complex formed between the malachite green, ammonium molybdate and inorganic phosphate.This result therefore did not confirm our theory that the kit does not detect polyphosphate and therefore, in order to effectively test the ability of the kit to detect polyphosphate; we planned to use glassmilk solution as a filter in our samples to separate the polyphosphate from the rest of the lysate.Following sonication of the cell samples, we added 50uL of 1 moldm-3 formic acid to hydrolyse the chains of polyphosphate to orthophosphate.These two proteins provide the translocation pathway and the phosphate\x92s uptake is energized by a homodimer of PstB (an ATP-ase protein that hydrolyses ATP).Figure 5: Phosphate assay using glassmilk.Error bars calculated using standard error of mean cellular phosphate concentrations of technical repeats.Error bars calculated using standard error of the mean.Error bars are calculated using standard error of the mean.In order to do this we decided to test the amount of phosphate up taken by a known amount of cells (figure 10).Phosphate ions can then be used for cellular metabolism which includes ATP formation from ADP and phosphate by the F-ATPase protein.BW25113 is the Escherichia coli strain used for the experiment.From our results we found that the most reliable results were gained using 108 cells.However, from the results shown below in figure 2, the acid hydrolysed the DNA resulting in no overlapping peaks.LB was tested however an issue arose where the sample was not diluted sufficiently and a precipitant formed (Figure 7).Graph showing the phosphate concentration of cell lysate of 10^8, cells for 5 different ppk variants and 1 ppx variant after 6 hours.Figure 3: Polyphosphate assay following hydrolysis of polyphosphate chains using varying volumes of 1M formic acid.Figure 4: Polyphosphate assay using varying volumes of formic acid and neutralising using 1M NaOH.We also found that phosphate within the cells can be detected and varied between different strains (Figure 1).As well as using glassmilk to determine cellular polyphosphate concentration, we planned to use NMR to create a spectrum showing two separate peaks for orthophosphate and polyphosphate, of which could have been used to calculate concentration.This was because the phosphate backbone in DNA produces a peak in 31P NMR which overlaps with the orthophosphate peak, making the spectrum difficult to analyse.Error bars show the standard error of the mean from concentrations calculated from technical repeats.Graph showing the phosphate concentration within the media for 5 different ppk variants and 1 ppx variant after 6 hours .As a starting point, we used an ABCAM colorimetric assay kit (ab65622) containing a phosphate reagent dye composed of malachite green and ammonium molybdate.A chromogenic complex is formed between the dye and the phosphate ion (PO43-), producing an intense absorption at around 650nm.This assay involved experimenting with the quantity of cells under test and the volume of sample used in each well.This might be due to the fact that cells were allowed to reach stationary phase induced by phosphate limitation.Preparing glassmilk solution involved using a fume hood located in the chemistry teaching labs and heating concentrated nitric acid almost to boiling; a 50% water to glassmilk slurry was made and stored at room temperature.Figure 4 shows a weak trend between increased formic acid volume and decreased phosphate concentration.For the latter, the substrate binding protein (PstS) of the Phosphate-specific ABC transporter (Pst) binds the phosphate ion.Image acquisition was performed using Carl Zeiss imaging software ZEN (black edition 2012).The pH of the washing buffer should be 7.0 as the DAPI stain does not react with the polyphosphate granules even at the slight variation of pH.Although this may show polyphosphate, this unidentified source could be due to nucleic acids being hydrolysed by the acid.Interaction of polyP with DAPI shifts the emission maxima of the dye from 456 nm emitting blue fluorescence to 526 nm emitting bright yellow- green fluorescence2,3,4.Micrographs of immunostained cell coagulates and tissue sections were captured withNikon Eclipse T300 inverted wide field microscope equipped with a plan apochromat 63x oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).Figure 10 and figure 11 show all three ppks from Candidatus Accumulibacter have shown to be significantly more efficient at collecting phosphate than wild type BW25113.Figure 7: Image of plate showing precipitant due to high phosphate concentrations indicated by arrows.Therefore volumes of 10uL, 15uL, 20uL and 100uL of sample were added to each well to determine best dilution for the ABCAM assay.We found that this addition revealed a source of phosphate which is different from 0 uL of formic acid added.A potential solution to a pH effect was to add 1M NaOH to neutralise the acid hydrolysed solution before adding the phosphate reagent dye.We then tested samples that had been subjected to the glassmilk as well as samples that had not.One way ANOVA was used and the result showed overall there was statistically significant different.Following from this, we ran an assay on three colonies of BW25113 using our pre-prepared glassmilk solution.Biological repeats of a BW25113 colony was used, each set of three repeats contained a different volume of 1M formic acid, ranging between 0uL and 100uL.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'Here a few comments we received:This was an excellent opportunity for the team to gain insight into the publics perspective, particularly that of the older generation.Participants were then required to add strawberries and the extraction solution from the beaker into a zip lock bag.The third and final day of the event gave the students chance to see which team got the most growth depending on the conditions their bioreactor was place in.A discussion was set up with Prof. David Efird a senior lecturer of Philosophy at the University of York.A white suspension forms at the surface of the liquid, this is the DNA.Also we took the opportunity to advertise our project through posters and a video.Overall, the event was very positive and many people said it was great to hear a discussion about the issues of GM.Our team was keen on carrying out an educational workshop with local school students to engage them in science.We were given permission to use the venue to carry out a simple demonstration in which members of the public could isolate DNA from strawberries.We have been featured in the University of Yorks central online news,in student newspaper Nouse and online blog Mind the Horizon.The team took the advantage to talk to perspective biology students at the University of York s open days in June.A small group of our team visited a local primary school with the aim of leading a lesson based on the concept of \x91good\x92 and \x91bad\x92 bacteria.A round table discussion was set up for all recipients of the funding across the university to come speak to members of Santander s team.Our team has had various articles published to raise the profile of the contest and our project.Here we spoke of our project and the general focus of the iGEM competition.To further advertise the contest and our project we produced leaflets to be distributed at an event know as the Festival of Ideas.It became clear in the visit that many of the individuals had little scientific knowledge on the matter but associated the topic with many negative stories from the media.A talk titled \x91The ethics of genetic modification\x92 was organised to discuss the science and ethics behind GM along with introducing our project.10ml of 100% ethanol was measured and then added to the beaker.From this we saw that the number of members agreeing with GM increased but so did the number that disagreed.Many of our visitors discussed the topic of GM with us and kindly left comments at the end of the demonstration.The talk was then carried out to give the participants a better understanding on the topic.During this practical session the students were taught the importance of aseptic techniques in the laboratory setting.For the second day in the labs students were tasked with creating their own \x91bioreactors\x92 to grow their previously transformed cells.With this in mind we designed a segment to be apart of the newsletter that is sent to the Alumni.Our team was fortunate enough to receive funding from Santander Universities to help with the travel costs of getting to the Jamboree in Boston.We wanted to gain an insight into the effects of religious beliefs on people s attitudes to GMOs, which linked to part of our survey we set up.A quarter of teaspoon of salt was then added to the solution and gently mixed.', 'modeling': 'Using the iAF1260 model[1] of E. coli as a basis, we first attempted to look at the reactions controlled by the genes we had found as candidates for manipulation during the team s dry lab period.View OriginalThe FBA computer model looks for the most efficient, if not the most realistic, pathways to use, meaning it was difficult to force any amount of flux through the pathways we had created to accumulate phosphate.As phosphate is used in nearly every part of the cells metabolome, we felt it was important to determine how the accumulation of large amounts might affect the overall function of our organism.These include, Polyphosphate Kinase (PPK), Exopolyphosphatase (PPX), and the Phosphate Specific Transporters (Pst).FBA calculates estimates of the rates at which metabolites in an organism will pass through various reaction pathways.The outcomes of the model also point to potential further developments that are currently out of reach due to the iGEM timeframe, but would greatly develop our final product.One of the immediate problems we found is that phosphate is used by many different parts of the cell, and as such altering any one part has knock on effects on many others.Graph showing correlation between theoretical growth restriction and accumulation of polyphosphate.The results of our model allowed us to better direct the project towards the genes that would give us our desired result, and provide a good starting point for optimising the levels of gene expression.These rates increase in a linear way as further restrictions on growth are put in place, showing direct links between growth and our organisms ability to accumulate phosphate.Figure 2.Each of the red nodes represents a metabolic reaction in which phosphate is a major component.Metabolic pathway map for E. Coli generated from KEGG[2].Results from multiple different attempts to achieve theoretical uptake showed that to be able to accumulate phosphate, growth needed to be compromised.', 'notebook': '12/06:A meeting was held with Yorkshire Water to discuss water remediation processes in the Yorkshire regionSome of us went to a round-table discussion about the impact of Santander at York as some of the team members won the International Connections Award by Santander.', 'protocol': 'Centrifuge @ 6000 rpm for 10 minutes (make sure you use either glass or polypropylene tubes, polystyrene tubes can\x92t withstand over 3000g) Used to measure bacterial density by tracking absorbance at intervals of 30 minutes for 24 or 48 hours (220 rpm, 37°C) Measure OD650 of a 10 fold dilution of cells with a spectrophotometer blanked with MOPS A manual growth assay can be conducted using a spectrometer at OD650.SpeI, XbaI ,and EcoRI-HF have 100% Buffer activity with either NEBuffer 2.1 or Cutsmart while PstI digestions work best with 3.1Put 500?l of Buffer PW1 per 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube used in heat block heated to 50?CRepeat stage 4 using the same ISOLATE II Plasmid Mini Spin Column and 2ml Collection Tube with the clarified sample supernatant from the other 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube from the same sample.We incubated our samples in a heat block at 50°C for 15 minutes when 2 or 3 fragments are being assembled or 60 minutes when 4-6 fragments are being assembled.These can then be plotted onto a growth curve and if desired sample can be detect from phosphate assay though for reliable media testing results MOPS would be recommended.A recommend of 1mM phosphate can be used to get adequate cell growth without causing precipitation providing media is diluted by a 1in 20 dilution.Instead 1x MOPS media, 4 mg/ml glucose and a known concentration of phosphate can be used.Background control sample wells = 1 \x96 100 samples (adjust volume to 200 µL/well with ddH2O).Make sure our sample is diluted to ensure the readings are within the standard value range.Harvest the amount of cells necessary for each assay (initial recommendation = 2 x 10^6 cells).Sonicate cells for 50 seconds 3X at high setup (one cycle = 30 s sonication \x96 10 s break \x96 10 s sonication \x96 10 s break).It is recommended to assay all standards, controls and samples in duplicate.Sample wells = 1 \x96 100 µL samples (adjust volume to 200 µL/well with ddH2O).An initial start OD650 of 0.1 is used and then 1ml of sample can be removed from the conical flask hourly and optical density taken.Add 30 µL of Phosphate Reagent to standard, sample and background control wells.Samples are prepared in 50ml LB as (> 12hrs) in a 250ml conical flask, as MOPS media can be too slow.0.5 mL of culture- grow with shaking until ~ 0.375 OD (at 600 nm) -

Expression of the high light-inducible Dunaliella LIP promoter in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.We yet decided to use it, mainly because of the lack of other alternatives and the great effort of optimizing it ourselves, and because only a very low Cas9 expression should be required to enable target gene knockout.By inducing the expression of Cas9 in C. reinhardtii at the biomass peak, before nitrogen starvation, more TAG-bodies would accumulate without affecting the growth rate of the algae.Our construct is designed to demonstrate the functionality of an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in C. reinhardtii.The construct is thought to convey inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of a specific metabolic target gene, directing the cells flux of carbon sources towards triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis.Knockout of metabolic target genes in C. reinhardtii has been successfully performed many times before.For example, knocking out the sta6 gene in C. reinhardtii, encoding the starch synthesis enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, results in accumulation of 20\xa0% less biomass during nutrient-replete conditions (2).Lastly, we have a hygromycin resistance gene (aph7), serving as selection marker for successful transformation of C. reinhardtii.The construct is constituted by six DNA fragments, assembled by Gibson assembly and designed accordingly.The function of the last fragment is to enable selection of successfully transformed colonies of C. reinhardtii.Inhibition of target of rapamycin signaling by rapamycin in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Theoretically, the YFP reporter gene could also serve as a selection marker, therefore we continued with the primer design.Despite multiple attempts, the assembly has not been fully successful, yet.Baek K, Lee Y, Nam O, Park S, Sim SJ, Jin E. Introducing Dunaliella LIP promoter containing light-inducible motifs improves transgenic expression in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.There are several variants of inducible promoters that could be used in C. reinhardtii to express a gene such as Cas9 at given stimuli, and many of these promoters include addition and removal of chemicals.Metabolic and photosynthetic consequences of blocking starch biosynthesis in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sta6 mutant.The path to triacylglyceride obesity in the sta6 strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.A protein sensitive to rapamycin, naturally occurring in plants, including the algae of interest, C. reinhardtii (7).It includes of a codon optimized hygromycin resistance gene, Aph7, which can be used as a selection marker (8).Despite that the use of a light-inducible knockout promotor in a photosynthetic organism might seem contradictory, it has its advantages due to its manageability.2015 Apr [cited 2016 Sep 4];99(8):3491\x96503.2013 Dec [cited 2016 Sep 4];238(6):1147\x9656.Goncalves EC, Wilkie AC, Kirst M, Rathinasabapathi B.

potential complexity of using chemicals for this purpose, we decided to use high-intensity light as promotor stimulus.An insert that appeared to be correct was transformed into C. reinhardtii but selection failed, and the insert later proved to be wrong (see results).1.The theoretical functionality of this part is questionable due to its lack of codon optimization for C. reinhardtii.4-5. sgRNA

yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was inserted into the construct to substitute for the Hyg selection.The colonies with the proper base length were sequenced and it could be determined that Cas9 and LIP had successfully been inserted into the vector, whilst sgRNA, U6 and Hygromycin cassette (Hyg) were not incorporated.The constructed vector, which included YFP instead of Hyg, was transformed into the algae with electroporation.Furthermore, three constructs with the fragments LIP, LIP-RFP and terminator were successfully obtained.A big part of LiU iGEM\x92s project is the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.However, the effectivity of this method was quite low and the approach on the assembly needed to be modified.Since no hygromycin resistant could be utilized everything grew on the plates and there was no selection on the plates.The colonies were screened with fluorescent microscope, but because of the difficulties to detect YFP the conclusion was that the electroporation was not successful.', 'safety': 'To ensure no mutated bacteria or algae got outside the lab, each laborant sterilized their hands aswell as the lab bench they were working with.For chemicals that had a pungent odor (i.e acetic acid), or was poisonous (i.e hygromycin), or for any other type of hazards, we handled these chemicals under a fume hood with nitrile gloves and saftey glasses with outmost care.iGEM has two major guidelines for laboratory work during a project: No genetically modified organisms should be released outside the lab.The first guideline does not apply since all our parts and organisms are classified as riskgroup 1 at the highest.This rule becomes especially crucial if the organism is classified as a GMO.The question therefore follows; should our projcet be considered as GMO?Yes we do have a genetically modified eukaryotic organism, however despite it being genetically modifed, by defintion it is not to be considered as GMO since we have been using CRISPR/Cas9 system to cut a gene without inserting new DNA.Residues of Hutners trace elements, which contained the heavy metals cobalt(II) and copper(II) were disposed of in a waste container for heavy metals.It is of outmost importance that the products that you ship for sequencing or to the registry are transported in a safe and secure manner.The chassis we are using are a non-pathogenic XL-1 blue E.coli strain and all the parts included are unharmful to humans and other organisms.The main project challenge was to ensure that our genetically modified C.reinhardtii would not pose any threat to other wild type algae.The FDA [1], as well as the swedish agriculture department [2] considers the use of CRISPR/Cas9 not to be GMO if you use the system only to cut a gene.At LiU iGEM our main concern has always been safety.Since we were using risk group 1 organisms we were working on a lab bench and always wearing lab coats, saftey glasses and latex/nitrile gloves.This is especially true since our goal is to eventually modify the chloroplast, which, when modfied will severly weaken C.reinhardtii to grow outside in the wild.To assure that no modified C.reinhardtii would escape into the wild this system will be activated by light, so that ordinary sunlight would be sufficient to shut down the organism.Saftey is paramount when working in the laboratory, and this project is no expection.Even if the algae did not belong to any risk group, they were treated as though they are risk group 1 organisms.But, since our parts were sequenced in Germany the shipment to that destination will be discussed here.When our parts were ready to be sequenced we contacted our secondary PI, which had contacts with a sequence company and asked for help with sending it to the company.Careful considerations must be taken when it comes to shipping of biological parts, it would be rather careless and unfriendly for the environment if a gene or a biological part got damaged or leaked out due to improper care during transport.The results usually came after 1 week, which was the standard time, indicating there were no problems with shipment regarding the sequencing matter.1.Since our parts where shipped after the wiki freeze we can not tell about any specifics about how the shipment went for the parts to iGEM:s headquarters.However, we modify a species, C. reinhardtii, which can be applied to the second guideline.', 'keywords': 'reinhardtii anthocyanin hypotaurine chloroplast examinations Chlamydomonas fluorescence chemoreceptors BabbleBricks electrochemical', 'track': 'Environment',

thus they are easier to deform (Cooper et al, 2002).Graphene only absorbs 2.3% of incident light, indicating that it is a good candidate to build transparent electronic components such as electrodes, polarizers, and ultrafast lasers (Tsakmakidis, 2013).Graphene´s quality is important since any deformations produced by impurities, structural disorders or wrinkles can directly impact in its properties, resulting in a material with poor electronic and optical applicability.Nowadays, there are two major bottlenecks when talking about production of high quality graphene:First, its mass production, since it is very difficult to produce large amounts of graphene with needed qualities for electrical sectors given that it must have a high conductivity and optical transparency.Secondly, actual methods to synthesize graphene involve the usage of hazardous chemicals, like hydrazine, that generate toxic gases and waste.To address these issues, it is imperative to develop a greener process with an eco-friendly approach, since the demand of this material will increase, and as such, its pollutants if the process is not modified.From all these methods, the chemical reduction is the most likely to be used in mass production given that its disadvantages vary according to the reducing agent Actually, hydrazine is the reducing agent of choice, but its toxicity has pushed researchers to look for other alternatives .In the table below, the electrical conductivity of rGO is shown as a function of the chemical involved in its synthesis.Cooper, D., D\x92Anjou, B., Ghattamaneni, N.,

indicated by the blue arrow on pSBBS0K-P (left part of the figure).Position of the primers are indicated by the blue arrow on pSBBS0K-P (left part of the figure).Only one of such plasmid is described in the iGEM registry (pSBBS0K-P from iGEM Munich 2012; BBa_K823026 and its slightly modified form BBa_K1351040).After digestion by NheI and self-ligation, the resulting pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid was obtained (right part of the figure).The new plasmid size is smaller by 3604 bp.The sequence integrity of the OriKan cassette was also verified.Figure 3: validation of the pSB1C3-Orikan presence in B. subtilis.Nhe1 restriction site was also added at the 5\x92 end of each primers to circularize the PCRFigure 1: reduction of the pSBBS0K-P plasmid.We therefore decided to operate a reduction of the plasmid size.We reasoned that most of the pSBBS0K-P plasmid content were of no need to our project (lacY, rfp,lacI\x85).There was no such part in the registry.The resulting PCR fragment is the blue pointed line.The resulting PCR fragment is the blue pointed line.Itscapacity to simply functionalize any registry part for Bacillus subtilis (and likely some other grampositive strains) is invaluable for the ever growing numbers of iGEM projects based on theseorganisms.In this context, obtaining the pSBBS0K-Minihas been a great step forward for us as it allowed a fast progression of our project cloning steps.Moreover, we are also very proud of the OriKan biobrick.PCR on colonies was performed using primers hybridizing in the kanamycine resistance gene and in the suffix.', 'design': 'Besides, Bacillus species are inhabitants of the cave (Martin-Sanchez et al, 2014) and Bacillus subtilis is a model microorganisms with well-established genetic possibilities, i.e, the perfect chassis for our project (Figure 2).Figure 2: In the cave, Pseudomonas species degrade the antifungal molecules previously used to prevent mould apparition.Our Bacillus strain will develop from Pseudomonas, and in contact to fungi, will produce antifungal molecules to prevent mould development.Two independent operons have been reported to allow for the predation property of Bacillus subtilis: the sporulation killing factor (skf) and the sporulation delay protein (sdp) (Gonzalez-Pastor et al, 2003; Ellermeier et al, 2006; Gonzalez-Pastor, 2011).NheI, SacII and SalI restrictions sites were added to further facilitate the modules assembly.To express the antifungal peptides only in presence of the fungi, we selected the Bacillus promoter of nagA and nagP, reported to be induced in presence of NAG (Bertram et al., 2011).5 different molecules were selected:- D4E1, a 17 amino acids synthetic peptide analog to Cecropin B AMPs which has been shown to have antifungal activities by complexing with a sterol present in the conidia\x92s wall of numerous fungi (De Lucca et al, 1998).We also designed the toxin/antitoxin systems in a way that one of the toxin gene could be inserted in the middle of the antifungal operon (SacII/SalI insertion, figure 8).These lead us to divide our project in three modules (Containment, Predation, Antifungal; Figure 1).Figure 1: Bacillus subtilis transformed with the two plasmids carrying the elements necessary to promote predation, to prevent the plasmid dissemination, and to produce antifungals molecules.The Lascaux history has proved that any molecule addition could result in major and unexpected modifications of the cave microbiota.One plasmid contains antitoxin 1 and toxin 2, the other contains antitoxin 2 and toxin 1.Figure 6: concept of the double toxin/antitoxin system.The two pairs of Toxin-Antitoxin combinations selected for this project are MazF/MazE (Bravo et al., 1987, Zhang et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2013) and Zeta/Epsilon (Zielenkiewicz and Ceg?owski, 2005 ; Mutschler et al., 2011).Since their expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, we decided to replace their promoter by pVeg for a constitutive expression (Figure 3).This molecule is the major component of chitin found at the surface of the fungi.To simplify the cloning, we designed two genetics modules: Antifungal A and Antifungal B. Antifungal A expresses the cut Metchnikowin and D4E1, while Antifungal B produces entire Metchnikowin, GAFP-1 and Dermaseptin-b1 (figure 4).We circumvented this difficulty by taking advantage of the predatory property of Bacillus subtilis: in starvation condition, one program of Bacillus is to produce toxins to kill other bacteria such as Pseudomonas species and to develop from their materials (Nandy et al, 2007).As we did not know if this cleavage is essential for the antifungal activity, we choose to use either the cut or entire form of this peptide (Levashina et al, 1995).Since treating with antifungal molecules has proved to be at the best a limited option, we wonder about how to produce antifungal in a targeted and efficient way.Since a variety of mould has been identified to cause problem in the cave, we wanted a wide spectrum solution and decided for an antifungal cocktail.The toxin and antitoxin are under control of the pVeg constitutive promoter for Bacillus subtilis (BBa_K143012; Figure 5).The EcoRI/NheI fragment containing a pNag promoter (figure 5) will have to be swapped with the EcorI/NheI fragment containing the pVeg promoter of the antifungal operon (figure 4).This peptide is membranotropic and depolarizes the fungi plasma membrane (Fleury et al, 1998).- GAFP-1 (Gastrodia Anti Fungal Protein 1), a mannose and chitin binding lectin originating from the Asiatic orchid Gastrodia elata, that inhibits the growth of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungal plant pathogens (Wang et al, 2001).For example, the antifungal molecules abundantly used to fight against fungi infection have been degraded by Pseudomonas fluorescens, and this degraded molecules are used by fungi to proliferate\x85 A major constraint we imposed to our project was thus to avoid adding nutriment in the cave.25: 651\x96661Our project involved release of a genetically modified bacteria in the cave.The description of the device structure and use is available in the Modeling section.All the parts from the three modules were designed to be easily assembled (Figure 9).To valid the expression and specificity of these promoters, the RFP reporter gene has been placed under their control (Figure 5).These sequences encodes the necessary elements to produce, mature and secrete the killing factors, as well as the immunity agents to prevent lethality of the producing cells.Ellermeier CD, Errett CH, Gonzalez-Pastor JE, and Losick R (2006) A Three-Protein Signaling Pathway Governing Immunity to a Bacterial Cannibalism Toxin.RFP expression was also added in prevision of a visualisation of the strain during test on stones.Figure 3: Predation constructions.44: 514\x96520 Fleury Y, Vouille V, Beven L, Amiche M, Wróblewski H, Delfour A & Nicolas P (1998) Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and gene structure of a novel member of the dermaseptin B family.It was mandatory to ensure the best confinement strategy for our strain, to limit the material input in the cave and to ensure antifungal production only when required.The rationale for this was to have the toxin as close as possible to the antifungal molecule to further reduce the risk of antifungal gene horizontal transfer.For the secretion of these antifungal compounds, we added the AmyE signal peptide in N-terminal of each coding sequences.NheI restrictions sites were added to further facilitate the modules assembly.Bertram R, Rigali S, Wood N, Lulko AT, Kuipers OP & Titgemeyer F (2011) Regulon of the N-acetylglucosamine utilization regulator NagR in Bacillus subtilis.This has two valuable advantages: (i) no substrate are required when using the bacteria, and (ii) our Bacillus will reduce the deleterious population of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Martin-Sanchez et al, 2011).The device has been designed to be stuck on the cave wall and to be easily manipulated.Finally, if we decided to use the common Bacillus subtilis 168 strain for the modules validation, the final chassis was choosen to be a double mutant Spo0A- recA-.581: 151\x9656.The Paleotilis project main idea is to contain the fungi patch progression in the Lascaux cave.Identification of components of a new stability system of plasmid R1, ParD, that is close to the origin of replication of this plasmid.It is unusual in the sense theophylline riboswitches usually work in the inverse way (Topp and Gallivan, 2008).Developing a biological solution to protect one of the most invaluable humanity heritage is a beautiful challenge.The risk to release a GMO in the cave is mainly in the horizontal gene transfer to native bacteria.Since each fragment contains a toxin but not its corresponding antitoxin, we needed a strategy to avoid cell death during the cloning steps.Besides, we wanted to express these peptides only in close vicinity of the fungi.We decided for a double toxin-antitoxin system (Figure 6).Indeed, at this step of the project, the risk about using this GMO in the cave is unknown.193:

art, it deserves to exist, to be maintained and protected.We should never consider Nature and living beings solely as work tools.In the European Union, the legal definition of GMO is mentioned in the 2001/18 directive: a GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) is \x93an organism, with the exception of human beings, whose genetic makeup has been modified via methods that do not occur in nature and/or through traditional crossbreeding methods\x94.However, the regulation regarding GMOs varies from a country to another as far as research, production, marketing and their use are concerned.Indeed, at the time of the Renaissance, an interesting definition of art appears: it is a disinterested and free activity, pleasant in itself, having no utility for production.However, after getting in touch with scientists and people working in the Lascaux cave, it turned out that we will be able to test our genetically modified bacteria in a "cave test".Among others, we contacted Yvan Moënne-Loccoz, part of the scientific council of the Lascaux cave and Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle Director of the National Museum of Prehistory.It is obvious that any project involving the release of genetically modified bacteria in an ecosystem, needs an in-depth studies to evaluate the evolution of the ecosystem following the addition of a genetically modified native bacterium.Although the issues raised by OGM in the public mainly concern plants (GMP) and more recently also animals (GMA) including Human because of the ease of manipulate organisms with the powerful CRISPR-Cas9 tools, we need to think about the ethics of our iGEM project and share our thinking with the public.To fuel our thinking, beside reading few publications, we were lucky enough to be able to regularly discuss with Dr Vincent Grégoire-Delory, Head of the \x93Ecole Supérieure d\x92Ethique des Sciences\x94 in Toulouse.It belongs to no one and is not the object of desire: it is there for contemplation of a generation, and then transmitted to the next.These frescoes show the representation that men had of their world 18,000 years ago.It carries a message and a memory of the Paleolithic man.Some philosophers of aesthetics, defined art as "sensitive knowledge": an autonomous knowledge which is opposed to knowledge through concepts.Thus, it is necessary to know what might be the impact of our modified microorganism on the environment before using it to treat the caves.For the artist, art is also used to escape and to express themselves.It is through the power and intelligence of men that we can organize the formless and chaos of the real world in a style, an expression.Against this statistic and for modestly contribute to the fight for men-women parity, we would like to demonstrate that only complementary skills are the secret ingredient to the success in this competition, beyond the gender.At the heart of the synthetic biology iGEM competition is the modification of microorganisms and therefore the creation of genetically modified microorganisms (GMM), a sub-category of the genetically modified organisms (OGM) that also include higher organisms such as animals and plants.Alongside more traditional methods currently used against these fungi, we decided to act with the most modern means from this emerging science that is synthetic biology, to contribute to the preservation of an ancient heritage and to ensure its transmission to future generations.Whatever would be the answer, we believe that respecting living beings first and foremost rests on scientific integrity and rigor, a realization of all the implications of the scientific project, the precise knowledge of its content, and finally the establishment of security measure.This art does not represent the time of the hunting scenes as one might imagine.While participating to an exhibition on genetics at the \x93Museum d\x92Histoire Naturelle\x94 in Toulouse, we also have had the opportunity to discuss with Dr Anne Cambon-Thomsen, Head of the \x93Plateforme Génétique & Société\x94 of Toulouse and member of European ethics committees.From all these readings and discussions, we realized that as far as ethics issues are concerned, there are two main point of views, anthropocentrism vs biocentrism, that would deeply impact on the outcome of any debate.General considerations.Is it a lack of respect to nature and the living in general to insert a gene controlling insulin production into a bacterium if that means saving thousands of human lives?Let\x92s not forget that the Lascaux cave is not an usual work of art, not only by age but especially by the presence of life.Like the links of a long human chain, the Lascaux cave shows to future generations a work executed by ancient men.In spite of the absence of definite answer, we can question ourselves differently: when is an organism considered \x93modified\x94?We have also participated to a workshop on Genetically Modified Microorganism organized by the \x93Plateforme Génétique & Société\x94 whose guest stars were Pr Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent from Paris, members of ethics committees and Pr.However, it is sometimes difficult to quantify the risks and visualize the limit between what could be really dangerous for humanity and what is not.Thereby, thanks to the awareness raised to this debate, numerous precautions have been taken to avoid the dissemination of GMOs, because the scientific community does not know their exact effects on the environment.Will we actually counteract this law of nature by saving the frescoes in the cave?In fact, the cave has a very complex ecosystem, diverse and constantly interacting.Places as amazing and diverse as the Serra da Capivara National Park in Brazil, the Pyramids of Egypt, Trogir historic town in Croatia are the heritage of our world.Sphinx and Chephren-Pyramid, Serra da Capivara National Park (Brazil), Historic city of TrogirAmong the 1052 world treasures that need to be saved, the Lascaux cave and the impressive frescos by their number and aesthetic quality are listed since October 1979 (ICOMOS Recommendation).Even today, ephemeral art is practiced for example in the Landart.However, efforts are still needed for a much fair treatment of women in order to grant full equality in all countries around the world.In the left: Caroline Herschel , in the right: Marie CurieThus today, what is happening is that only 8 young women are involved in the iGEM adventure in Toulouse.Formerly simply meaning "study of the living", it is now more complex because we are able to transform the living.Indeed, the walls of the cave are partially and gradually covered with black and white mushrooms that hide the frescoes.Respectively : Sand Art Festival Tossens, Localisation of the Lascaux cave, The lascaux caveWhy save art?He adds that if there are many consequences possible when using a technology, one has to decide [to use the technology or not] according to the most pessimistic hypothesis.In France, this principle is applied for the use of GMOs and allows avoiding to the maximum the risks endangering health and the environment.For many prehistorians, the cave is actually a sanctuary, a sort of religious monument.Not to say, we are quite proud of the results!Thus, Nietzsche promotes art as the purest and spiritual entertainment.There is no parietal cave in the world that matches it in terms of the quality and variety of the finds (skeletons, objects, flint, various utensils).This study shows that the ecosystem\x92s modification in this project is not significant.It states that \x93the lack of certainties, given the scientific and technical knowledge of the moment, shall not delay the adoption of effective and proportionate measures that aim to prevent a risk of severe and irreversible harm to the environment to a cost economically acceptable\x94.This allowed the estimate of the risks associated with the future use of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) in crops.For the NASA, \x93life is an auto-maintained system, capable of Darwinian evolution\x94 (Gerald Joyce, 1992).It is thus important to act responsibly, with integrity and full conscience, and to evaluate the risks linked to using GMOs.The Lascaux caves since 1979 belongs to the World Heritage of UNESCO.The opening of the cave by humans causing an imbalance in the ecosystem, one would think it\x92s only coherent that men attempt to repair their mistakes.The site is particularly interesting from ethnological, anthropological and aesthetic point of views, marking a milestone in the history of prehistoric art and our human culture.The questions raised are often linked to them, but the confusion is present and the reluctance seems to affect all GMOs.The risks are not the same for each category of GMOs, and to the best of our knowledge, for the moment no major health or environmental problems associated to MGMs have been reported despite more than 70 years of MGMs manipulation in academic or private laboratories.Regarding specifically the scientific area, many women have raised the flag of parity such as Caroline Herschel, the first woman recognized as scientist but also the first one to publish a scientific paper in 1786 about the discovery of a comet, or such as Marie Curie who obtained two Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry.Indeed, the ecosystem of the cave is very delicate and vital for the preservation of the frescoes.Indeed, one may think that science is useful only when it is in the service of health or the environment.This peculiar and quite funny situation has somehow triggered our thinkingabout the actual position of women in Science, specially taking into account that our principalResults of a vast survey on the role of women in scientific research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group were published in March 2014 in the European Union, show that only 11% of the highest academic posts are occupied by women in science subjects.As far as the iGEM competition is concerned, only genetically modified microorganisms are pertinent.Mahaffee, W. F. & Kloepper, J. W. Bacterial communities of the rhizosphere and endorhiza associated with field-grown cucumber plants inoculated with a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium or its genetically modified derivative.Indeed, the birth of synthetic biology has created a revolution in the world of biology as important as the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Watson and Crick or the first complete sequencing of a human genome in 2003.Indeed, American policy is based on the product of gene modification techniques, not on the process itself.It is with the PGMs that the debate has emerged.At the end of the selection process, it turned out that the most appropriate candidates were all women!As said before, the walls of the cave are partially and gradually covered with black and white fungi that hide the frescoes.Or maybe, we could be satisfied with the survival to transmit this work as long as possible to the future generations?It may be possible in the near future to get the same results for our project and why not imagine being able to reopen the cave to the public in the future?1.Actually the selection to be part of the team was made based on the skill and motivation of the student and not on his gender.These disappear with the tide and weather.Notwithstanding, wildlife depicted on walls of the cave does not match the species hunted and consumed at the time.A single reindeer engraved was found when it seems that it was very consumed at the time.Père Puigdomenech from Barcelona, member of European ethics committees, co-organized by the \x93Académie des Sciences, Inscriptions et Belles Lettres\x94 of Toulouse.Thus it enables taking safety precautions even if the risk in question is not demonstrated or proven.It gives an encouraging result for the use of synthetic biology.Actually more than 300 definitions have been collected by the astrophysicist Radu Popa (2010).In France, the confined use of GMMs is subject, via the 2009/41/CE directive, to a system of notification and authorization.Indeed, others techniques exist at present to try to slow the progression of fungi in the Lascaux caves.The field of biology evolves very quickly thanks to the technological advances that we witness day by day.We need to remove the black and white fungi while preserving the balance of the ecosystem.A very interesting law was written in 1995: the Barnier\x92s law, more known as the precautionary principle.Their irruption in the production processes went almost unnoticed.Clearly, women are underrepresented in scientific professions.Nevertheless, these percentages are slowly increasing, mainly because women are fighting for to reach the goal that the parity would be respected in all levels of society.We have also attended a seminar on genome editing given by the Pr.Moreover, despite all our efforts, the world tends toward entropy (second law of thermodynamics), which means that the universe tends toward disorder and disintegration.It is natural that suspicion emerges in the minds of the public when they only have a vague idea of ??what this new discipline is, and the safety measures implemented to minimize the risks.The regulation is based on other criteria than the ones applied inside the European Union.This prehistoric site is located in the French countryside.Still, the frescoes are extremely realistic in terms of morphology and attitudes of animals.In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Buddhist conceived mandalas (support for meditation and visualization, symbol of the universe) in the sand (very sensitive material overtime).Indeed, the World Heritage sites belong to everyone, irrespective of the territory in which they are located.In 1946, representatives of 37 countries met in London to sign and enforce the Constitution UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), defining the concept of world heritage and establishing an initial list of this heritage.They were even perceived well since they were able to engender more reliable products, as it was the case with the production of the growth hormone.The regulation is founded on verifiable risks and does not focus on the risks that were not proven (for more details see the precautionary principle).As mentioned in the introduction, distinction must be done between different kinds of GMOs (GMMs, PGMs, etc\x85).', 'modeling': 'Therefore the simulation should help us know how much bacteria should be used to treat the mould patches, when the job is finished, and when the bacteria should have disappeared.It was designed has a simple interface (figure 2) and is totally open to the iGEM community and beyond (Link coming soon).Figure 2: image of the prey-predator model interface.The confinement device (figure 4) was designed has a transparent glass bell (5) mounted on a soft sucking pad (6) to stick to the cave wall.To predict how the strain will behave in the cave environment, we decided to use a modeling strategy and created a prey-predator model.These numbers will be implemented in the model to refine its prediction and hence optimize the approach until the results are satisfying enough to start test in laboratory caves.Perspectives: the laboratory cave and other applicationsThe described iterative approach will help to settle the best conditions to apply our project in the Lascaux cave.Each one of them could help respond to a particular issue of the Lascaux cave and all of them combined would tackle all the aspect of the Lascaux cave\x92s situation.The concept of our project could be used for other applications as well.Optionally, an UV ramp could be mounted inside the chamber, either to reveal the bacteria if they express a fluorescent marker, or to ensure killing of the recA- Bacillus strain (this background allows reducing the risk of recombination \x96 see the design part-, and is therefore very sensitive to UV).The device will have to be used during test on stone in laboratory condition.These caves are all located in France, and have similarities with the Lascaux cave in terms of bacterial and fungal populations.It means using the strain to treat mould patches as it would be done in the cave.However, each cave is unique and the microbiologists that work on the cave decided to develop a network of laboratory caves.Once satisfactory predictions are obtained, the next step toward the laboratory cave would be initiated.Figure 1: description of our strategy to anticipate the use of Paleolitis in the Lascaux cave.We conceived this step as an iterative strategy (figure 1).They therefore use laboratory caves where various treatments are performed and fully analysed before deciding to use them directly on the cave.There are experts in such approaches and we decided to focus on the step between the completion of our strain and this laboratory validation.The cave is very poor in growth substrates and the production of toxin should also make the bacteria unstable.They also do not act on the cave until they know the exact consequences of the treatments they plan on applying.We therefore assumed that the Paleolitis strain should not maintain in this environment.We designed a prey-predator model to predict how Paleolitis and the fungi will behave.Anyway, such a test could be easily adapted to try out the model predictions and the device functionality.Sampling during and after the predicted time could be done and qRT-PCR performed to measure how the fungal and bacterial populations evolved.At the end of our summer work, our strain Paleolitis was not complete yet.Bacterial suspension at the concentration indicated by the model is placed in the chamber (1).The device is placed on top of the mould patch and bacterial suspension is sprayed on the confined surface (figure 5) using the sprinkler inside the bell (3).We felt that we should use all the solutions available for the confinement and we designed a device to physically contain our strain during the treatment.We deposited on the stones several mixes including ochre, substrates, Bacillus subtilis expressing the antifungal AF_A operon, and fungi (figure 6).', 'notebook': 'Moreover, in order to reduce the size of our replicative plasmid pSB0K-P, we designed primers that were supposed to amplify both the origin of replication and the antibiotic resistance gene for B. subtilis and E. coli.The bacteria we are modifying is supposed to improve the predation capacity of B. subtilis.By amplifying by PCR pSB0K-P to select only the kanamycine gene and the replication origin in B. subtilis, and by ligating it with pSB1C3, we should obtain a plasmid replicative in E. coli and in B. subtilis.As the cloning with pNagA is validated, we started trying to clone this insert in the shuttle plasmid pSB0K-P from 2012 iGEM Munich team, and to transform it in E. coli.Thus, we start trying to clone the good amplicons in the backbone pSB1C3, but it fail because of a lack of genetic material.We asked to iGEM Munich 2012 to send us four shuttle backbones, that can be used in E. Coli as well as in B. subtilis.The bacteria that our B. subtilis is supposed to limit the growth is Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25.We have done PCR on the big pSB0K-P plasmid to reduce its size, from 9,3 kbp to 5,7 kbp, hoping the cloning will become easier.It was useful to determine if our B. subtilis is able to affect the growth of other bacteria.The plasmid pSB0K-Mini can be replicated in E. coli, but the antibiotic resistance functional in this bacterium is the ampicillin.For the modelling, we designed the prey-predator model to have a simulation of the activity of our modified B. subtilis.We continued trying to clone our insert pNagA in the shuttle plasmid pSB0K-P, using different strategies.The cloning of our three inserts in the pSB0K-Mini worked, and we also succeed in transforming B. subtilis with these constructions.The problems with the Gibson cloning are still present, but the origin of the disturbance is unknown.We started to test our promoter pNagA in B. subtilis.Due to these data we determined the doubling time of each conditions, and we selected the best one.Now that the small version of the plasmid pSB0K-P is circularized, we transformed it in Bacillus subtilis.In addition, the antibiotic resistance genes would be the one expected: chloramphenicol for E. coli, and kanamycine for B. subtilis.We used these strains in order to: have a positive control when our bacteria will be functional, test the efficiency of the antifungals, and find the best temperature, medium and technique.We started to clone our gBlocks pNagA, mazF and AfA in this plasmid.Problems with the cloning in pSB1C3 of our predation genes were still present.As the gBlocks were received, we did PCR to amplify them and create a stock.In order to determine if our bacteria is more efficient than the wild type bacteria, we have done predation tests by using the strain WT 168.We have done PCR, digestion, ligation, and transformation for clonings during a week, being supervised by PhD students.In parallel, we finished ordering gBlocks from IDT, and we refined the gene design.First of all, we had to digest the backbone pSB1C3, which have to received each of our parts.We designed it using Blender.The transformation of E. coli with the construction of a NagA inducible promoter in pSB1C3 worked, it was the first big step!The clonings did not work.As the PCR of gBlocks do not work very well, we designed other primers to improve the compatibility between the template and the primers.In 2014, the iGEM Toulouse team worked on fungi, and constructed strains able to secrete antifungals.We have done experiments realizing cultures in different conditions during the all day, and we measured the OD every hour.What we have done: ordered the material (enzymes, kit\x85)necessary for the projectHaving a good control of the basic experiments, as enzymatic digestion or transformation for example, is important to ensure the lab work during the summer.We tried different programs, by modifying the elongation time or the hybridization temperature.The genes (sdp and skf) for our predation module should be cloned by the Gibson method.Dry lab: Now that the subject is defined, and that the bibliography is done, let\x92s prepare our constructions!We also determined what was the more efficient between using the supernatant, the bacteria, or a mix of both.Nevertheless this plasmid is quite big (>9 kbp) and thus it is harder to clone than a smallest plasmid.', 'protocol': 'Transfer the GeneJET purification column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge

to prevent expression during the cloning step in E. coli, or to try a direct transformation of highly competent Bacillus strain.Here, we aimed to produce a cocktail of five antifungal peptides whose production in Bacillus subtilis will be triggered by presence of fungi.The whole antifungal operon was too big to be synthesized by IDT as one gblock.).At this step, we can only hypothesize that our system is leaking sufficient expression of the toxins for them to be lethal, either in E. coli or in B. subtilis.Again, we can only speculate about the toxicity of the toxin.To validate the theophylline riboswitch, we inferred that we should obtain clones of Bacillus subtilis transformed with the pSBBS0K-Mini \x96Epsilon/MazF only in presence of theophylline: the molecule should prevent the expression of the MazF toxin that is lethal since the antitoxin MazE is not present.However, we did not manage to obtain the whole assembly (figure 2), neither partial ones, in spite of about 20 attempts\x85The SDP operon is smaller than the SKF one and it was possible to obtain the optimized sequences as two gblocks.Figure 11: Result of the Bacillus subtilis transformation with pSBBS0K-Mini \x96Epsilon/MazF (we know this is not the most illustrative figure ever!They were subsequently cloned in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobricks BBA_K1937004 and BBa_K1937006.We tested the expression and specificity of the RFP driven by pNagA and pNagP when growing in presence of glucose or NAG (figure 7).However, we did not manage to obtain the second operon in the pSB1C3 (encoding Dermaseptin B1, GAFP-1 and entire Metchnikowin antifungal peptides).The predation system is based on the production of toxins by B. subtilis, and these toxins were reported to be harmful to E. coli (Nandy et al., 2007, FEBS Letters.The fungi were then inoculated on each spot whereas our therapeutic agent only on Spot 8.Figure 9: Test on the rock inoculated with Talaromyces funiculosum at T=0 (on the left) and T=3 weeks post infection (on the right).After 3 weeks, the growth of fungi was clearly visible on spots 1 to 6, with the most efficient growth on the spot 3 which had the following medium composition:Interestingly, no growth of the fungus was observed on spots 7 and 8.The AF_A operon was subsequently cloned in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobrick BBA_K1937008.Figure 5: Layout of antifungal operons and their assembly.In order to express specifically the antifungal peptides in close vicinity to fungi, we choose the two N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG) inducible promotors pNagA and pNagP.In conclusion, pNagA and pNagP appear as able to promote expression in response to NAG, even if the growth conditions could be improved to get higher and more homogeneous expression levels.Figure 7: NAG-driven expression of RFP.The first step was therefore to be able to grow fungi on rocks.In order to do so, we have deposed on the surface of the rocks growth media with various nutriment compositions (see Table 1).However, the ability to get the fungi grown on rock was already a good result, indicating that we might have a good model to test our bacteria.Red spots appeared only with pNagA or pNagP on NAG (close-ups on part 7B).We found out that the best culture conditions for the fungi that permits a slight growth of Bacillus were with ¼ PDA and 2% glucose.We observed that the reaction seems to be effective with the presence of a new band corresponding to the combined size of the two gblocks (figure 4).The Epsilon/MazF construction was rapidly sub-cloned in the pSB1C3 backbone (new composite part BBa_K1937009), and then in the pSBBS0K-Mini plasmid to create biobricks BBa_K1937010 (figure 10).We tested the predation of B. subtilis Wild Type (strain 168) against Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain SBW25), a deleterious strain present in the cave.Briefly, the protocol consists in growing both strains in rich medium, mixing them in PBS and monitoring their growth (figure 1).To get rid of restriction sites that could interfere with the cloning steps, we ordered the optimized sequences from IDT as four gblocks.In both cases, the properties will have to be optimized, through a higher and more homogeneous expression from the NAG-driven promoters and through the completion of the antifungal operons to produce more than two antifungal peptides.We were able to set up a model which mimics the cave s environment.Our aim is to reinforce the natural predation capacity of B. subtilis and to ensure it is expressed independantly of the conditions.An explanation to our problems could be that SDP and SKF cloning in E. coli results in the bacterium death.The late expression could mean that the formulation of our minimal medium is not optimal.The fact that the pNagA-RFP and pNagP-RFP strains seem able to slightly express the RFP on glucose (figure 7B, left panel close-up), albeit on weaker extend that on NAG (figure 7B, right panel close-up), could be due to the alleviating of the catabolic repression.The constructions with the RFP reporter gene were ordered from IDT and successfully sub-cloned in the pSB1C3 (new parts BBa_K1937003 and BBa_K1937005 ; figure 6).We tested different fungi (Aspergillus niger, Talaromyces funiculosus and Chaetomium globosum) but we eventually focussed on Talaromyces funiculosus that seems easier to manipulate to us.Our test consisted in adding, on fungi inoculated plates, paper patches soaked with either copper sulfate (positive control), LB medium (negative control), a suspension of Bacillus subtilis WT or Bacillus subtilis expressing the antifungal AF_A operon (figure 8).These observations allow us to conclude that AF_A is functional.As our therapeutic bacterium was supposed to treat fungi growing on the walls of a cave, we needed to test its activity in conditions that would mimic the cave\x92s environment.However, we never managed to get the MazE/Zeta construction in the pSB1C3 backbone.We had thought about this problem, but we had believed the expression driven by the pVeg Bacillus promoter to be insufficient for such effect.From there, our strategy was to do Gibson cloning to obtain the full operon in pSB1C3 in E. coli and then to transfer it in B. subtilis.We hypothesize that one of the peptide could be toxic for E. coli.Thanks to it, we got encouraging results showing that the therapeutic agent might be functional.Here, we fashioned a genetic system to prevent horizontal transfer of our synthetic constructions.As the later one contained our therapeutic agent, this observation suggested that our modified bacterium might be active against the fungi.The red color of the spots was due to ochre, whose purpose was to mimic the frescoes of the cave (See Figure below).Sub-cloning of the first operon (containing cut version of the Metchnikowin and D4E1) on the pSB1C3 backbone was rapidly performed, leading to the new composite part BBa_K1937007 (pSB1C3-AF_A).The sequence were optimized for the Bacillus codon usage and to remove inadequate restriction sites.However, the absence of growth on Spot 7 would argue against this conclusion.', 'safety': 'This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.We have to apply the basic safety principles in all laboratory rooms:- It is forbidden to drink and eat in the laboratory rooms.- It is compulsory to wear a closed lab coat in cotton.- Oral pipetting of any substance is prohibited in any laboratory.There are also others precautions when working with biological organisms:- It is compulsory to wear gloves except for the use of an electric burner.- In some cases (UV light, projection risk), it is compulsory to wear protection glasses.- Equipments: As soon as we manipulate in the lab, we have to wear the following personal protective equipments (a conventional lab coat, closed with long sleeves, closed shoes, gloves, glasses if needed).A specific trash can is dedicated to gloves or paper and another is dedicated to the agarose gels that were contaminated.- Chemical hood: We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous

Legislation and French Labor Law: We work in a public school for engineers (INSA Toulouse), thus we have to respect the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms.Abstract: In the lab, we have to respect numerous safety regulations for the security and health of others and the environment.As we work with microorganisms and cell cultures, we are concerned by the regulation on workers\x92 protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No.First of all, we have designed a physical device that would confine our engineered bacteria to the area to be treated (see the device part).However, when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the public and the environment.We have used E. coli and B. subtilis chassis, since their genomes are very well characterized and, of course, since these bacteria are non-pathogenic.Moreover, the French regulation does not allow any genetically modified microorganisms to be taken outside the lab.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)No.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)No.(However,

caves and the surrounding environment.That\x92s why, to minimize both the risk of dissemination and of gene transfer, several solutions were planned.Thanks to her, we have completed a formation (with the NEO software) to learn the different risks related to our work in the laboratory and how to react in case of danger.We have to obey to the rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (Decree No.- Waste: Different trash containers are available in the lab:- One for biological waste.This room is key-closed and the wearing of a lab coat, gloves and

implosive dangers of the dispositive and the security measures to take in order to protect oneself.- Biological safety cabinet: To work into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms, we have used a biological safety cabinet (FASTER \x96 Ultrasafe).Their goal is to ensure the well-being of the employees, regarding safety rules and risk prevention.A lab coat, heat resistant gloves and glasses were required for the manipulation of the autoclave.During summer, our team worked in the engineering school INSA, which has a safety department.(However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.)This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5).Therefore, the main threat is the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where gene transfer could occur between microorganisms.In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures.This Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive

the pSEVA plasmids and information regarding genetic engineering of P.putida KT 2440  Prof. Ohad Medalia, Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich, Switzerland.', 'background': '', 'description': 'bacteria that is able to respire its excess electrons through electrodes),  and since PET is a polymer that contains a large amount of energy in its carbon-carbon bonds,  excess energy released by our engineered P. putida from terephthalate degradation will be harnessed and utilized in a microbial fuel cell (MFC),  leading to an efficient and energy producing, rather than consuming, degradation of PET.In order to achieve symbiosis between our two chosen bacterial species we have separated them using a dialysis membrane so that the E. coli, secreting the LC-Cutinase and utilizing ethylene glycol is enclosed and separated from the P. putida which is utilizing the terephthalic acid that diffuses out of the dialysis bag.Their mutual dependence depends on the fact that terephthalate will be the sole carbon source for P. putida s growth, and cannot be generated in the absence of E. coli secreting LC-cutinase, while E. coli will not survive in elevated levels of terephthalate, that has to be degraded by P. putida, thus engineering a symbiotic dependence between the two bacterial species.Our goal is to genetically engineer P. putida so it will contain two plasmids which will encode for two essential components: a membrane transporter that will carry the terephthalate molecule into the cell and the necessary genes for its degradation.We plan to insert a degradation pathway for terephthalate into P. putida using genetic engineering, while the other monomer of PET, ethylene glycol, is utilized by E. coli that secretes our improved LC-Cutinase protein.The terephthalate degradation pathway, derived from a strain of Commamonas testosteroni , terminates in protocatechuate, a toxic molecule for most bacteria, however, P. putida, is able to utilize it as a carbon source for its growth (Jimenez et al 2002).LC-Cutinase is an enzyme discovered from an unknown organism in leaf-branch compost, and has been found to be one of the most efficient enzymes in breaking down PET polymers with relatively high crystallinity into degradable products, the monomers ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.This way, we hope to achieve a full degradation of the two PET products and with it to drive the PET biocatalysis reaction by LC-Cutinase forward.This energy can be utilized in a future device for the maintenance of growth conditions or the pretreatment of PET to render it easily degraded by the engineered bacteria.We have chosen to work with P. putida, which is a gram-negative bacterium, for its diverse metabolism, including the ability to degrade organic solvents, especially protocatechuate, a toxic substance for most bacteria, its similarity to E. coli in most laboratory protocols and its electrochemical properties which allow it to be used in our fuel cell.Based on the LC-Cutinase structure that was solved in 2014 (Sulaiman et al 2014), we have chosen to use a rational mutagenesis approach for its improvement.We decided to achieve this by genetic engineering of metabolic pathways of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida (P. putida).The ethylene glycol degradation pathway, present in our chosen E. coli strain, BL-21, supplies a carbon source for its growth while degrading PET to its respective monomers with LC-Cutinase.The two bacteria will metabolize the two PET degradation products - leading to the conversion of PET to CO2.In addition, current solutions for the disposal of PET, such as recycling and burying are also energy consuming as they require means such as transportation,  sorting and initial processing.Many ideas were considered in dealing with plastic waste such as burning plastic or burying it, but these solutions are considered damaging to the environment due to plastics toxicity.In addition, the pelB leader sequence was fused to the enzyme in its N terminus and was expressed and secreted to the growth media of E. coli.Next, we wanted to fully degrade the resulting monomers to CO2, this way no toxic molecules will remain as products of the degradation process.With the advancements made in the field of polymer chemistry during the 20th century,  many new polymers were introduced into industry and are known to us today as Polystyrene, Polyethylene and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET).Since the introduction of plastics, some microbial communities or species have evolved to successfully degrade plastics, however,  from an evolutionary point of view, probably due to the relatively short period of exposure to plastics,  they are yet to be efficient in plastic biodegradation.However, one of its best features was found to be one of its greatest drawbacks, the durability of plastic makes it virtually non-degradable.Using this approach, we made various mutations using an algorithm developed by Dr. Sarel Fleishman of the Weizmann Institute of Science (Goldenzweig et al.In order to offer a better alternative to the existing solutions we decided to explore options which would allow us to maintain a positive energy balance.Our goal as the Ben-Gurion University IGEM team of 2016 is to overcome this evolutionary hurdle by devising several approaches using synthetic biology tools for efficient plastic biodegradation.Genomic analysis of the aromatic catabolic pathways from Pseudomonas putida KT2440.', 'design': 'To provide us with a versatile vector, that will allow excision of a specific sequence from the designed insert if needed,  we added a restriction site between each element (gene or RBS).M259F - A \x91hole\x92 inside the protein core could be destabilizing to the protein structure.E. coli strain MG1655 was used for cloning of the LC-Cutinase genes into the pACYC vector backbone.Our chosen approach utilized a dialysis membrane with a cut-off of 12-14kDa, which is lower than LC-Cutinase s molecular mass, to enable the diffusion of the PET degradation products outside the bag for utilization by P. putida, while enabling a large concentration of LC-Cutinase inside the bag for efficient degradation of PET.Here are a few examples of mutations present in our mutated variants: A249P - Proline (shown in yellow) is added to increase the rigidity of the protein structure.Based on the structure of LC-Cutinase, we decided to use a rational mutagenesis approach, in which we introduce various mutations to the enzyme s sequence.In order to build a self-sustaining system in which part of the energy from PET could be utilized to make clean energy, we  We chose a bacterium that is proven to be electrochemically active (Timur et al 2007).The mutations were designed using the PROSS (Protein Repair One Stop Shop) algorithm, developed by the Fleishman Lab from the Weizmann Institute (Goldenzweig et al 2016).S257A - Polar side groups, such as a hydroxyl in Serine, with no hydrogen bonds, are destabilizing as the protein core should be hydrophobic.Two vectors for cloning were chosen and ordered from the Standard European Vector  Architecture\x92s (SEVA) collection.The wild type LC-Cutinase gene with the pelB leader sequence was obtained from the UC-Davis 2012 iGEM team (Part:BBa_K936013) and was amplified using primers containing restriction sites that match the pACYC backbone.Shredded PET was added to the dialysis bag and a magnetic stirrer was used to prevent precipitation.The algorithm uses the following steps in selecting the mutations: A sequence alignment was generated between the target wild-type sequence and other homologous sequences, from which several mutations were chosen.The restriction site had to be unique to avoid digestion of the genes or the vector backbone.Flanking each insert we designed and added homologous sequences to the desired target vector (224 or 434), for cloning with the NEBuilder® HiFi  DNA Assembly Cloning Kit.The flanking sequences also contained restriction sites for cloning into the multiple cloning site(MCS) of each vector.The mediator\x92s formal potential should be adequate to the enzyme potential.We decided to use protocatechuic acid as it is part of the terephthalate metabolic pathway, which enables us to reduce the use of external reagents and to create a self-sustaining system.Containing 3 genes from C. testosteroni strain KF-1 for the transport of Terephthalic acid from the periplasmic  The genes involved in the Terephthalate degradation pathway and transporter were acquired from the Darmstadt iGEM team, 2012.Each mutant\x92s structure was compared to the wild-type structure,  and the energy difference between them was calculated (??Gcalc).Containing 4 genes from the same strain of C. testosteroni for the degradation of Terephthalic acid to Protocatechuic acid \x96 tphA1, tphA2, tphA3, tphB.At first, we examined the possibility of adding an electron carrier to the fuel cell,  as it was shown to be effective in enhancing the MFCs performance and was demonstrated using this species.We have chosen the pSEVA plasmids because they have been previously used in the P. putida KT2440 strain by the laboratory of Prof. D. Taufik at the Weizmann Institute.', 'human_practice': 'As an initial step to solve the plastic waste problem, we read the literature, learned what have already been done and met with several experts in different aspects of plastic waste:Prof. Alex Sivan, a scientist from the Ben-Gurion University who is an expert in microbial degradation of plastic waste.After learning about the LC-Cutinase, and making a comprehensive research about its properties we decided to focus on improving its PET degrading activity.Next, we consulted Dr. Sarel Fleishman, a scientist from Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, who is expert in computational protein design to improve enzyme activity.Finally, we aimed to learn about the current solutions for plastic waste.With the acquired knowledge, the magnitude of damage of plastic waste, and it became clear to us that we must find an effective and fast solution to deal with this problem.We also contacted Prof. Dan Tawfik and Dr. Halim Jubran from the Department of Bimolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, who provided the P. Putida KT 2440.In addition we met Prof. Amir Aharoni and Dr. Shimon Bershtein, two scientists from our university who are expert in protein engineering who study and improve complex biological processes.By visiting at Aviv recycling company, we saw and learned the process of plastic recycling \x96 from the arrival of the plastic bottle to the plant to its reduction into raw plastic material made for the creation of other products.Finally, we discussed our plan and the project s design with our PIs concluding the valuable information to start wet lab work on our project.Furthermore, we done a comprehensive investigation of plastic s implications in order to learn and be able to raise awareness of the plastic hazard.Throughout the project, we met experts from the industry who utilize plastic in its raw state - Coca-Cola Company, Genome compiler and many more.We have learned about plastic s convenient properties such as flexibility, rigidity and lucidity that make plastic a popular raw material in the industry.Discovering that the current recycling process produces plastic waste that is not recyclable was eye opener, as it emphasizes the unmet need for biodegradation of plastic waste.One of the most interesting and important things we have learned is that 99% of the recycled raw plastic material is being used for products that cannot be recycled again.We consulted Prof. Sivan about our approach to a new solution for plastic degradation and learned that LC-Cutinase is an enzyme that is known for his ability to break PET bonds into two monomers: ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': 'The results show significant raising in the absorption but we didn\x92t succeed to detect the TPA.The reasons why we didn\x92t succeed to detect TPA

containing PET and E. coli using fluorescence The bacterium Rhodococcus ruber R. ruber, known to utilize polyethylene (PE) as a carbon source, was grown in various liquid growth media with and without amino-acids and containing PE or PET pellets for a period of 30 days.Examining the utilization of PET by E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase In order to test the PET degradation ability of the LC-Cutinase enzyme variants, all variants were grown on M9 minimal medium plates with shredded PET pellets as a sole carbon source to test their ability to degrade PET.As seen from the results, our E. coli was able to grow with only PET as a sole carbon source, suggesting it utilized PET s degradation product, ethylene glycol, as a carbon source.(for detailed instructions on the preparation of the media see Protocols).Figure 28: E. coli expressing the codon-optimized(CO) LC-Cutinase grown on a M9 soft agar plate with shredded PET pellets as a sole carbon source.As seen from the images, the surface of the PET pellets is relatively smooth, there are some high crystallinity rod shaped structures but they are fairly covered.Figure 20: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days

from the image, both samples show growth, corresponding to P. putida s endogenic resistance and E. coli s plasmid acquired resistance to Chloramphenicol.Figure 42: Plate number 2 - samples grown on a

P. putida with the same apparatus.We performed SEM on the PET samples in order to examine if the same effect on the polymer s surface is observed:Figure 7: A scanning electron microscope image of an

glucose, glucose and amino-acids and a SM medium with no carbon source (for detailed instructions on preparation of the media see Protocols ).Figure 1: R. ruber grown on SM liquid media with various carbon sources for a period of 30 days.As seen in the images above, all LC-Cutinase variants were able to grow on the plates containing shredded PET, suggesting that the PET is degraded and E. coli is utilizing at least one of its products (we assume - ethylene glycol).The media containing plastic as the sole carbon source (PET, PE), reached higher O.D600 values from that of a medium with no carbon source (SM medium) but lower O.D600 than on glucose media or plastic enriched with AA media.Figure 32: E. coli expressing the R7 LC-Cutinase variant grown on a M9 soft agar plate with shredded PET

results when the bacterium was grown on media containing amino acids (AA), suggesting the bacteria can utilize the AA as a carbon source.X1000 magnification.Figure 23: A scanning electron microscope

planktonic form in the media.Figure 4: An image taken with a Phase-contrast microscope from SM media with PET after incubation with R. ruber.Characterization of the co-culturing of E. coli and P. putida separated by a dialysis bag - a controlled symbiotic approach.More samples from the same experiment were analyzed using SEM:Figure 5: A scanning electron microscope image of an untreated PE pellet in a X1000 magnification.Figure 6: A scanning electron microscope image of a PE pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X1000 magnification.For control, TPA presence was detected in plates containing E. coli transformed with an empty vector plasmid (the same vector used for expression of LC-Cutinase), and no bacteria at all.As proof of concept in the biofuel part of our project, Our test results may suggest that there is a potential in constructing a biofuel cell based on the electrochemical activity of P. putida KT 2440 with protocatechuic acid as an electron mediator.If our speculation was correct, the LC-Cutinase was supposed to be expressed from the E. coli, degrade the PET, and the bacterium could consume ethylene glycol from the degradation products.Here are the results of E. coli strain BL21 s growth with liquid M9 media containing ethylene glycol as a sole carbon source:Figure 27: E. coli strain BL21 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of EG for a period of 96 hours.That can be explained by the preferential degradation of the amorphous material exposing the better defined (higher crystallinity) material that goes through a slower degradation (Shah et al 2008).Figure 9: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.Figure 10: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.Figure 11: A scanning electron microscope image of a PET pellet after 30 days of incubation with R. ruber in a X2,500 magnification.In order to assess the ability of our two chosen bacterial species - E. coli and P. putida to grow in symbiosis, a key element in our project s design, we cultivated both bacteria in a liquid LB medium, separated by a dialysis bag.Even though later tests with R. ruber show that the concentration of enzyme is an important part in efficiency of degradation,  we still decided to run these tests again, with equal enzyme concentrations on our 2 fastest variants - CO and F4:Figure 15: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of 3 LC-Cutinase variants - CO, F4 and the W.T., at a substrate concentration of 125?M.Looking at the entire design- our biofuel cell will consist of E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase that degrades the PET and consumes ethylene glycol (it includes the previous results in the E. coli ethylene glycol utilization results).In contrast, our results show no growth with TPA, which lead us to the conclusion that P. putida cannot utilize it as a sole carbon source.This experiment, although it cannot quantify the degradation efficiency, is another indication of the existence and activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme, and the ability of E. coli expressing our LC-Cutinase to utilize its degradation product- ethylene glycole.However, we have clearly shown that our bacteria can utilize PET as a carbon source using the LC-Cutinase protein, which is a proof-of-concept for one part of our project.Figure 44: PET plates (prepared as previously described in the PET Utilization experiment (Experiments Page), after colony growth, were exposed to UV light (as described in the Terephthalic acid detection assay (Experiments Page)), then tested in a fluorescence gel imager to detect TPA presence by excitation in 314nm end detecting emission at 426nm.We took samples from both PET and PE media (with pellets) and examined them with a Phase-contrast microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM):Figure 3: An image taken with a Phase-contrast microscope from SM media with PET after incubation with R. ruber.We can conclude from these results that our E. coli strain BL21, like other E. coli strains, can utilize EG as a sole carbon source, with an optimal concentration of 30mM.X1000 magnification.Figure 18: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days of incubation in a liquid LB broth with no bacteria.X1000 magnification.Figure 17: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PET pellet after 2 days of incubation in a liquid LB broth with no bacteria.It should be mentioned that protocatechuic acid polymerizes in the presence of amine groups, a reaction that could interfere with the electron transfer, hence other more potent mediators will be explored including the operation of the biofuel cell without mediators, since P. putida are reported to produce their endogenous electron transfer mediators.We have demonstrated that creating a biofilm on a graphite anode can be easily done, making this part of our system applicable.As seen above, after incubation with the LC-Cutinase expressing bacteria, the surface of the PET is rougher than the control.X2500

Colony-PCR results used to the detect the presence of the aldA gene(1440bp) from E. coli shown on 1% agarose gel.Samples were left to incubate unopened for 3 months to test for the formation of biofilms.Figure 2: R. ruber biofilm formation on a PE pellet.In this experiment we grew E. coli strain BL-21 transformed with the pACYC vector containing the LC-Cutinase W.T.We have witnessed similar results with PET pellets, suggesting R. ruber can also utilize PET as a sole carbon source.As shown, plates containing E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase showed higher emission levels, which indicates of higher presence of TPA in the plates in question.Moreover, we see that E. coli remained viable throughout the experiment, verifying our hypothesis that it can grow inside a dialysis bag, and suggesting that our symbiotic design using a dialysis bag is plausible.We consider that result as an important step and a proof-of-concept of our final goal.gene grown in liquid M9 media with PET as a sole carbon source.Moreover, when comparing the bacteria expressing the LC-Cutinase gene and the bacteria transformed with an empty vector backbone, we see a clear difference in the texture of the PET.One method to assess the activity of our designed mutants was using the pNP-butyrate (pNP-B) degradation assay We ran the tests on all 5 variants of the LC-Cutinase protein with different concentrations of the substrate: Figure 12: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.It is important to note, that to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PET degradation by R. ruber is reported.We assume that this is the result of the PET degradation activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme.Those results are a consequence of a rupture in the dialysis membrane which occurred during the experiment.Reviewing these results leads us to the conclusion that the TPA degradation pathway must be cloned into the P. putida bacterium for efficient PET degradation.In order to test P. putida s ability to utilize TPA and PCA as a carbon source we measured O.D610 values for a period of ~100 hours with P. putida in liquid M9 media with either TPA or PCA as a carbon source.As seen from these results, all of our variants, including the codon-optimized Cutinase, have shown increased pNP-B degradation activity compared to the W.T.From these results we conclude that P. putida can utilize PCA as a sole carbon source, as previously reported.As seen from the results above, both bacteria maintained viability using our dialysis bag apparatus during the experiment.Samples taken from plates 1,3,6,7 and 10 were positive, suggesting they contained E. coli.Figure 41: Plate number 1 - samples taken from inside and outside the dialysis bag and grown over-night on a petri dish containing Chloramphenicol.As seen from the image, both samples show growth, suggesting that both samples contain P. putida, which has endogenic resistance to Ampicillin.It should be mentioned that it is not yet established that R. ruber is able to utilize PET as a carbon source.We have managed to show that out E. coli will be able to break down PET in conditions similar to those in our designed biofuel cell and to survive without any other carbon source.Controls are the same as with 50?M concentration.Figure 14: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.Contrary to our expectations, the untreated PET surface is smooth while the treated sample\x92s surface seemed to have gone through degradation (fig.In the second day of measurements, there was a decline in power output probably due to cell death.As seen from the results, the Km values of our variants compared to the W.T.To prevent contamination, we used Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol (at 100?g/mL and 34.1?g/mL respectively) as selection markers.Figure 25: P. putida KT2440 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of PCA for a period of 96 hours.Please note, that when comparing the appearance of degraded PET between LC-Cutinase degraded PET and R. ruber degraded PET, they looked the  same, however, the difference was that it took a month to R. ruber to degrade PET to the observed picture (Fig.Moreover, our new LC-Cutinase genes consist of a PelB leader sequence that has been codon optimized to maximize expression levels in E. coli.5 and 10mM concentration were tested twice ("a/b").Figure 26: P. putida KT2440 grown in liquid M9 media with different concentrations of TCA for a period of 136 hours.LC-Cutinase grown on a M9 agar plate no carbon source.Detection of TPA in plates containing PET and E. coli using fluorescenceAfter seeing bacterial growth on our PET plates, we wanted to combine our protocols of PET utilization and to detect the presence of TPA in our plates.Again, we can see that the CO and F4 variants have higher activity in regards to pNP-B degradation than the W.T.Figure 39: Colony-PCR results used to the detect the presence of the pcaD gene(792bp) from P. putida shown on 1% agarose gel.As part of our work with the P. putida KT2440 strain we wanted to test its antibiotic resistances, so we can select the appropriate cloning vectors.We cannot conclude which variant degrades the PET with the highest efficiency, as the PET in the plates is not evenly spread and the amount of PET degraded cannot be measured in this assay.Calculating the values from the CV measurements we found that the substance had a middle point Potential of E0 = 174 mV vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.Figure 43: Plate number 4 - samples taken from inside and outside the dialysis bag and grown over-night on a petri dish containing Kanamycin.For control we used E. coli strain BL-21 without any vector ("BL-21") with pACYC plasmid backbone only ("pACYC").Figure 13: pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of all LC-Cutinase variants and W.T.That being said, more experiments are required in order to confirm our hypothesis and determine the proper concentrations of the protocatechuic acid and characterize the mechanisms with which it mediates P. putida s electron transfer.We also notice that the surface of the PET looks more porous and the rod shaped, high crystallinity PET, is more exposed than in the control.Which is an indication to the electroactivity of P. putida compared to control, with relatively high internal resistance.We can see a large increase in power output induced in the sample containing bacteria in the 250-500 mV range,  compared to the control.The internal resistance was measured in the first day with values of 60 ? for the cell containing bacteria and 1000 ? for the control.One control was PET pellets incubated for 2 days in LB liquid media with no bacteria.We speculated that in this case the EPS is used for the absorption of the PET micro particles and allows the accumulation of secreted enzymes.Moreover, when comparing the Kcat values of our variant to the W.T.Finally, we can see that the catalytic efficiency, portrayed by the Kcat/Km value, has been significantly improved in our variants, compared to the W.T.As seen from the image, no growth is visible in either sample.It can be explained by the ability of bacteria, i.e.', 'safety': '"Synthetic biology is a relatively new science with tremendous potential to change how we view and know the life science,  but like many developing technologies, it has provoked ethical concerns from the scientific community and the public and confronts demands for new regulatory measures".Humans are not seen as just another part of the ecosystem, so moral decisions about environmental issues have  After meeting Prof. Glick, we were eager to learn more about how Judaism deals ethical issues regarding scientific research and progress.We thought that as we modify organisms in our lab enabling them to preform new functions,  we should learn our limitations and the complexities are involved in synthetic biology.(For example, at times, it was necessary to work with a chemical like Catechol, or to handle EthidiumSafe Project Design (Safety Risks to the General Public): Our final goal as the BGU iGEM team is to create an operating biofuel cell, which will break down polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using E. coli and P. putida.Moreover, we use the P. putida KT2440 strain, which is the first  Gram-negative soil bacterium to be certified as a safety strain by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee  (Federal Register, 1982(3)) and is the preferred host for cloning and gene expression for Gram-negative soil  With the safety of the environment in mind, we designed a metabolic cascade to degrade the toxic intermediates in the PET degradation pathway, to non-toxic compounds that can be used by the bacterium for energy in the TCA cycle.Therefore, the genetic modification done on this  bacterium will be useless, since it is responsible for degrading TPA, which is a commodity chemical that usually  World Health Organization (WHO) \x96 Laboratory biosafety manual, third edition Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms: Israel Synthetic biology: a Jewish view.In his paper, "Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View\x94, Prof. Glick describes the Jewish approach towards scientific progress as well rounded and aware to the problems it presents: "Judaism traditionally looks favorably on man as a co-creator with God and encourages research for the benefit of humankind.All of our project s lab members received safety training by our advisors, and had to partake in a lab safety online  course offered by the Ben Gurion University safety department.In order to ensure the safety of our product, we integrated into our design the self-destruct mechanism developed by the 2013 Ben Gurion University iGEM team.During the summer, we met several experts from the bioethics field, who gave us general new ethical insights that might be First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science.Thus, we learned that ethical issues need to be considered in many  Second, we learned that our designed product is encountered with a relativity new term called genetically modified organism  (GMO).In recent years, effective biosafety laws and regulations have been adapted by several countries to prevent terrorists and  other hostile powers from obtaining dangerous biological agents, technologies, or information that would allow them to  In 2008, the Israeli parliament ("Kenesset") decided to tighten biosecurity measures and legislated the regulation of  research into biological disease agents law, which provides a legislative framework to conduct research involved biological  disease agents.Furthermore, ethic  issues might arise during the research process.These principals are much alike some aspects  Familiarizing with the GMO concept, we discovered that there is a discrepancy between the way the public perceive bioethics and the way it is studied and practiced.But, in the Jewish tradition man is also charged with stewardship over nature and  is admonished to preserve and nurture, not just to exploit and destroy".With this mechanism, not only the expression of our genes will be dependent on an IPTG inducer, but it will also force our E. coli to be fully dependent on an unnatural amino acid (UAA).In our project, we preformed multiple growth experiments using different intermediates in the PET degradation  pathway as carbon sources.Some of the chemicals have specific safety instructions according to their MSDS,  which were printed out and stored in the lab for all of the members to read and work according to.Synthetic biology promises significant advances in areas such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, agriculture, and medicine  Many concerns might stem from the field of synthetic biology.For instance, researchers confronts ethical questions regarding integrity, objectivity and authenticity during the research process.In the lab, we wear protective clothing and gloves at all times (unless working with fire).World-wide governments, including the federal regime in the USA, had a minor role in regulating and enforcing ethical  As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues.Many hold the view that  pollution is an insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care  for God s creation.Without supplying it to the bacteria medium, or in case of release to the environment (which will only happen by accident since we do not intend to release our bacteria), our E. coli bacteria will not survive.The Talmud which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, teaches  a basic ethical principle in Jewish law, the  Bal Tashchit  ("do not destroy") commend.Does a genetically modified organism can have a negatively effects on the environment or on human being?We found a quote from Rabi Moshe Ben Maimon (Maimonidas), a philosopher, scientist, polymath and one of the  most important adjudicators in the Jewish religion that lived in the Middle Ages :"If men possessed wisdom, which stands  in the same relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye, they would not cause any injury to themselves or to others, for the knowledge of the truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual injuries".The federal government in the USA and the European governments enforce all aspects regarding the research process, implementing rules and regulations.Third, we asked ourselves what is the potentially harmful consequences that may emerge when implementing new technology.We met with Prof. Shimon Glick from the  Faculty of Health Sciences (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be er-Sheva, Israel), an expert in the field of Jewish medical ethics.The law calls for the establishment of a council to regulate and monitor research on select infectious  disease agents.The federal government As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues.Our second bacterium, P. putida, which is design to consume TPA (one of the PET degradation products), would not be able to consume PET as it is dependent on LC-Cutinase (the enzyme which breaks the initial bond in the PET polymer into TPA and EG), since LC-Cutinase is expressed and secreted from E. coli.Such concerns  are also considered a biosafety matter as creating a GMO is accompanied with lots of uncertainties regarding its future effects on the environment.It also prescribes institutional committees with defined responsibilities and identifies means of control, Until the beginning of the 50 s there were no clear guide lines or standards for ethical behavior in conducting a research.Furthermore, GMOs is widely  We also learned that there are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, when a marked difference can be  found between the United states that favor for GMO products while Europe union is basically against.For example: Bacterium self - destruction switch mechanism that was developed by BGU iGEM Team 2013,  And allows to control the life time of the modified organism.Thus, the Jewish tradition would haves a positive attitude towards the current goals of synthetic biology.In the meeting Prof. Glick thought us about Jewish views of bioethics.In order to  enforce these regulations, government instructed the establishment of the Institutional Review Board (IRB).The lack of knowledge and the complexity of this field arise many  questions and concerns among the general public.(Prof. Bracha Rager-Zisman, Department of Microbiology  Immunology and Genetics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) .This way, the degradation process does not release any pollutants or toxins to the environment other than the  carbon dioxide and water bacteria produce in their own metabolic processes.The commend orders men not to waste or destroy our earth, the commend is invoked only for destruction that is deemed unnecessary.The Book of Genesis indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis emphasizes that the  role of people is to maintain and take care of the world.Shimon Glick describes several ethical issues related to Synthetic Biology from a  Jewish aspect in a paper he published a few years ago:\x94 Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View\x94 (1): Ethics raises many issues and controversy in science.However, humans are regarded as having a special place in the created order, and their well-being is  paramount.It indicates the need of finding a balance between the human s wellbeing and preserving the creation.IRB is an institute that exist in every academic establishment or research institute and function to implement

Kopa - Micha? was in charge of studying melibiose induced and T7 promoters.', 'background': '', 'description': '', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': 'We also eliminated potential secondary structures, that could mask RBS.Steps of the assembly: amplification with specially designed primers that add overlaps, the assembly with CPEC reaction, purification and bacteria transformation.We picked the best colonies and inoculated them on M9 minimal medium with 0,4% of glucose (control) and melibiose (inducer).Melibiose promoters are working- they are induced by melibiose, and there is no expression on glucose.Once again (third time) we inoculated proC, proC with thermo and proD into 250?l M9 with 0,5% of different sugars in 5ml Eppendorf tubes.The fluorescence of all the samples was measured using Denovix (see Methods).AraWT, Arashort1 and Arashort2 on M9 with: 0,5% arabinose, 0,25%arabinose + 0,25% glucose (to check how much glucose stops the expression of sfGFP under arabinose promoters); for the culture in M9 with sugar combinations we prepared 3 samples; proRha1 (without EcoRI) and Rha2 on M9 with: 0,5% rhamnose, 0,25% rhamnose + 0,25% glucose (to check how much glucose stops the expression of sfGFP under rhamnose promoters); for the culture in M9 with sugar combinations we prepared 3 samples.We inoculated XylWT and XylA1 into overnight liquid LB medium, so that we can make stocks the next day.Then we checked the assembly of the promoter during sequencing \x96 the construct was assembled in a proper way.We also prepared M9 minimum media with 0,1%, 0,25%, 0,01%, 1% and 0,5% of different sugars: arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, melibiose.These are the results under UV light:XylS is much stronger than XylF, and 0,25% of xylose in M9 medium is enough for a good expression in longer (44,5h in this example) culture.We also checked Arashort1 and Arashort2 on M9 medium with 0,01%, 0,1%, 0,25%, 0,5% and 1% of arabinose (44,5h, 37°C): And RhaWT and Rha without EcoRI - 0,01%, 0,1%, 0,25%, 0,5%, 1% of arabinose (44,5h, 37°C): The fluorescence of all the previous samples was measured using Denovix (see Methods).We prepared bacterial glycerol stocks with RhaWT, proRha1 without EcoRI, proRha2, AraWT, Arashort1, Arashort2, XylS, XylF and proD.(See Methods)So as we can see in the picture, our proRha1 is acting in a good way- it is induced by rhamnose (left) and the colonies don\x92t produce fluorescent sfGFP on different carbon source- glucose.We picked the best colonies from proRha1 and proD and inoculated the overnight liquid LB with them in order to multiply bacteria that took up plasmid.The possible reason of that is the falsity of NanoDrop - maybe we didn t use enough amount of different elements.We tried to perform the assembly of our first constructs one more time using CPEC, but this time we used two times more nanograms of elements then last time.We also prepared fragments for our next construct: proD-sfGFP, which is an isolated, constitutive promoter; we amplified proD and sfGFP-D- with overlaps for each other and with overlaps for plasmid.We performed the elution of proD and sfGFPD.We also used AraGFP-WT as a control.We inoculated some of the colonies on the M9 minimal medium with agarose/glucose to investigate how those promoters work.This is Arashort1 on arabinose (left) and on glucose (right; negative control).Then we diluted them and use as a template in a reamplification with primers that add overlaps:We performed elution of the desired agarose bands- everything went well and now we have fragments for the assembly with plasmid.We also precipitated constructs from our last CPEC (Arashort1 and proRha1 without EcoRI).We performed CPEC for proD-sfGFPD construct.We inoculated some of the colonies into M9 medium with glucose as a control (left) and with rhamnose for the induction (right):As it is seen on the picture, proRha2 is not as strong as RhaWT or proRha1 without EcoRI.After electroporation and incubation in 37°C we inoculated bacteria on Petri dishes.Unfortunately, there was nothing on those plates the next day- bacteria didn t grow.We performed CPEC for Arashort1 and Arashort2 one more time- we used more nanograms of different fragments (we started to think that NanoDrop is \x93lying\x94 and it overstates the results- it s telling us that the sample has more DNA, than it has in the reality).That s how they looked on minimum media- XylF is pretty weak- again glucose on the left and xylose on the right:We inoculated XylS and XylF on M9 minimum medium with 0,01%, 0,1%, 0,25%, 0,5% and 1% of xylose and incubated the culture for 44,5h in 37°C.XylS-sfGFP - a shortened form of the XylA1 promoter, since we have expected that catabolic repression should be weakened to enable the efficient induction of this promoter on standard media like LB.XylF-sfGFP - a DNA fragment containing only the XylF promoter with the original UTR of XylF gene upstream the sfGFP ORF.After reamplification of fragments with overlaps, we performed CPEC, purification of the product, and electroporation.After transformation with XylF we obtain only 3 colonies.And, as you can see, the induction occurs only in a presence of arabinose:We had our proC_thermometer construct on two Petri dishes with M9 medium with glucose- we put one in 37°C and second in 23°C.We tried to check, whether it is better to isolate them with isopropanol or ethanol.We found out that it is better to use isopropanol- on the gel, samples that were treated with isopropanol show no contamination of small RNAs (samples in the boxes- picture), whilst samples after ethanol have those low bands that represent those RNAs (=contamination).After sequencing our plasmids, we found out that constructs were assembled in a proper way, which is a very good news.After CPEC we purified constructs and completed electroporation with DH5?.We inoculated some colonies on M9 minimal medium with arabinose and with glucose (as a negative control).They started to show fluorescence on plates with arabinose, because it is required for the induction of expression in arabinose promoters.We inoculated some colonies from plates with arabinose into the overnight liquid LB medium.Once again we put bacteria with proC promoter into M9 medium with different sugars (0,5%), we also checked proC with thermometer and proD in that way.After PCR, we performed electrophoresis and elution of the desired bands:We performed CPEC reaction for the assembly of Arashort2 (Arashort2 + pSB1C3) and Arashort1 (Arashort1 + pSB1C3).We centrifuged the culture, resuspend the pellet in Mili Q water and put probes into a freezer.We think that those weights are so little, that there is no sense in measuring the weight in future experiments carried in 2/5ml tubes, cause it is really easy to make a mistake, and obtain false data.We performed the assembly of XylWT-sfGFP promoter, which is a promoter induced by xylose (we added sfGFP to it) and is present in E.coli.We performed CPEC reaction with our amplified fragments from previous week- CPEC is a circular polymerase extension cloning; the combining of different elements is possible thanks to overlaps (see Methods).The rule is, that one should take ten times less ng of template than it has base pairs- e.g.So we have to repeat it, starting from the beginning.We started amplifying fragments (with specially designed primers of course) for the next attempt for the Arashort1 assembly (let s hope that this time it will have sfGFP protein!).On Tecan we also measured 8h-cultures of arabinose and rhamnose promoters from last week.In order to compare our promoters with pET system (that uses T7 polymerase) we inoculated all of them into M9 with 0,5% of glucose.We picked single colonies and checked them on plates with M9 medium with 0,4% of rhamnose (which is an inducer) and with 0,4% of glucose (as a negative control)- bacteria on M9 with rhamnose should demonstrate fluorescency under UV light, because of sfGFP expression- proRha1 is induced by rhamnose.We purified constructs after CPEC (Arashort1 and Arashort2) and performed bacteria transformation- we also used AraGFP-WT construct as a control to check, whether our competent bacteria are not defective.The transformation was successful- bacteria grew on all the plates.We started to wonder, whether our fragments were amplified with proper primers, so we performed amplification of all fragments once again, just to be sure.We also amplified proC (which is an isolated, constitutive promoter, just like proD; they differ from each other only in one nucleotide) and proC with a thermometer (a hairpin at its 5 UTR) and sfGFP for them.(See Methods)We prepared cultures with bacteria that carry desired constructs in liquid LB medium, so that we can use them to inoculate M9 media the next day.That s a lot of tubes to label!The samples were incubating in 37°C for 24h, next we centrifuged them, resuspend the pellet in 100?l of water and measured them on Tecan fluorometer (using special 96-well plate; see Methods).After that we picked the best colonies from the plates and inoculated them into overnight LB liquid medium.We inoculated all of our promoters into M9 with all sugars (0,5%), in order to check, if they are tight (so the expression is only on their inducers, not on other carbon sources), or if they tend to leak.After that we performed plasmid isolation (see Methods).After sequencing: proC looks good, but Arashort1 doesn t- in a mysterious way we assembled it with Glo protein, not with sfGFP.We checked it by sequencing- they were assembled in a good way.We started amplifying fragments for the new construct- proRha2- which is a promoter induced by ramnose, but shorter- we will try to cut out the site responsible for catabolic repression.In order to start the culture we inoculated M9 media with the proper amount of bacteria, so that the final OD600 was about 0,1.After that, we performed plasmid isolation (see Methods).We centrifuged the cultures, resuspened the pellet in LB liquid medium, added glycerol (final concentration: 7%) and the antibiotic (chloramphenicol).Mel2-sfGFP- which is a shortened version; without PstI site (biobrick standards) and with changed 5 UTR- we exchanged it on 5 UTR that comes from the rhamnose promoter, it should position RBS element better.We also started amplification of fragments for Arashort2 (shorter arabinose promoter, without elements responsible for catabolic repression).XylWT: XylF-XylAwt-sfGFP - contains both promoters (xylA and F) oriented in the direction in which sfGFP expression is driven by the original xylA promoter copied from Escherichia coli genome.XylA1: XylF-XylA1-sfGFP containing both promoters oriented in the direction in which sfGFP expression is driven by xylA promoter , the 5 UTR has been modified to make it similar to RBS from a proD.add more GC pairs).We picked the best colonies from Arashort1 and proC and inoculated the overnight liquid LB with them in order to multiply bacteria that took up plasmid.We also made M9 minimum media with: 0,5% of xylose, 0,25% of xylose, 0,5% of arabinose, 0,5% of glucose, 0,5% of rhamnose.We were hoping that low temperature will stop the induction in this construct because of hairpin, that we created in the 5 UTR.We put stocks prepared in that way into the freezer (-20°C).Using specially designed primers and Rha-sfGFP-WT promoter as a template, we were able to amplify shorter version- proRha2-sfGFP.Those two bands represent shorter proRha2 with sfGFP.We purified it after the reaction and put it in the freezer (-20°C).We transformed DH5? using electroporation with Arashort1 and Arashort2 (see Methods).After inoculation we collected samples from all the cultures every 1hour, 8 times (so all the cultures lasted 8 hours) + one sample from 0h (to measure fluorescence at the beginning of the culture).We picked some colonies, inoculated them into liquid LB medium and performed plasmid isolation.We found out, that T7 (that should be induced by lactose/IPTG) shows sfGFP expression on a high level on all carbon sources, whilst our promoters are tight.', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'U n k n o w n', 'track': 'Manufacturing', 'part_favorite': 'BBa_K1741005', 'part_normal': 'BBa_K1741000\nBBa_K1741002\nBBa_K1741003\nBBa_K1741004\nBBa_K1741006\nBBa_K1741007\nBBa_K1741008\nBBa_K1741009\nBBa_K1741010\nBBa_K1741011\nBBa_K1741012\nBBa_K1741013\nBBa_K1741014', 'theme': '180', 'hits': 0}}, {'_index': 'team_wiki', '_type': 'wiki', '_id': 'AV3_VIO_r5lUclF2BU3O', '_score': 0.41222933, '_source': {'year': '2015', 'team_name': 'SCUT', 'attribution': 'clarified division and efficient cooperation,\xa0they sophisticatedly design uniforms and posters for the IGEM.in the previous iGEM work of Team EPF-Lausanne 2008 and Team UC Davis 2013 respectively.', 'background': 'As described above, our super cadmium ion killer system is efficient, economical and real-time monitoring, which has great potential application value in the treatment of cadmium pollution in the environment.Figure 7: Super cadmium ion killer adsorbing process.Detection of cadmium ion presence in the sewage and indication the concentration with various colors form the first part of the super killer system.With the presence of cadmium ion, the organism expresses CsgA-ECs to adsorb the ion and turns red from dark green.Expression of CsgA-ECs coupled to the sensor for cadmium ion forms the second part of the super killer system.MerR binds cadmium ion, when it presences in the culture.Therefore, it is especially important to eliminate cadmium pollution on the environment; this is the fundamental measure to prevent the occurrence of pain!Concerning cadmium pollution, the iGEM team 2015 SCUT would like to present super cadmium ion killer, a bacterial platform designed to detect and adsorb the cadmium in sewage all over the world.On the contrary, the organism is on red alert with high concentration cadmium ion, producing a red fluorescent protein RFP as well as CsgA-EC(s) to adsorb the ion.Based on the features described above, our project aim at assemble a device for removing cadmium by fusing CsgA and ECs to achieve absorbing Cd2+ extracellularly.Now we know, the cause of the disease is cadmium poisoning.About twelve million glasses were recalled in the United States.Figure 4 ?The paintcoat of the glasses sold by McDonald were detected to contain cadmium elements.In 2012?the report from the environmental organization of Canada about Potential Damage of Heavy Metals in Cosmetics said, almost all of the tested cosmetics contain toxic substances, including cadmium.In June 2012?Shandong Province, Rizhao City inspection and Quarantine Bureau seized 24 tons of heavy sauries from Japan , whose Cd content exceeded the safety standard.Figure 5?Rizhao(China) inspection and quarantine bureau staff at the time of sampling inspection, found that cadmium content of these 24tons saury exceeded the safety standard.Since there is no effective treatment of Itai Itai disease, and cadmium stored in the body did not rule out in a safe and effective method.Even mild cadmium poisoning can cause lung and kidney damage, like toxic pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonia.Asia is the world s largest primary cadmium metal producing areas, mainly in China, South Korea, and Japan.The river that local people used for drinking and irrigating crops was polluted by the sewage, containing a large amount of cadmium.But industry that is related to cadmium is globally existed?Smelting, spraying, welding and casting bearing surface of cadmium?Stope?Rods in nuclear reactors?Neutron absorber?Electroplating factory, and so on.In June 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission confirmed that the glasses sold by McDonald were found to contain cadmium elements in the paintcoat, which could exude from the surface of the glasses.When our E.coli is in a certain condition of low cadmium ion concentration, only the green chromoprotein cjBlue will be expressed, leading to a color of dark green in culture.We employ E.coli superficial fiber curli protein\x97CsgA and synthetic phytochelatins (ECs) to form CsgA-ECs, which can effectively remove cadmium ion in wastewater.Up to now, in 2014, a village in Guangxi, China also has the occurrence of Itai-Itai disease.Figure 2: A child was moaning because the great pain caused by Itai-Itai disease.Cadmium\x92s entering human body can make it a huge loss of calcium in bones and trigger a series of damage, like osteoporosis, bone atrophy, joint pain and so on.', 'description': '', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'Another great pity is that crippled by our poor measuring apparatus, we merely did some preliminary data measurement and treatment.Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the color change and the capacity of cadmium adsorption of the whole system in different initial concentration of extracellular cadmium ion.Based on the strength of these two promotors, we built a mathematical model to predict the capacity of processing the cadmium ion.The core of Bio-effector is csgA-EC compound.We also built a model about that based on their chelating equilibrium constant and use it to do the same thing as last model we have talked about.However, not everything went well, because of the lack of time, we failed to knock out the gene of csgA of wild type on time, we could only gain our referential parameters from multitudinous literatures and establish a similar model.This kind of method leads a result that when the concentration of cadmium ion is below the low limit of detection, the system is blue, otherwise it\x92s red instead.We believe, by doing so, we may conform better to the meaning of synthetic biology.As was discussed before, there are two devices of our system, one was named bio-sensor and the other, of course, was named bio-effector.And here we will just briefly talk about them.The former also has two main parts: PcadA, which is the cadmium ion induced promotor; and Ptet, which is simply Tetracycline induced promoter.The whole system was the divided into two devices.In order to simulate how it worked and made it simple for us to evaluate the result, we strive vigorously to establish a precise mathematical model of the procedure.CsgA-EC, whose function is decreasing the concentration of cadmium ion by using chelation, is the unit of our E.coli\x92s curli.', 'notebook': 'Having finished this part ,we had time to give assistance to our partner , cooperation makes our team more united ,and we gained a lot of joy at the same time.Without the Cd2+ existence , Ptet didn\x92t resist the expression of cjblue ,and we can see blue fluorescence in bacterial colony.In this way we can distinguish the expression difference of E.coli under the condition of Cd2+ existence or not.Contents: Obtained Ptet and cjblue through PCR techniques,we digested Ptet and cjblue,they were assembled in plasmid pSB1c3.Notes: We found some problems at the beginning,we can\x92t get the Ptet due to the false we made in primer designing,we re-designed the primer and got the right gene successfully.Besides, during the recovery of PCR product,No plastic recycling caused empty PSB1C3,later then we change the way of recycling,this trouble was dealt smoothly.Conclusion: Moloecular construction of this part was relatively simple as last part.Although we met some problems ,we corrected them in time to make our plan developed,which was worth for us to feel happy,and it made us believe in ourselves that we could finish the project perfectly at the same time.Introduction: We built the pathway for Cd2+ ion to enter into the E.coli ,we had constructed parts as follow: Contents: PCR techniques, transformation of plasmid,constructed PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 on PSB1C3.2.Assembled PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 to the pSB1C3 with pSB1C3 on it.Note:we had some trouble on the way to get PcadA ?PJ23100?PJ23101?PJ23106 through PCR techniques, we can not obtain target gene from plasmid by PCR directly because these promoter were too short, so we adopted overlap PCR to get them.Later then,we successfully constructed :Conclusion: we managed this part of moloecular construction smoothly without too much problems,which made our experiment in an orderly manner.With the PcadA designed on the primer,we successfully constructed PcadA on CsgA-EC?0?1?2?3?5? The PcadA-CsgA-EC(0?1?2?3?5?were digested by restriction enzyme ,then they were loaded on the pSB1c3 which contain the gene of tetR-RFP-ter.During this part we met many kinds of problems so that we had spent many time but we can not improve the efficiency,which meant we had to reflect ourselves.During the month,we were trying to find out the reason why CsgA can\x92t fit PcadA successfully.We checked the correctness of gene,even we restarted from the first step,we gained nothing.As shown in figure, the protein MerR can repress PcadA with Cd2+ absence, which makes downstream gene TetRcan\x92t express so that it can\x92t repress Ptet.We started to do the PCR in order to get our targeted gene PcadA and CsgA-EC?we got the CsgA?EC0?from company?so EC would be link with CsgA during the PCR procession?EC?2?3?5?had to adopt two-round PCR due to their length.We got the Top10 strain to prepared for our experiment and we used restriction enzyme to digest single gene (tetR?RFP)on pSB1c3,and made a ligation with terminator.This year our project aims to dealing with heavy metal ion--Cd2+,considering about the amount of work, we divided our project into two parts: intracellular Cd2+concentration sensing signal circuit structure and extracellular surface adsorption.We obtained PcadA and CsgA ,we tried to link them,however,we found no colony on culture medium.At the same time, cjblue stop expressing with tetR\x92s expression so thatE.coli becomes red gradually.Up to now,all moloecular construction had been finished.We successfully constructed  Having finished moloecular construction we sped up composing our wiki,On the other hand we started to prepare posters and the presentation at the same time and detected parameters by modeling group to perfect our project.We repeated the transformation but found that the colony we transformed last week turned blue,which meant false positive colony grows faster than target colony.After we finished transformation and inoculated ,we sent our plasmids for sequencing,however ,nothing was found on pSB1c3.', 'protocol': 'Until the front of the dye into the separating gel, boost the voltage to 150V, until the bromphenol

fractures in the earth which allow pathways for natural gas to channel up to the drill site.They advocate that each person educate themselves on the local risks and benefits of fracking, and directed

of our integrase in tandem with the leakiness of the gate on a low copy plasmid we co-transformed the Bxb1 integrase behind the arabinose inducible promoter on a kanamycinbackbone with BBa_K1718005 (switch-LuxI-GFP) on 4C5.It was tested by growing cells in overnight cultures with varying concentrations of arabinose, from 0% to .2%increasing by .04% for a total of 6 cultures.To characterize and test the leakiness of the LuxPr promoter, we created a construct that placed the LuxPr promoter in front of RFP on a 1C3 backbone.To further characterize this observation, we grew up overnights with varying concentrations of arabinose and measured their fluorescence.Initially, we documented with pictures to illustrate the change in fluorescence and we observed a relatively smooth increase in brightness as the arabinose concentration increased.As illustrated in the flow cytometry characterization, we do see some cells fluorescing even when no arabinose is present, therefore the pBad promoter is leaky.Although the promoter is leaky, it is sufficient for our proof of concept at this stage of our project.Wehypothesized the lower copy number plasmid would provide more distinction between the concentrationsof AHL, especially after our first result in which all concentrations including the negative control turned adeep red.If the leakiness needed to be addressed, the promoter could be transferred to a lower copy plasmid or one could use a weaker pBAD promoter such as BBa_K206001, thereby reducing the effects of leakiness.When induced with (N-B-ketocaproyl)-L-homoserine lactone, a specific AHL molecule, the LuxPr promoter will allow transcription of RFP.However, the upper concentrations we aimed to test failed to grow, so the experiment should beWe had planned to test the promoter on a 4C5 backbone instead of the 1C3 used in this experiment.More tests should be done to confirm this trend and find the ideal concentration.Because we are using pBad as our promoter to start the cascade of responses in our system, we needed to test the leakiness of the promoter.4H (green) is the 10nm sample.All three of the samples with AHL added produced relatively more fluorescence than the negative control.A concentration of 10nm produced the most RFP, so would be the ideal concentration to use according tothis data.The 4th culture had low growth.Flow cytometry was performed on the cells after being resuspended in PBS which returned the resulting data.With the exception of the fourth sample, which was the culture with low growth, we see a general rightward trend in the peaks, indicating that higher concentrations of arabinose are more effective at inducing the production of the integrase.To do this, we put pBad on a 1C3 plasmid with Red Fluorescent Protein

we saw much less expression of our reporter.To test the responsiveness of our integrase in tandem with the leakiness of the gate on a low copy plasmid we co-transformed the Bxb1 integrase behind the arabinose inducible promoter on a kanamycinbackbone with BBa_K1718005 (switch-LuxI-GFP) on 4C5.It was tested by growing cells in overnight cultures with varying concentrations of arabinose, from 0% to .2%increasing by .04% for a total of 6 cultures.To characterize and test the leakiness of the LuxPr promoter, we created a construct that placed the LuxPr promoter in front of RFP on a 1C3 backbone.To further characterize this observation, we grew up overnights with varying concentrations of arabinose and measured their fluorescence.Initially, we documented with pictures to illustrate the change in fluorescence and we observed a relatively smooth increase in brightness as the arabinose concentration increased.As illustrated in the flow cytometry characterization, we do see some cells fluorescing even when no arabinose is present, therefore the pBad promoter is leaky.Although the promoter is leaky, it is sufficient for our proof of concept at this stage of our project.Wehypothesized the lower copy number plasmid would provide more distinction between the concentrationsof AHL, especially after our first result in which all concentrations including the negative control turned adeep red.If the leakiness needed to be addressed, the promoter could be transferred to a lower copy plasmid or one could use a weaker pBAD promoter such as BBa_K206001, thereby reducing the effects of leakiness.When induced with (N-B-ketocaproyl)-L-homoserine lactone, a specific AHL molecule, the LuxPr promoter will allow transcription of RFP.However, the upper concentrations we aimed to test failed to grow, so the experiment should beWe had planned to test the promoter on a 4C5 backbone instead of the 1C3 used in this experiment.More tests should be done to confirm this trend and find the

of the samples with AHL added produced relatively more fluorescence than the negative control.A concentration of 10nm produced the most RFP, so would be the ideal concentration to use according tothis

these whole-genome metabolic models are becoming increasingly available (Jayaraman and Hahn 2009, Methods in Bioenegineering).This enables researchers to engineer community members, composition, interactions, and environment to make the consortia have more desirable characteristics such as efficiency of production or stability (Mahadevana and Henson 2012, Biggs et al 2015).Early modeling efforts used an unstructured and lumped approach, in which all cellular components were lumped in the total biomass concentration and growth depended on a single limiting substrate.The main challenges of dFBA are determining the substrate uptake kinetics, which must be done experimentally, and numerically solving the dFBA problem ((Jayaraman and Hahn 2009, Methods in Bioenegineering).Here, we apply dFBA to model our co-culture of C. hutchinsonii and E. coli.Two important advancements greatly improved these models: (1) the development of a cellular/community objective function that is maximized using linear programming and (2) the advent of genome-sequencing technologies which allowed the construction of genome-scale metabolic models.Thus, dFBA accounts for time-varying microbial interactions, and allows for the prediction of microbial population, substrate utilization, and product formation dynamics (Bernstein and Carlson 2012).The goal of our models is to predict how the bacterial populations and metabolite concentrations in our co-culture change over time under different conditions.2011), and modified it by adding the genes/reactions for biodiesel production, changing the exchange reaction bounds to reflect our culture conditions, knocking out genes to optimize biodiesel production, and adding genes/reactions to account for our synthetic communication network.', 'notebook': 'A strong LuxR signal (suggesting an abundance of C. hutchinsonii) will cause the LasR AHL to be sent from E.

scarcity, fossil resource dependence and climate change[4].However, the transition towards a bioeconomy will rely on the advancement in technology of a range of processes, on theachievement of a breakthrough in terms of technical performances and cost effectiveness and will depend on the availability of sustainable biomass[5].Bio-based products play an important part in the sustainable future, but are dependent on cheap and available biomassAdvancement in technologies are dependend on us, the scientists, however the availability of sustainable biomass is limited by the arable area of our planet.To fight poverty and worldhunger for a growing population, we are up rooting primal forests and plowing meadows every year.Therefore, companies already developed new systems to concentrate the CO2 from air[11] [12] [13]We need hundreds of companies working on thousands of ideas, including crazy-sounding ones that don\x92t get enough funding, such as [...] solar chemical (using the energy of the sun to make hydrocarbons)The nobel price winner George Olah predicted in his book: "Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy", that a future sustainable economy will use methanol as a key component.That means, we would have to convert a lot of arable land to grow food and even more to monoculture of energy crops to get enough biomass for the production of biofuels and other important products.An undesired future szenario - Large surfaces are used for the cultivation of energy cropsUsing biological waste can contribute to a suitable soluiton, but we have to be careful not to become deserted the arable land considering the amount of fertilizer we will have to use if we would harvest the whole plant and use it for biotechnological processes instead of just harvesting crops and returning the straw to the field.However, burning down primal forest seems not only insufficient to solve the world hunger, but it also contributes to climate change and destroys the environment.If we keep up with the current development, climate change and a lowering ground water will destroy more arable land than we can spare.If we hardly manage to feed the population, how can we guarantee the supply of biomass for other biotechnological products?Our living standard is mainly based on fossil resources.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) sees the bio-based products of the growing bioeconomy as a pillar for a sustainable future[3].Furthermore, many industrial products can t be synthesized from it and we will not be able to change all the existing biotechnological infrastructure to base on methanol.In fact, the conversion from methanol to glycogen upvalues a common industrial side product and provides the energetic potential of methanol to a broader field of industry.Today, starch from more than 480 million tonnes of cereals is used for industrial purposes[15].Hereby, the bioeconomy is one key component of a sustainable and independent future.The Search for an Alternative Carbon SourceThanks a lot to Wisam Zureik for recording and processing the video material!Someday, our children, and our children s children, will look us in the eye and they ll ask us, did we do all that we could when we had the chance to deal with this problem and leave them with a cleaner, safer, more stable world?Our world is facing serious global problems.70% of the electrical energy used contributes to the calorific value of the methanol produced)Recent technological achievments made it possible to convert CO2 into methanol with an incredible efficieny.The efficency of energy that is converted into chemical energy is about 80 times higher than the conversion of CO2 to biomass through plants and even 18 times higher than the maximal efficieny natural photosynthesis can reach[10].Of course these processes depend on high concentrations of CO2.Therefore, we can save primal forests, make a difference in the global CO2 concentrations and liberate cereals to be used as food.?

Scarlat N., et al.,The role of biomass and bioenergy in a future bioeconomy: Policies and facts.According to an official european public survey, the two most pressing ones are poverty and climate change[1]Many scientists work hard on both problems, but only together, we are able to find a solution.Therefore, we need to find a process to convert methanol into a complex carbon source, that can substitute for a currently important platform substance, starch.Plant starch is a storage molecule, consisting of ?-1,4-linked glucose monomers and ?-1,6-connected branches to form the predominant amylopectin.We need to find a way to use CO2 from air to form new products without taking up huge areas of arable landMethanol production has a potential energy efficency of around 70\xa0% (i.e.This means that the agricultural land grew only around 0.9\xa0%[6], which is partially caused by desertification and climate change.In the last 20 years, we deforested around 130 million ha, while getting only 47.5 million ha of agricultural area.for drug delivery systems.By upcycling methanol into glycogen, we provide a sustainable substrate for biotechnological processes and save millions of tonns of foodcrops that would have gone into industrial use.To get independent from fossil fuels, we have to developed new processes.Starch: From Food to Medicine, Scientific, Health and Social Aspects of the Food Industry, Dr. Benjamin Valdez (Ed.When we want to get independent, we will have to find other ways to get all of these products.For instance the food, textile and chemical sector as well as the paper industry rely on this basic material.A smaller percentage of typical starch granules consists of the linear form, amylose.However, we will run out of this fossil fuels and all the produced CO2 already changed our environment dramatically.At the same time we estimate a population growth of 0.77\xa0% each year!The only difference are more frequent ?-1,6-linked branching points every 8-12 units and the complete absence of linear molecules.', 'description': 'But before glycogen accumulation can be engineered in these organisms, our glgP knockout strain and the methanol assimilation BioBricks will be valuable tools to further understand the regulation of these pathways.With our small-scale bioreactor technology, further metabolic engineering research towards a methanol-based bioeconomy will be accelerated.The energy price kept dropping and renewable energy became more efficient and available.Most of the fuels are sustainably produced by technical conversion to hydrocarbons, which are available in huge amounts.The biotechnology and starch based industry is based on a variety of substrates, mainly wastes and glycogen produced from renewable methanol.The arable land that was previously used to grow energy crops is now renatured or used for food crops.This way the interplay of protein expression and metabolic activity can be optimized.Our results indicate that HPLC might be very useful in the optimization of glycogen analytics as soon as a better purification method is developed.As the genetic tools get more advanced, other organisms can be considered.In our project, we were able to show that our engineered E.\xa0coli strains are able to grow in the presence of high methanol concentrations and can also accumulate glycogen.The renaturing of area that was a former part of the bioeconomy, now binds a large amount of CO2 from the atmosphere which was essential to begin reversing global warming.With the left over arable land and improved agriculture, we can guarantee food security without an extensive use of fertilizers.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'With reactions for the major-mode methanol condensation cycle (MCC) the maximal biomass reaction rate increases to 1.4.After we considered the number of genes that have to be introduced recombinantly and the presence of native formaldehyde degradation routes, we chose E.\xa0coli as our host organism.In the iJO1366 model, the glycogen metabolism is modeled with two metabolites glycogen_c and bglycogen_c that represent unbranched and branched polysaccharide chains.In order to model glycogen formation, we introduced exchange reactions for glycogen_c and bglycogen_c and optimized the model with the glycogen_c exchange reaction as the objective function.When the glucose exchange reaction was set to a lower bound of 0 and methanol exchange to -10 (methanol as the only carbon source) and the model was optimized for the glycogen exchange reaction, a formation rate of 1.67 was observed.At the same time the ATP synthesis and consumption is fully balanced between five reactions: ATPS4rpp, PPKr, ATPM, PFK, GLGC.Conversion of Methanol to GlycogenThe iJO1366 model was constrained to a methanol uptake rate of -10 and no CO2 uptake.Using stoichiometric modeling we can make predictions for the conversion pathway and decide on a host organism.To model through which reactions molecules are converted within a biochemical network, all reactions have to be represented in a mathematical form.To construct the "major mode" configuration of the methanol condensation cycle (MCC) in E.\xa0coli, the Mdh, Hps and Phi have to be expressed together with the phosphoketolase Xpk.To test if the introduction of the four reactions is sufficient to enable methanol assimilation, we added missing metabolites and reactions to the iJO1366 model.By addition of missing reactions from the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP), a maximal biomass reaction rate of 1.2 is possible.Reactions that were introduced to the model are named with a double underscore (__).Furthermore, the physiology of these strains is less understood.Wild type E.\xa0coli is not able to utilize methanol as a carbon source.Escher [7] was used for visualization.The metabolic network is modeled under the steady-state assumption, i.e., all metabolite concentrations and reaction rates are constantAt the beginning, we searched for organisms that are worth considering for our purposes.By the heterologous expression of three enzymes, the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP) can be introduced to E.\xa0coli [8].Reaction of the Methanol DehydrogenaseMethanol is oxidized and NADH is generated.Formation of the C6-body ba the hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (hps)Formaldehyde is assimilated with ribulose-5-hosphate to hexulose-6-phosphate.A disadvantage of the RuMP is the consumption of one ATP per assimilated formaldehyde molecule.Recently an ATP-neutral assimilation route was found in-silico [9].[1]We evaluated three candidate organisms for our conversion pathway using their genome-scale stoichiometric models:The models were loaded with COBRApy [5] and solved with GLPK [6].Due to the steady-state assumption, the model does not have exchange-reactions for glycogen.All reactions have lower- and upper-bounds that also determine if the reaction is reversible.In the steady-state of the biochemical network, the product of the matrix with the vector is the null vector.Gathering information to understand how the biochemical network operates works by setting constraints onto the reaction rates.Is it possible to go from the C1 molecule methanol to the C6 polysaccharide glycogen?In all test scenarios we introduced the metabolites D-arabino-hex-3-ulose\xa06-phosphate and D-fructofuranose\xa06-phosphate.Theoretical growth rate with different uptake pathwaysThe unmodified iJO1366 model is not able to grow methanol (EX_meoh_e=-10) as the sole carbon source.This is achieved by constructing a really big matrix that represents every reaction in the network and the stoichiometric coefficients of that reaction.EnvironmentalDevelopment(2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2015.03.006? Reconstruction and validation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae iND750, a fully compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic model, Duarte et.To test a certain scenario, for example the growth on glucose, the upper and lower bound will be set to less extreme values.The solution of this optimization process then gives information about the flux distribution within the biochemical network.The glycogen formation rate of 1.67 shows that theoretically all carbon atoms can be converted from methanol to glycogen.', 'notebook': 'Here we provide construction manuals and more detailed information:The

chemicals, microorganism and waste in our laboratory, and how we think our organism and bioreactor will be used by other people.During the competition period we have collaborated and discussed about safety issues with many iGEM teams, but also with people from community labs and the industry.Our project falls into the category of metabolic engineering and our genetically modified cells are not intended for any use outside of an industrial facility.On the other hand, handling genetically modified organisms and methanol in a production facility does require several safety measures.Not only did we discuss biosafety throughout our project, but we were also very aware of working responsibly and safely with methanol in our growth experiments.As a result, the safety risks of using methanol are decreased remarkably while maintaining the high energy capacity of methanol.Even though biological laboratories in Germany are tightly regulated, biosafety is still a major concern to the public.One question that we wanted to answer was: Are touchscreens a good idea in the lab?To find out, we did a simple experiment: Sampling of microbes from keyboards and other surfaces in the lab.Although people have a higher suspicion towards community labs.We invited people from the Technik Garage[3], a community lab close to Hannover (Beckedorf), to Aachen and discussed via Skype call with the team Paris Saclay[4] about biosafety in general and about strategies against accidentially introduction of GMOs into the environment, which is by far the greatest concern of the public.To address that concern team Paris Saclay developed two containment strategies for GMOs, which could be usedby community labs as well.A high-quality solution of a problem is of no value if the damaged created exceeds the benefits of the solution.Like any other work, the work in laboratories has its own workplace health and safety regulations.Learn more about it on our safety form.Methanol is an important part of the chemical industry as it is used for plastics, paints, glues, and pharmaceuticals.Problematic situations especially occur when methanol gets out of a continuous, closed system or when it gets transported to a different facility.Consequently, there is the need to advance the methanol generating industry with a low proximity conversion system.We regard safety regulations as a necessity for our own well being and the environment.', 'keywords': 'flowthrough CRISPR-Cas expression transcription peristaltic nitrogenase Synechocystis temperature bioeconomy environments',

(left) and EtBr (right) to stain the DNA.We ran an SDS-PAGE gel using the samples collected from the experiment we did on August 19th.After realizing that the copper solution was interfering with our OD data, we decided to resuspend the cells in LB and use LB as our blank to gather the OD data.We ran an inoculation experiment using the cells with the CUP1 codon-optimized gene.Gel results showed no bands Digestion of the metallothionein plasmid with restriction enzymes (EcoRI & PstI).This gel showed a band in the Ret2 samples at a size of around 32 kDa, while our Metallothionein protein was expected to be around 6.5 kDa.The control plate had only a few colonies growing on it, even after a second attempt while the transformed had multiple colonies.We also ran two more gels with the experiment for Ret1 data.Another inoculation experiment was scheduled for today, however the tube of the overnight cells broke so instead a repeat of the overnight was done.After the optical density was read for the solution, the solutions were centrifuged and the supernatant in the eppendorfs were removed to be used for copper measurement.Repeated analysis of the digestion products on the gel.An overnight will be done tomorrow for the experiment on the following day.We noticed that we had to create different blanks due to the different copper concentrations that we did not do for the previous experiments.Since the Laemmli Buffer was nowhere to be found,the solution was spun down to be put in the freezer for the SDS gel in the future.Meeting with our advisor regarding current updates on the project and the availability of the flame atomic absorption spectrometer to be used for the copper measurement.Data was collected in the same manner except with a 30 minute time point after the one hour mark.Six flasks of 25 mL LB broth were prepared, 3 of which will be the control and the other will be for the transformed.We also discussed team structure and the CUP1 gene construct that is needed to be synthesized as a G-block.Based on the lanes with the least amount of noise (colonies 7 and 8), we transformed our competent cells using the DNA corresponding to those colonies.The control was spread on plates with ampicilin resistance and the transformed group was spread on plates with chloramphenicol resistance.To the transformed group 9.375uL of Chloramphenicol was added.The pellet in the eppendorfs were then resuspended with 200uL of master mix of Laemmli Buffer and were placed in the freezer to be used to run an SDS-gel in the future.At every hour for eight hours, starting at the 0th hour, an optical density reading will be taken for each flask.Drawing out 1mL of the solution from each flask into eppendorfs, followed by measuring the optical density.After further investigation, the Bulls-Eye solution was the cause of bands not appearing and we switched to Ethidium Bromide.iGEM team members attended a meeting with a professor and was given an overview to the procedure of 3A Assembly.7 uL of the Sigma Aldrich Wide Range Ladder (6-205 kDA) was added to the first lane while the other 10 lanes each contained 10 uL of samples from the experiment.From the second inoculation experiment, the eppendorfs were thawed on ice in preparation for the 10% SDS-gel.The second method uses a plate reader to measure the florescence of the sample.The second iGEM part, CUP1 codon optimized came in the day prior.The plate reader could not measure the florescence because there were no appropriate filters in the lab to emit higher than 700nm.Repeated digestion to troubleshoot any possible errors that may have occurred during the protocol.Today marks the first day we began production of our first cell line, Retriever 1(Ret1).The CUP1 transformed cells and control cells were plated and an overnight was done.The digestion products were then run on a gel stained with ethidium bromide.From Copper Sulfate, a stock solution of 0.5M Copper Solution was created and then a 0.1M Solution was created to be used.', 'protocol': 'An example label for a sample with Retriever 1 and initial copper concentration 0 mM at hour 3 would be "Ret1, 0 mM, h 3" with

it showed a marked increase in copper uptake as compared to the control strain.In the future, we would like to adjust the expression of the LamB metallothionein fusion in order to increase the viability of the cell line.Each strain was tested for cell density and extracellular copper concentration at different initial copper sulfate concentrations for 7-10 hours.Ret1 and Ret3 showed no significant cell growth, possibly due to the toxicity of the protein, or due to the stress placed on the cell from protein synthesis.Eventually, we would like to insert a gasification gene in order to allow for the easy collection of copper laden E. coli.The Ret2 strain showed increased cell viability in high copper concentrations, but did not show any significant increase in copper uptake

and Synthetic Biology.We have actively been in touch with media, in order to spread the idea of Synthetic Biology to the general public, which is a large part of what makes this competition important.Lastly, we also do collaborations because it is fun!In our project, Biology and Astrophysics are closely intertwined, and as such both disciplines are needed to successfully apply Synthetic Biology to a Mars expedition.We feel that different backgrounds all bring something of value to the table, which is greater than the sum of its parts.Collaboration with other iGEM teams, universities and media has also been one of our focus points.Traditionally, many iGEM teams have been composed of a large majority of people with a biological background.However, SpaceMoss is an interdisciplinary team, with members from a wide range of different academic disciplines like Astrophysics, Molecular Biology, Social Sciences and Business.Below is a picture from one of our presentations held in Uppsala, Sweden at the Nordic iGEM conference.Collaboration with other iGEM helps us make team SpaceMoss better, due to feedback, workshops and interesting discussions, and for that we want to thank all our collaborators.Collaborations is not only necessary to produce a sound and interesting project, but it is also an essential way to tie all our visions together through outreach and lab work.To better communicate to the general public we had our project description turned into a, comic strips and made several short films.The project is keenly focused on raising awareness about the following

conclusive, they suggest a slight increase in the survivability of transformed moss after being frozen at -20*c and -60*c. This increase in survivability could be due to the UNIK antifreeze gene.The transformed moss was able to grow from protoplasts to full clumps on media containing Kanamycin (50 mg/ml), which suggests that the nptII-resistance cassette provides P. Patens with resistance to Kanamycin.To further validate this, an additional experiment were outlined where WT moss was grown on either non-selective PhyB-media (3 plates) or PhyB-media containing Kanamycin 50 mg/ml (3 plates).While the presence of YFP in the transformed antifreeze moss suggest expression of the antifreeze protein, the question remains if the antifreeze protein improves the moss ability to survive cold temperatures.To answer this question, we filled our self designed PhyscoFreezer (see Red lab for more information) with dry ice and put a plate containing 3 transformed clumps of P.patens and a plate of WT moss straight down into the dry ice.A) Moss transformed with the UNIK antifreeze gene 2 days after being frozen.B and C) Moss transformed with the UNIK antifreeze gene 7 days after being frozen.A few days after transformation the moss protoplasts was observed under a fluorescent microscope and YFP-expression was visible in moss protoplasts for the antifreeze and the STS construct (fig.3) YFP filter with 500/20 excitation and 535/30 emission.The transformed moss protoplasts were then moved to PhyB-plates containing Kanamycin (50 mg/ml) and were left to grow for a few weeks.This is a stark contrast to the transformed moss that was able to grow from protoplasts to full clumps and the more vibrant WT moss grown on nonselective media (fig.A) A moss protoplast transformed with the antifreeze construct.No such peak is present for WT or transformed STS moss samples (red, purple lines).The first moss transformation confirmed the function of the Zea Mays ubiquitin promoter (ZmUbi) since YFP was present in the transformed moss protoplasts.This suggests that resveratrol is not produced in the transformed moss.The WT moss planted on Kanamycin containing plates grew very little or not at all and is seen under the microscope as withering (fig.First, the wild type moss clumps looked amorphous and with the rhizoids in a collapsed mass (fig.However, the LC-MS machine was not able to detect resveratrol in the 3 STS transformed moss samples.The same bright autofluorescence and green colour was not observed for the frozen WT moss.This suggests that part of the antifreeze moss was still alive.3 A1), while the antifreeze moss clumps seemed to have conserved their structure.Photo taken 8 days after the moss was planted.The moss protoplasts transformed with the STS-construct were left to grow for 6 weeks.2 days after, strong autofluorescence was observed in one clump of antifreeze moss but not in WT (fig.B) A moss protoplast transformed with our STS construct.From around the time we started in the laboratory, we spent a lot of time just optimizing the PCR reactions for Piece A and C. Not only was it hard to just get a band on the gel, it was also difficult to amplify a high enough amount of each piece, since you need 30 ug of DNA total for our moss transformation protocol.Figure 2: A clump of antifreeze transformed P.Patens showing YFP-expression grown on Kanamycin containing plates (50 mg/ml).C) A moss protoplast transformed with a vector expressing YFP.We also took 3 equal sized clumps of WT moss and put them on new PhyB-media.After 7 days both WT and antifreeze moss looked brown and withered.It demonstrated that the gene construct design works and that moss can combine different DNA pieces with matching overhangs using homologous recombination.We imagine that future teams can do experiments with our antifreeze moss and/or do additional transformations with our lines, to make them even more adapted to the martian environment.100% methanol was used for extraction and both WT moss as a negative control and transformed moss was extracted.One month after transformation, there was ten growing clumps of antifreeze transformed moss.B) Wild type moss grown on kanamycin containing plates (50 mg/ml).B) WT moss 2 days after being frozen.A) WT moss 7 days after being frozen.Secondly, what seems to be cells still containing living chloroplasts were observed on one of the antifreeze clumps.A) Wild type moss on media without kanamycin.This confirms that the transformation was a success and highly suggests that the genes of interest - antifreeze and STS - are expressed.C) Wild type moss without kanamycin on top and with kanamycin on bottem.A peak corresponding to resveratrol without a hydrogen atom 227,1 g/mol, is seen on the standard (fig.The next day the PhyscoFreezer still contained dry ice and we replated our transformed on moss on new PhyB-media.White arrowheads indicate green colour or autofluorescence D) WT moss that has not been frozen.Unfortunately, the ZmUbi promoter sequence had four illegal restriction sites towards the 3  end, which prevented it from being added to the registry as a biobrick.Seven of those clumps of moss were expressing YFP (fig.After transformation of moss protoplasts no transformants expressing YFP was observed.After 6 weeks the protoplasts had grown into small moss clumps.This suggests stable integration of the antifreeze gene construct.It is therefore unlikely that the promoter works without the 3  part, even though single transformants may have been missed under the microscope.Doing PCRs can be surprisingly hard.After 7 days, there was a visible difference in growth between WT on non-selective media and WT on Kanamycin plates (fig.We would then try to verify the promoters function without the 3  end sequence with the illegal restriction sites.', 'safety': 'This means that work is restricted to genetically modified microorganisms and/or cell cultures, which are not suspected to be pathogenic to humans.Thus our main concerns are to the preserve the natural ecosystem and minimize the risk of spreading transgenic moss into the wild.Our team followed a lab tour concerning the biosafety in the lab provided by experienced laboratory technician Britta Hamberger.We have therefore taken certain precautions in the lab to avoid this worst case scenario as we are working with a GMO after all.The aim of the Treaty is to prevent forward and back contamination during a space mission.To work with GMO there is specific requirements to the laboratory depending on the risk pose by the organisms you work with.(www.at.dk)We also took part of a workshop concerning Biosafety at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) held by the DTU iGEM team.We have transformed Physcomitrella Patens with genes from grapes and a worm.The Resveratrol gene from grapes would most likely not be beneficial for the wildtype moss if it was released back into the wild.The slightly rarer case would be back contamination, which is the risk of bringing unknown lifeforms - if they do exist - back to earth.Biosafety is the prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins and their accidental release, which is important when dealing with gene modified organisms (GMOs).At the workshop we also developed our knowledge in lab safety procedures and we got familiarized with PCR, cloning and transformation.Before the workshop every team member had to complete a short safety quiz that allowed us to evaluate our knowledge.We do not know the implication the release of the modified moss could have on the natural ecosystem.Forward contamination is the contamination of a celestial object by organisms from earth that may have contaminated the spacecraft on the way to the object.Because GMOs are organisms that are not naturally encountered in the environment their release to the environment can form a safety issue.', 'keywords': 'constructed UMBC15project1 crystalline trans-zeatin angiostatin interdisciplinary specificity angiogenesis scientists applications', 'track': 'Environment', 'part_favorite': '', 'part_normal': 'BBa_K1825000\nBBa_K1825004\nBBa_K1825005\nBBa_K1825006\nBBa_K1825007\nBBa_K1825008', 'theme': '201', 'hits': 0}}, {'_index': 'team_wiki', '_type': 'wiki', '_id': 'AV3_VN_Fr5lUclF2BU6q', '_score': 0.2884369, '_source': {'year': '2016', 'team_name': 'NorthernBC', 'attribution': 'Steve Helle secondary investigator and environmental consultantMartha Stark laboratory mentor, assisted with problem solving, assisted with understanding results.The grad students of the Rader, Gorrell and Chow labs for assisting with problem solving and equipment usageDonny Van Dyk and Petra Andrea Helped us organise the team and found ways to keep the work fun and entertaining The members of the UNBC Synthetic Biology Club Fundraising, event planning, project design, good times and great friends', 'background': '', 'description': 'Currently the most effective method of remediation is the use of chemical adsorbents, for example commercially activated carbon, which has a very high and restrictive cost associated with it; this makes it far from a globally attainable solution for copper removal (Bhatnagar & Sillanpaa, 2010).Although each of these methods is successful to a degree in removing copper from water, none exist without detrimental pitfalls (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).At least two-third of all First Nation communities in Canada have been under water advisory at some time in the last decade (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015).Although these methods are generally the most economical, and low in technology costs, they all involve plant growth, which render disadvantages due to dependence on growth conditions, requirement of large-scale agricultural equipment, and knowledge, long remediation timelines and potential environmental harm due to leaching of soluble contaminants (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).It is possible to bypass this problem by using the protein YiaT anchor system designed by Han and Lee to bind and sequester copper outside the cell (2014).Furthermore, the solubility of metal hydroxides poses the problem of precipitating one heavy metal out of solution, and another back in due to their individual maximum precipitation pH\x92s (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).Han and Lee discovered that when truncated at the arginine residue 232 (R232), the Pseudomonas lipase could be fused to the new C-terminal end of YiaT to make a functional fusion protein (2014).Currently, the removal of copper from water is accomplished through a slew of methods ranging from large-scale and industrious technologies to small-scale household friendly products.The community of Trail, BC has battled pollution from Teck Metals since 1975 (Hume 2016).The community is afflicted with contaminated landfills, slag deposits that leach into waterways and a substantial plume that has spread beneath the city and the Columbia River (Hume 2016).Particularly, Alexis Creek First Nation, Nazko First Nation and Lake Babine, all in British Columbia, have water problems spanning 16 years (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015).Our team is investigating methods of copper binding in order to contribute to the promising advancement of this remediation method.Children from the community have also demonstrated elevated levels of lead in their blood (Hume 2016).This poses a problem when attempting to use E. coli to remove heavy metals from water.Remediation of heavy metals in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems: Processes and applications.B., & Muchie, M.

transformation of lignocellulosic biomass in useful products.E.coli expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) and C.crescentus expressing red fluorescence protein (RFP), seen in Figure 1, were inoculated at an initial OD600 of 0.01 with feed stock of 0.2wt% or 11.1mM glucose in 96-well plate and the plate was incubated at 30C in a Tecan platereader.For this, we decided to design a microbial consortia to separated metabolic processes between two members - Caulobacter and E.coli.For the second part, we chose E.coli producing ?-carotene as a proof of concept because it is colored, making it easily detectable.M16 minimal media was also considered as a candidate for the co-culture experiments, however, a complicated recipe made it a poor choice for our cultures.To better assess dynamics of each bacteria in consortia we are currently growing the co-culture for 3 days and plate every 12 hours on PYE-agar media to count CFU of C.crescentus and E. coli.Another result from this experiment is the indication that the dissolved oxygen concentration must be increased in order to successfully culture and sustain a high density of E.coli using expressed cellulases on the C.crescentus surface to degrade cellulose for substrate.Presley, Gerald N. et al.As seen in Figure 2, at longer culture times, the growth rate of E.coli drops significantly while the growth of C. crescentus climbs steadily.Following nature s examples, there is an increasing trend in using microbial communities for biotechnological application due to their robustness and the ability to perform complex metabolic tasks through the division of labor(Shong, Jimenez Diaz, and Collins 2012).Successfully grew Caulobacter and E.coli in M2 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% glucose.C.crescentus p4A723 cultures inoculated into this media did not grow successfully as no growth was observed after 4 days of incubation.The goal of our project is to design a stable, robust microbial community for the production of valuable compounds from lignocellulosic biomass.Because there is no species dependence with glucose as a substrate, any negative impacts caused by co-culture should be evident with this method, and the compatibility of these species can be evaluated.The decline in E. coli growth rate, while C. crescentus growth rate is affected minimally, possibly indicates that the glucose feedstock is not completely consumed and that oxygen could be limiting in microwells at relatively low culture densities for E. coli.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'These values were incorporated into the model to complete the required constants for operation.Figure 4: Cellulase rate determination through plotting substrate concentration as a function of time against initial substrate concentration.When the production of glucose through cellulose degradation and the consumption due to the growth of E. coli and C. crescentus are combined, the ordinary differential equation describing glucose utilization can be developed.The final model correlation can be seen in Figure 2.Equation 2: Differential Equation for Species GrowthFigure 2: Comparison of experimental data to modelled results for C.crescentus with initial glucose concentrations of 2.77, 5.56, 11.1, 22.2 M To obtain the maximum growth rate for the E.coli species, several E.coli cultures were compared to C. crescentus cultures grown at the same temperature and substrate conditions.An analysis of this plot produced ?max of 0.156 hr-1 and a Ks of 0.403 mM.Figure 1: Lineweaver-Burk plot for C.crescentus with initial glucose concentrations of 2.77, 5.56, 11.1, 22.2 M Differential equations using the Monod growth rate can be made for the change in species concentration as a function of time, seen in Equation 2.Using these experimentally determined values, ordinary differential equations for a mixed culture were developed assuming that both E. coli and C. crescentus behaved competitively and that cellulose degradation by expressed cellulase enzymes on the C. crescentus surface did not favor C. crescentus due to diffusion gradients.To model substrate limited growth, Monod kinetics provided a relationship between substrate concentration and species growth, seen in Equation 1.Using this information, the ordinary differential equation describing cellulose degradation can be developed, Equation 3.Equation 3: Differential equation for Michaelis-Menten kinetics including modification for growth rate dependency.To determine cellulose activity as a function of cell density and substrate concentration, an absorbance based assay with initial DNP-cellubioside concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL, 0.05 mg/mL, and 0.02mg/mL was inoculated with C.crescentus at optical densities at 600nm of 0.3 and 0.6.A stoichiometric factor is included before the production term to compensate for the number of moles of glucose released from cellulose or cellubiose.Equation 4: Differential equation for glucose generation and consumption as a function of time and species concentration.The developed differential equations can be combined and solved using the ode45 function in MATLAB to produce predictions for different initial concentrations of E.coli and C.crescentus.A damping function was also used for E.coli, allowing E.coli growth to match experimental data.Figure 3: Comparison of E.coli and C. crescentus growth rates in M2 media, with 22.2mM glucose in micro wells.To model the rate of cellulose degradation into glucose through the expressed enzyme activity, a modified Michaelis-Menten relationship is used.The developed codes can be obtained as a zip file here, or as a text file here .For growth where dissolved oxygen concentration is not limiting, and glucose is the primary substrate, E.coli will be the dominant species for the duration of the culture, seen in Figure 5.To supplement initial E.coli growth, a small initial glucose concentration could provide initial cell numbers, and allow increased growth overall, seen in Figure 8.Figure 7: Consortia model predictions with cellulose as the only substrate.Figure 8: Consortia model predictions with cellulose as the primary substrate and small initial glucose concentration of 2.77mM.In order to improve the selectivity and yield of E. coli compared to C. crescentus, several alternative routes are possible.Equation 1: Monod Kinetics for Substrate Limited GrowthThe maximum specific growth rate and saturation constant can be obtained for our system by evaluating the growth rates for a range of initial substrate concentrations for each strain desired in the model.With several growth rates as a function of substrate concentrations, the inverse of both the rate and the substrate concentration can be plotted to produce a Lineweaver-Burk plot.First, the rate of cellulose degradation can be increased through temperature or other further cellulase development to produce higher concentrations of glucose in the media, increasing the growth rate of E.coli directly.The experimentally determined growth rate seemed to decrease as a function of cell density, and as a result, a damping function of the inverse natural exponent to the power of cell density was included in the differential equation.With a series of biomass concentration values over a range of time, plotting the natural logarithm of each biomass concentration produces a linear plot with a slope equal to the strain growth rate on substrate.Figure 5: Initial model predictions based on growth rates without consortium data.Based on co-culture experiments, the damping factor for E.coli growth rate was increased by second power.A model has been developed to predict the growth of a co-culture dynamics of E.coli and cellulase expressing C.crescentus as a function of different cellulose concentrations, glucose concentrations and time.Since cellulase enzymes are expressed on the surface of C. Crescentus, a relationship between glucose formation, cell concentration and enzyme expression must be made.A model was developed to describe a mixed culture of C. crescentus and E.coli with cellulose and glucose as the primary feedstocks.Analysis of three triplicates for either species indicated that E.coli grew at rate greater than C. crescentus in the same conditions, a result that can be directly related to ?max.Based on these curves, the growth rate for E.coli is 3.1 times the growth rate for C. crescentus.When the Lineweaver-Burk plots are compared for either concentration, seen in Figure 4, there is no clear difference between them, indicating that concentration has negligible impact on the rate of cellulose degradation after a certain culture concentration has been reached.A prediction with modified damping factors to accommodate the observed stationary phase can be seen in Figure 6.Figure 6: Adjusted model predictions based on consortium data.In a system with cellulose as the only feedstock, growth would occur slowly and diffusion limitations could cause different growth mechanisms to be non-negligible, seen in Figure 7.The inverse of substrate degradation rate can be plotted against the inverse initial substrate concentrations to produce a Lineweaver-Burk plot.Typically, Vmax is a constant related to enzyme concentration and kinetics, however in the consortium system, enzyme concentration changes as a function of time based on the concentration of C. crescentus in the system.A culture to achieve a much higher yield and selectivity of E.coli on cellulose can be obtained by supplementing the initial culture with a small amount of glucose to stimulate exponential E.coli growth without reaching stationary phase.For a given time range, the differential equations would be discretized and solved producing the species and substrate concentrations as a function of time.The developed model predicts that growth on cellulose as the only feedstock is unlikely to be productive.In the absence of substrate limiting growth kinetics, with the same initial substrate concentration, the growth kinetics should differ based on the ?max of either species.Using a Lineweaver-Burk analysis for enzyme kinetics determined that the cellulase activity was not proportional to cell concentration at high cell densities, and thus, the only variables for glucose formation and cellulose degradation were cellulose concentration.The maximum specific growth rate of the culture, ?max, is the growth rate when substrate is in excess.These equations have been written in terms of OD600, and as a result, the yield terms can be obtained in terms of OD600 per gram or mole glucose.Instead, it was proposed that Vmax is a combination of enzyme activity, the number of enzymes expressed per C. crescentus, and the concentration of C. crescentus.To model our environment, the individual species growth, enzyme expression, and enzyme activity were experimentally determined at optimum co-culture conditions of 30 degrees Celsius in M2 media.Two constants, maximum specific growth rate and the saturation constant, are required to use the relationship.This result indicates that a consortium based on cellulose as the only feedstock is unlikely to be successful, as the cell accumulation will be low over long time periods.The combined differential equation for glucose feed stock in the system can be seen in Equation 4.Seen in our consortium results, a co-culture of E.coli and C.crescentus indicated that it s likely that the assumption of oxygen limitation is no longer valid.Two mixed culture dynamics exist in the developed consortia: competition, in which species compete for substrate, and commensalism, where one species requires the existence of another to survive.A second code, variables.m, was created to specify initial conditions, send equations specified in consortium.m to the built-in MATLAB function ode45, and plot the resulting predictions.Additionally, improving oxygen transfer may allow E.coli to produce higher concentrations of cell mass by removing the impact of the damping function.To determine the constants in our Michaeles-Menten kinetics, two Lineweaver-Burk plots are created using experimental data with two different cell concentrations and the average of the constants are used.The culture dynamics have been modelled using a system of four ordinary differential equations: one for each species, one for glucose consumption and formation, and one for cellulose degradation.', 'notebook':

time.', 'background': '', 'description': 'When honeycomb occurrence of disease was more serious on a board , we only could dispose of the pests on that board to prevent the transmission to other bees to reduce losses.Q: Our project is to create a gene medicine that can inhibit viral replication and add E. coli bacteria to the syrup to feed bees.It will use bees\x92 habits of feeding each other to achieve the effect of prevention and treatment of disease.Then we want to know whether the E. coli we add will have effects on honey quality and safety ?A: Actually, unprocessed honey contains various active microbes, such as yeast, E. coli and other bacteria.Do you have any ideas or suggestions for our two programs ?A:The program of import suicide gene in E. coli ,effect of suicide gene may not be as good as that in theory, in the end it may not effectively solve the security problems .So it remains to be confirmed,which you need to do experimental test .In addition, E. coli is not the dominant bacteria in honey, so basically you can not consider security issues.Q: If we made gene medicine products, compared with traditional chemical drugs in the market what are our competitive advantages?A: Your generic drugs can effectively treat CSBV and has small food safety risks to human as opposed to the traditional hazards of drugs on security issues.What is the traditional method we have to control this disease and what are the advantages of our technology?A:In early times this virus is very serious indeed, resulting in enormous loss of bees .Yeast program sounds good, but I did not study in this regard, I can not give you any advice.Q:Our idea is to make this technology into patents and product, we want to hear your views and suggestions on our industrial prospects of this technology.A:Now there is no direct treatment to the virus, if the RNA interference technology is successful, I think the outlook is still very good.One of the biggest problems is that we used E. coli to be the carrier, but we feared that these E. coli is a potential pathogen, resulting in intestinal infections and other diseases.Next we started the interview.Q:According to reports, the number of bees is now declining every year.But we do not know the accurate reasons for it.We would like to ask your views on this matter, as well as the impact on the apiculture in China?A:Yes, this problem is more serious in Europe and America.And we believe that in their future, the principle of playing will have a long-lasting effect in many aspects of their life.Professor Susong Kun:He was awarded Special Economic Animals (including Silkworm, Honeybees) PhD by Zhejiang University .Now he is the vice president of bee faculty in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University and he is Professor, doctoral tutor; positions bee scientist of modern industrial technology system , "Minjiang scholar" Professor; Deputy Secretary-General of China Institute of beekeeping, executive director of China Institute of beekeeping bee biology,deputy director of the professional Committee of three bee breeding, vice president and the Secretary-General of apiculture Zhejiang Association.These factors make China has not been a big impact.A:The reason for this problem is unknow , I think the reason is multifaceted and comprehensive.But now with the improvement of beekeeping technologies, as well as taking into account the impact of drugs on product quality .We seldom use the drugs.A: Because the disease first breaks out in the general body of the bee larvae but he impact on adult bees are relatively small.Such as environmental factors, electromagnetic, viruses, pesticides, etc., it is a common effect of these factors make reduction in the number of bees.While the population of Chinese bees is relatively small and product less honey.So people seldom farm them.These factors slowly caused the population of Italian bee rapidly expanding.However, the relative reduction was in Chinese bees population.To remove the barrier between science and normal people\x92s life, It is our responsibility to lead people into the wonderland of science.But most important of all, we actually have a common philosophy\x97\x97Playing is the best way of learning.It began from April this year with high Infectiousness and spread fast and strong.This disease is so difficult to cure that it resulted in economic loss.A:If this disease outbroke more serious in the past , then they could only be used some illicit chemicals to combat, such as oxytetracycline.Oxytetracycline is the most widely used medicine in China for it\x92s cheap and effective, but it can not be guaranteed that there will be no infection.Where a large number of use of pesticides will be a very important affecting factor.Q:We aim to cure Sacbrood disease which is caused by Chinese Sacbrood Virus.If it is put into the market, it will certainly have a incomparable advantages with other drugs.During the activity, we taught them everything we know about honeybees, and they did show a great interest in the small charming creature.We taught them the structure of honeybees and they were required to use a way they want to show us what they have learned.We aimed to inspire their interest in science, and make it clear that they all have a talent of doing science, for they all have a talent of playing and learning.Fanshu Park gave us a few training so that we know how to deal with kids, besides they helped us organized ten children and provided us an activity space and facilities needed.In 28th of August, we held an half-day activity.For this, we want to hear your views and suggestions?A:E.coli is indeed harmful and you also relates to a transgenic.So security of products in question must be paid attention to.Then we tried to spread the idea that everyone has the potential to be scientist as long as being offered an opportunity.And the discussion is, who cares?We successfully taught them the how to play correctly and scientifically by doing this way.After all, the honey will be marketed, and goes to public.This part may be a bit dull for kids, but when they were required to distinguish out real honey from fakes on their own, it seemed rather practical instead.To illustrate that everyone has a potential of being a scientist, or a engineer, we helped them to design their own project.Some kids tried to draw a picture of honeybee and some even tried to made a shape of honeybee by using plasticene.We also taught them the difference between real honey and fakes, so that in future they won\x92t make a terrible purchase.Instead of giving a dull lesson about biology, this year FAFU-China decided to teach children how to play correctly, how to play with principles from science, and finally they will find their own way to science.We cooperated with a semi-profit social organization Fanshu Park.If we add rules to play, we have a game which is actually what project is.But beekeepers have trained that two boxes of bees from the perspective of disease resistance, thanks to resistance to disease, and that two boxes of bees now develop into hundreds of boxes.Then we told him about the project and the process of experiment.But before that there are several issues you need to address, the first one is the safety of the products , this was just been mentioned before.This technique is equivalent to cure from the root , more direct thorough.Q:In the experiment, we paid special attention to bio-safety issues.Second, the quality honey which is sterilized will decline.Most of these drugs are expensive but the effect is good, so it has become a choice for traditional beekeepers.So if you can effectively solve these problems, it will be promising.A: Nowadays most bees Chinese beekeepers raise are Italian bees.The final prices of product and costs are also important issues, if you can solve these problems, I think it will be a dramatic product in apiculture.Expectancy is what do you think the answer for the question would be.But you have to take into account the cost and the use of generic drugs.The reason may be the unique Chinese bees followed by domestic beekeeping long history and rich experience.Over the past 4 years, Fanshu Park has successfully explored a new field in Fuzhou city and organized a bunch of children and parents on it\x92s back.The second one is the effect of the product, you must reach a certain level of effect.Part of the reason is that they are very experienced with holding activities for children.But for China, the problem is not that serious.But this time, we need some innovations, perhaps some funs too.Play is not only a simple process.Because now through artificial breeding, we have been able to reduce the harm caused by CSBV, so your products must have a better result.You\x92ll know that play provides everything you need in oder to be a scientist, and that is what motivates us.First, because the honey itself contains a certain amount of lysozyme, it has a bactericidal effect.', 'design': 'This is the easiest way we design for the usage of our product.Next add 5ml bacterial suspension of engineered bacteria into the forage, limiting the density under 1CFU/ml, which is within the standard of food security.Then you have the complete product.Beekeepers who don t know anything about synthetic biology can use this product simply by directly feeding infected hives with the product.Now we have the easiest forage for honeybees.', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': 'Immediately, we began to do double enzyme digestion(EcoR1/Xho1?EcoR1/Pst1).After gel recovery, we linked our target fragments to relative vectors with T4 ligase, 4?, overnight.Meanwhile, we collected data about the index of the condition of swarms again, which was used to analyze the effect of dsRdRp by Excel later.Pinking the positive colonies, PCR detection, and then plasmid extraction.Since now, we will obverse the change of population of them, the mortality, and the number of sealed brood and collect data every weeks until we get the obvious result.Considering we have not gotten RdRp-pSB1C3 yet,we decided to link T7 RNAP gene to pSB1C3 first.Anyway we would do it again tomorrow.On the one hand, we still could not link RdRp with pSB1C3 so that there still nothing on the plate.According to the result, we found that dsRdRp made a remarkable influence on the replication of CSBV.It was used as engineering bacteria for expressing dsRdRp.Also, considering the biosecurity of E.coli, we decided use yeast as the final transformation target.The expression quantity of RdRp gene declined either, which meant that dsRdRp really could inhibit the replication of CSBV.Even though we were succeed in using dsRdRp expressed in proeukaryotic system to prevent and cure CSBV, we still had to take care of some problem we met.We wonder if it was because of the efficiency of ligase or anything.On the other hand,we prepared another competent cell,HT115,which included T7 RNAP gene in its genome.Although the concentration of the plasmid was a little bit lower, it was enough to do sequencing.Considering the lower fidelity of the enzyme used for T7 amplification before, we changed into a better one called KD Plus and restarted to PCR, linking and transformation.The third sequencing still showed nothing right.The good one was we successfully got recombinant plasmid RdRp-L4440 while the bad one was nothing grew on the plate with CmRR.Further more, we want to use CRISPR-Cas9 system to make RdRp gene inserted into the genome of E.coli.Another part, we began to prepare the larvae of Chinese honeybee which was offered by our institute of bees.We put dsRNAs into fodder of the larvae of the honeybee to feed them.But we did again and the result was satisfied at that time.Tomorrow we will ask our advisor for some solutions and do it one more time.After figuring out the problem, we eventually got the all right dsRNAs.So we decided to use dsRdRp to inference CSBV.We used cDNA of RdRp and specific primers(Not1-F/Pst1-R?EcoR1-F/Pst1-R) to synthesize RdRp gene.Today was the first day that we began our project in the lab after we made a scientific plan.It was encouraging!Today we made RT-PCR with four sets of reverse specific primers and the RNA of CSBV to synthesize homologous cDNA(CSBV Helicase?Protease?VP1 and RdRp respectively).As we all know, RNA is easy to be digested in the environment.We added engineering bacteria with expressed dsRdRp, which was divided into three groups with different concentrations(low?mediate and high), into the fodder of the infected swarms.It showed that the number of infected larvae which were fed with HT115-dsRdRp in mediate and high concentration was remarkably less than the control group.Other two figures were made out, which showed the effect of dsRdRp on the number of sealed brood and the population of a colony respectively.So we used specific primers(EcoR1-F/Pst1-R) to synthesize T7 RNAP gene by PCR.As usual, pinking the positive colonies, PCR and sequencing.Next, we would continue to collect more data until we draw the scientific conclusion.With the development of our project, we gradually have realized that even if using yeast can solve the problem of biosecurity, there are still other troubles, such as less expression of dsRdRp in yeast, easier to loss plasmids in yeast and harder to digest the cytoderm of yeast for Chinese honeybees.So we need a better plan to deal with these to make a more practical production.After AGE, it showed that the CSBV-carried rate of first and second filial generation was 30% and 20% respectively, which was obviously declined.We detected the expression quantity of CSBV in offspring by RT-qPCR.That was what we would consider deeply in future work.Today we decided to constract RdRp-pSB1C3 again, because we thought T7 RNAP-pSB1C3 may be not a new part any more.According to the result of AGE, dsRdRp had been expressed in HT115 successfully, even though its concentration was a little bit lower.Next few days we would detect the expression quantity of CSBV in offspring.We made the figure of the effect of dsRdRp on the number of sac-like larvae.Then after 12h, we fed them another fodder with CSBV extracting solution.Then we began to link RdRp with L4440 and pSB1C3 using T4 ligase, 4?, overnight.We did transformation.And T7 RNAP gene was amplified by PCR(EcoR1-F/Xho1-R).Today we used IPTG, which was divided into two groups with different concentrations(0.4mmol/ml?0.8mmol/ml), to induce the expression of dsRdRp in HT115 for 5h.So the transformation of RdRp-pSB1C3 could only be done tomorrow.Today there was two news.)We got the preliminary result of index of swarms.So far, we got the target fragments successfully.Firstly, we extracted the whole RNA of CSBV by Trizol.We had to change T4 into a faster ligase..As predicted, there was still nothing on the plate.We did transformation again.The second sequencing was completely failed because the sequencing company could not get any plasmid.Then we collected the bacteria to extract dsRdRp by CTAB.Eventually,we got the matching sample after using KD Plus.So we want to recombine another vector,T7 RNAP-pYES2.We transformed RdRp-L4440 into HT115,culturing in 37?.We found with the decreasing of CSBV.We stored them in -20?.Today we went to observe the condition of swarms, and it was happy to see that the experimental groups turned to a healthier development comparing

we find that the production of GFP protein is quite high even though at 0.02% galactose and with the increase of its concentration, the level of GFP have no remarkable change.1.The galactose at three different concentrations can induce GFP expression efficiently and have little influence on the level of GFP We transformed GFP-pYES2 into the yeast and let the recombinant strain grow to mid-log phase in YEPD medium containing 2% glucose.As the diagram shown, we can find that GFP production sharply increases in 10h and a peak shows up in about 24h and then it decreases gradually.We added different homologous dsRNA of CSBV (dsHelicase, dsProtease, dsRdRp and dsVP1) into forage and fed to the infected larvae.The effect of different homologous dsRNA of CSBV to the expression of CSBV\x92s

increases by about 23.68% and 30.10% after 21days.Compared with the control group, it is quite obvious that the infected larvae in medium concentration group and in high concentration group dropped dramatically by 91.44 percent and 94 87.91 percent after 14 days while the infected larvae in control group showed 65.82 percent increase after 7 days.According to the statistics we collected, infected larvae fed with dsRdRp have the highest pupation rate among all the experimental groups.In conclusion, we can find using 0.02% galactose to induce the expression of GFP in 24h is a reasonable and efficient way to get the most production of GFP protein.For the high concentration group alone, the growth of population had reached almost 60% in just 21 days.We fed the infected hives with our CSBV·Silencer, and collected the following statistics under the help of professional beekeepers from College of Bee Science.It means that we can induce the expression of T7 RNAP gene efficiently under the same condition.The number of sealed brood is another indicator of the effect of CSBV.It is an necessary stage of larval pupation.', 'safety': 'If our design works and is introduced into a

'background': '', 'description': '1 From sterilising medical equipment to producing ethylene glycol (antifreeze), and as a versatile intermediate for pharmaceutical products, ethylene oxide is essential in many products we use.2 Indeed, in 1992, the world production of ethylene oxide was about 17 x 106 metric tons, and that number has no doubt been increasing.3Traditionally, ethylene oxide has been produced through a chlorohydrin process.Our revised strategy was based on the idea that, by repressing ethene MO expression, we inhibited production of toxic epoxides, enabling robust colonies to grow, which could then better withstand producing large quantities of ethene MO when expression was induced with IPTG.We chose Pseudomonas putida for two major reasons -  If we are successful, Psuedomonas is a good intermediate host between Mycobacterium smegmatis and Escherichia coli.We hypothesised that the minimal expression in Pseudomonas was due to incorrect protein folding and thus our design sought to remedy this.We are focusing on the enzyme ethene Monooxygenase due to its ability to catalyse the ethylene to ethylene oxide reaction.Thus, the Sydney iGEM team is attempting to utilise the monooxygenase enzymes found in Mycobacterium Smegmatis to perform this reaction in a more efficient and safe manner, for a fraction of the cost.Monooxygenase enzymes are capable of performing this epoxide reaction, thus converting alkenes to epoxides safely and efficiently.During the research undertaken to develop the human practices business plan, we reflected on the toxicity of epoxides, the product of ethene MO, to the cells that produce it.This was undertaken as we hypothesised that translation was occurring too frequently, resulting in ribosomal congestion, and thus the rate of the protein s translation was not regulated correctly.Third, we optimised protein folding by adding codon-optimised GroES/GroEL chaperones to encourage correct folding.It was from this we developed our revised hypothesis: because epoxides are toxic to the cell, the enzyme s expression should be controlled to ensure optimal growth of the genetically engineered cells.7 Furthermore, a major disadvantage exists in the lower yield or selectivity of ethylene oxide and the loss of 20-25% of the ethylene to carbon dioxide and water.This repressor binds to the lac operator (within the promoter), which is upstream of ethene MO.8In a time where the demand for ethylene oxide is increasing we simply cannot afford to continue using inefficient, environmentally damaging, and expensive methods of chemical synthesis.Ethene monooxygenase is a member of the group 6 soluble di-iron monooxygenases.This process was replaced by the complete oxidation process, pioneered by Theodore Lefort in 1931.4 Since the production of ethylene oxide, chemists have successfully synthesised other epoxides including propylene oxide.In 1859 the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz first chemically synthesised ethylene oxide (also known as oxirane) from ethylene chlorohydrin and aqueous potassium hydroxide, unlocking a compound that has been extensively utilized in the pharmaceutical, medical, and manufacturing industry.This was the major modelling component of our project and more information can be found on the modelling page.Second, we optimised translation through adding weak ribosome binding sites.As our ethene MO was cloned into pBBR, it was under the control of the lac operon regulatory system.9Previous work in the Coleman Laboratory showed Pseudomonas putida can express low levels of wild-type ethene monooxygenase.During this experiment, we were unable to attain expression of the codon-optimised GroES/EL chaperonins.Consequently, the team is attempting to achieve high levels of expression in Pseudomonas Putida.Because of this, the lacI repression system was able to be adopted as a method of controlling the expression of ethene MO.Thus, the conditions must be tightly controlled to ensure maximum selectivity, making this a high-maintenance process.LacI is inhibited by addition of a compound, IPTG, thus by adding IPTG, repression of ethene MO expression is released.9 Ly MA, 2014, Evaluation of components for the heterologous expression of Mycobacterium chubuense NBB4 monoxygenases.These enzymes are characterised by the following arrangement of subunits: a coupling protein and a reductase, as well 4 subunits in (??)2 configuration.The silver catalyst is highly selective and thus ages quickly, the reaction requires incredibly pure oxygen (99% or greater), and toxic by-products such as formaldehyde are generated.Epoxides are incredibly versatile due to the addition of the oxygen atom on the tetrahedral ring making the compound strained and unstable.Escherichia coli is a more suitable host as it is easier to work with and scale up to create a commercially viable product (see here).1 American Chemistry Council, What

present oxygen-based oxidation process, whilst more efficient than the chlorohydrin process, has its downfalls.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'However, other methods instead implement secretion mechanisms, allowing a bacterium to deposit produced chemicals directly into the surrounding broth.5 This is the approach planned for MycoMimic s implementation, and thus some of the enabling technologies may already exist, particularly since we intend to achieve final expression in e. coli, which already finds extensive use in industry.It is imperative MycoMimic is closely monitored when it is scaled up to an industry level: Ethylene oxide is a highly flammable and reactive compound.Figure 5 - SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of MycoMimic.By considering our SWOT analysis (particularly the weaknesses identified), throughout project we made proactive changes to improve MycoMimic:To address the identified weakness of toxicity due to excessively high levels of protein production, we co-expressed the operon LacI which will stop the production of ethylene oxide before these levels are reached.To take advantage of the opportunity identified for governmental support, we engaged with the New South Wales state government, in return receiving funding for part of our project (see Attributions).To investigate the challenges and possibilities of scaling up production of MycoMimic, we discussed what would be involved, and what this might require, with a number of our sponsoring BioTechnology firms (see Attributions).We believe this is important as it creates competition in the market, which will lead to a more diverse and fair environment.Based on lessons learned from prior implementations of bacterial synthesis procedures in industry, to bring MycoMimic into action as a substantive source of ethylene oxide we would require development of industrial plants on a large scale.This venture draws many parallels with our own, and thus serves as a case study from which we can learn.5Prior to the application of bacterial synthesis Insulin was, much like ethylene oxide, produced by an inefficient and environmentally degrading method.Consequently the ring can be easily opened up, releasing abundant amounts of energy that can be used in further reactions, such as nucleophilic addition, hydrolysis, and reduction.Over time the production processes for ethylene oxide have evolved, incrementally improving efficiency and reducing waste.3 This has demonstrated a chemical industry happy and willing to embrace change to improve their environmental impact, even if on occasion it is to the detriment of their bottom line.Studying these problems from a business perspective provided influential insight into our iGEM project, and indeed the entire concept of our project is a direct result of the volatile, finite, and environmentally damaging methods of ethylene oxide production that are ubiquitous at present.Due to the abundant use and versatility of ethylene oxide it is evident this compound is at present essential to our society: Thus, it is imperative we find a new avenue for production of this critical substance in an environmentally friendly and cost efficient manner.Thus, we believe that if we can develop an economically-feasible product we will be able to make a strong case for its replacement of contemporary processes.In Figure 2 the advantages and disadvantages of current methods of production are compared: Based on the numerous disadvantages of the complete oxidation process, which we believe far outweigh the advantages, it is evident a new, clean, green process needs to be created and implemented on an industrial scale.However, at present the production method of ethylene oxide is environmentally detrimental, expensive, and uses non-renewable resources as its reagents.1 A major focus of governments, industries, companies, and universities over the last few decades has been the creation of a more sustainable future.By sharing details of our business plans, particularly how they can lessen the environmental impact of industrial processes, we were able to garner considerable interest, and help to allay common (but often misinformed) fears held by the public.By identifying opportunities for expansion of our methodology to biological synthesis of other chemicals, our business plan played an important part in motivating our modelling research: Since many hurdles will need to be overcome with each synthesis pathway developed in the future, we designed adaptable tools for codon optimisation.Bacterial production of ethylene oxide is a significantly better alternative to traditional chemical synthesis.Ethylene oxide, one of the most abundantly produced chemical compounds, is derived from ethylene via an oxidation process.As outlined, MycoMimic has the potential to be an incredibly effective, versatile, and necessary product in a time when the world is striving to improve environmentally sustainability.Therefore, perhaps the greatest risk facing MycoMimic is a failure to become economically viable: If we cannot demonstrate a process which at least has the potential to be economically scaled up, it will be all but impossible for our new technology to be implemented on any meaningful scale.The only requirements for this product are the bacteria MycoMimic itself and a source of ethylene.Secondly, the reduced barrier-to-entry and comparative ease of production provided by MycoMimic creates a more accessible market, preventing monopolies from forming in which the control of this important compound might fall into the hands of a few.Encouraged by these discussions we set expression in e. coli as the eventual aim of our project, since this is the most common and effective host for production on industrial scales.As public concern and opposition plays a major part in all Synthetic Biological ventures, we were able to tailor our approach to Human Practices to address this.In addition, through our research, we discovered that the amount of ethylene oxide a single cell had to produce in order to be a more efficient alternative than the current method of production would be toxic to the cell.Consequently, in a time where the demand for ethylene oxide is increasing we simply cannot afford to continue using inefficient, environmentally damaging, and expensive methods of chemical synthesis.Image from 5Though MycoMimic hopes to break new ground in industrial synthesis, the application of bacteria for large-volume chemical synthesis of chemicals is not without precedent: One of the early breakthroughs in this field came in the development of an e. coli strain able to produce Insulin.Many aspects of our project were motivated by consideration from a business perspective, which revealed the range of interlinked challenges faced in the implementation of synthetic biological technologies.Moving forwards after MycoMimic, much of our work has been completed with the necessity for future industry implementation in mind: by developing adaptive tools and methodologies, and by improving public understanding of these technologies, we hope that we have helped to invigorate a market more receptive to synthetic biological solutions to everyday problems.Our project has a very viable "real world application", and thus we created a Business Model and plan for the transition from laboratory experiment to a feasible product.Similar safety checkpoints will be necessary in any ethylene oxide synthesis process: Via their inclusion the risk of any physical threats (such as explosion of synthesised products) can be monitored, and financial and time costs due to errors in production may be minimised.Furthermore, in the case of ethylene oxide competition can also arise in the form of new methods for production, such as that current used for crude oil.Figure 2 - The advantage and disadvantages of production of ethylene oxide through the complete oxidation process.Without the means to break through the cellular membrane the Insulin accumulates inside the body of each bacterium, and thus maximal production is reached within the span of a few hours.Its aim was to demonstrate the capacity and the MycoMimic project has to be applied to the real world and developed into a working product.Aside from the core industrial processes involved, many aspects of bacterial Insulin production may provide important lessons for our project.By continuing to promote the research and development of biological synthesis pathways we believe that even if MycoMimic does not achieve this economic feasibility, we will have taken important strides in laying the groundwork for similar technologies to be implemented in the future.Similar obstacles have plagued innumerable past ventures, which can be seen in the plethora of biological solutions to important environmental problems that are unfortunately stalled by a lack of economic feasibility.Thus we needed to create a mechanism in which the expression could be cellularly monitored and repressed when the production of ethylene oxide nears the "danger zone".Our case study serves to illustrate another major technical challenge of MycoMimic s application on an industrial scale, which is that development of the necessary logistical and regulatory framework can provide a substantial challenge outside of the biological context.It is therefore necessary to firstly establish the different views on this issue held throughout the community, and secondly to explain or market the product so that the consumers understand the benefits of MycoMimic, both to themselves and the environment.Furthermore, numerous environmental and sustainability organisations, including the United Nations Environmental Program, have highlighted the need for greener and more sustainable alternative procedures for production of common chemical compounds.We believe that the product developed in our project can significantly assist in decreasing carbon emissions and in creating a more sustainable future for all.With each such venture new research spotlights and studies the financial barriers in this field, and as we incrementally push these forwards we will see greater numbers of possibilities for the implementation of synthetic biology in industry emerge.Typically, synthesis is performed simultaneously by a large array of fermentation tanks, though the mechanisms of this process differ widely depending on the circumstance.The \x93EtnA\x94 \x93EtnB\x94, \x93EtnC\x94, and \x93EtnD\x94 are the four subunits of the enzyme.Given MycoMimic is an easy product to work with, it can be used on both large and small scales.With the insertion and successful expression of this enzyme, the bacterium can produce ethylene oxide.The world production of ethylene oxide is (17\times10^6) metric tons2 and will only increase on the back of the expanding economies of countries such as China and India.Once this reaches maximal capacity it is time to begin production, which is kick-started by the addition of an inducer to the broth.Though other processes have pioneered the implementation of genetically modified organisms for industrial synthesis, the community reaction to this pivot may present a risk.The purpose of this report is to provide an analysis of the development and commercial economic viability and likelihood of the MycoMimic product.This involved the processing of huge volumes of pig pancreases, with more than 8 tons necessary for the production of each kilogram of purified insulin.5 Due to this inefficiency researchers sought, as we do with MycoMimic, an alternative production pathway.Our project aims to produce ethylene oxide in a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and timely manner.When working with it on a small scale in the laboratory, it poses minimal and controllable threats.The processes these early pioneers developed inspired those used in our project: Antibiotic resistance is utilised to select out appropriate e. coli strains, which are then left to reproduce in an incubator over the course of some days.Thus, going forward it is essential that consumers are well informed (as we have aimed to do with our Human Practices project), such that they can make scientifically sound judgements upon these issues which play increasingly important parts in their lives.A SWOT analysis is used to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of this project.In the business implementation process these risks can include failing to manage cost restraints and changes, and can quickly balloon when unforeseen complications arise.However, in the long-term, the financial advantages of MycoMimic are greater, as too are its prospects for minimisation of environmental impact.Building upon this analysis we can proactively plan an effective strategy that will focus on the strengths of this product while catering for weaknesses and possible threats.This lead directly to the inclusion of the LacI in our project, which became one of the submitted parts.For example, it would not be entirely unexpected that objections might be raised against the idea of engineered organisms producing highly explosive compounds.In Australia, as one of the most economically prosperous nations in the Asia-Pacific region, great effort needs to be undertaken to ensure the financial aspect of the product is under control.Though the need for logistical development is a mainstay in almost all industrial synthesis, as MycoMimic departs considerably from many existing synthesis procedures this will likely provide a major challenge.In the short term, competition from oil-companies may prove to be a risk.Over the following years chemists have successfully synthesised other epoxides including propylene oxide.Data from 4Traditionally, ethylene oxide was been produced through a chlorohydrin process.This eventuated in the late 1970s, when after much research and development scientists finally demonstrated the ability to express a gene in e. coli which enabled it to produce human-viable insulin.1 United States Environmental Protection Agency, 1986, Locating and estimating air emission from sources of ethylene oxide, viewed 20th of July 2015, http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/le/ethoxy.pdf

total DNA concentration does not exceed 10 ng/µl.The introduced DNA will often contain a marker gene (usually antibiotic resistance) so that successfully transformed cells can be grown on selective

or more inserts into a vector by designing overlapping ends which can join desired DNA together after cleavage by non-palindromic restriction enzyme, BsaI, followed by ligation to seal the DNA together.Incubate tubes for 1 hour on the 37°C shakers.The restriction enzyme volume should not be more than 1/10 of the total reaction volume.Incubate for an hour at the optimal temperature for restriction enzyme activity; again, this should be checked from relevant data tables.Restriction digests with two enzymes simultaneously are also possible and were performed over the course of the

1mM ATP, 10mM DTT, pH 7.5@25°C).Resuspend cells in 4 mL TE buffer, combine resuspended pellets in one tube.If using end formers, seal the ends by pipetting a small volume of gel solution into the contact between the end formers and tank and allow to set.Spin 15 min in Centaur centrifuge (doesn\x92t need to be cold).Centrifuge the column at full speed for another 3 minutes or more to remove the residual ethanol.Place the column onto a new 1.5ml centrifuge tube.Add 1uL of appropriate purified plasmid for positive control; 2~3uL of ligation mix for test; and no DNA for negative control.Heat shock transformation uses a rapid change in temperature to cause plasmids to enter cells via pores in the membrane.Spin for 10 min, drain off supernatant, rinse pellet with 70% ethanol (as above, but using 500 µl 70% EtOH), drain excess EtOH off, then dry 10 min at 50°C.Add 8 mL lysis solution (SDS-OH), mix well by inversion and shaking(~10 sec).Resuspend the pellet in 30mL cold electroporation

discard the flow-through.Wash the column once with 0.5ml of WN Buffer by centrifuging for 30-60 seconds.Repeat solvent extractions using 500 µl chloroform:isoamyl (CI, µl) per tube, as described for PCI above.This must be added after autoclaving.Working with DNA often involves adding enzymes (polymerases, restriction enzymes, ligases), which may subsequently need to be removed before they prevent or contaminate the next stage of work.Ligation allows fragments of DNA with sticky ends to be joined together, but the enzymes also has other uses like in Gibson Assembly.In "Exponential" protocol on the electroporator, change the settings to 2500 V, 25 µF, and 200 ?.Avoid the white junk at the interface between phases.Spread-plate 100 µL of cells on LB media containing the appropriate antibiotic.Also consult the instruction booklet that comes with the Viogene kit \x96 the protocol below only gives the bare essentials required.Add 6 mL ice-cold precipitation solution (K.Ac).Ligase

'background': 'An example of a dead zone largely caused by excess reactive nitrogen is the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico which measures up to 6,000-7,000 square miles (M. Bruckner).The Haber-Bosch process is used to produce reactive nitrogen, specifically for fertilizers.There is a lot more reactive nitrogen being introduced to the environment, but the rate of denitrification has essentially stayed the same.Excess nitrogen in waterways can cause eutrophication, where algae take advantage of the excess nitrogen, causing much larger algal blooms.Our team will focus on denitrification, in an effort to restore safer nitrogen levels in waterways and bodies of water and ultimately to help make the completion of the nitrogen cycle more efficient.Our focus for this year is on the first step in the denitrification pathway, turning nitrate into nitrite.Oftentimes excess nitrogen in the soil is washed away by rain into other natural water systems.Humans have developed processes to convert unreactive atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form of nitrogen such as Ammonia or Nitrate for plants and animals (reactive nitrogen).Nitrogen is a highly abundant element in the Earth\x92s atmosphere.This nitrogen runoff can and does have devastating effects on the biodiversity in waterways.It is clear we can effectively produce reactive nitrogen, however, we need to clean up after ourselves by completing the nitrogen cycle.', 'description': 'Our project, "Knockout Nitrate", is a developing project with the aim to use synthetic biology to balance the

kill-switch mechanism to curb unwanted proliferation of our cells.We developed safety assurance cases in order to demonstrate the reliability and safety of our project.These aspects of our project served the dual benefit of improving our design by forcing us to think critically about the mechanisms and environment of our project and allowing us to connect with and respond to the public in order to educate them and respond to their concerns.These events allowed us to discuss the safety concerns that come with genetic engineering and helped us gauge the public opinion of synthetic biology.Back in Nebraska, we hosted a similar kids\x92 event at a local museum.We also held an educational event for children where we taught them about DNA, applications of GMOs, and how synthetic biology is influencing the world around us.Synthetic biology has the potential to transform agriculture and many fields beyond it, including medicine, energy, and materials and we hope that its progress will not be impeded by misinformation and unfounded levels of fear.In July, we attended the Heartland Synthetic Biology meetup hosted by Missouri University of Science and Technology.Again, we encountered the public stigma against genetic engineering, but were able to enlighten those we talked to about the beneficial applications of synthetic biology.We set up the same ""Building with Biology" benches that we used in the public event in Missouri.Together with three other teams, we co-hosted a public forum where we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of current and future applications of synthetic biology, such as drought and cold-resistant crops and mosquitoes to combat malaria and zika virus.According to the Pew Research Center, only 37% of Americans believe it is safe to consume genetically modified foods, perhaps the most prominent application of synthetic biology and it is met with even more distrust in Europe.As with most great scientific achievements, the advancement of synthetic

we settled on complementing an auxotrophic strain of E. coli with a gene that would only be expressed under high nitrate conditions.We believed this promoter could be used with a serA gene to complement a ?serA strain of E. coli that one of our advisers had previously worked with.This work led to us designing and constructing the BioBrick BBa_K2086002.Our project would ideally be able to

'description': 'For folding mechanisms, we are using heat-induced contraction of thermoplastics and the contractile properties of bacterial spores.at Columbia university, we sought to employ the contractile properties of bacterial spores to use as a folding mechanism for biOrigami.Attaching many spores to a long cellulose sheet can cause it to contract, and placing many of these sheets in parallel gives them the ability to move a large amount of weight as the water from the spores evaporates and they all contract in unison.Polystyrene is widely-used thermoplastic that is resistant to photolysis.Our Vision To create biOrigami: self-folding, biological origami for space missionsSpace exploration lies at the inquisitive core of human nature, yet high costs hinder the advancement of this frontier.We are harnessing the replicative properties of biology to create biOrigami\x97biological, self-folding origami\x97to reduce the mass, volume, and assembly time of materials needed for space missions.With heat, evaporation, and materials that could be produced in spaceBacteria can be engineered to produce thermoplastics, and some species naturally produce cellulose.Since spores are resistant to high amounts of radiation and dramatic changes in temperature, they could be suitable for use on space missions.We believe that the properties of this plastic make it attractive for manufacturing objects on long-term missions to other planets.After consulting with experts, we believe that biOrigami could be incorporated into rovers, solar sails, and more.This selective heating can be done by coloring parts of the sheet darker, so they absorb heat faster.As for the evaporation method, bacterial spores expand and contract when in the presence of different levels of relative humidity.In addition to biOrigami, we are creating a novel method to efficiently transform bacteria by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, benefitting the broader synthetic biology community.biOrigami consists of two main components: manufacturing substrates biologically and bioengineering folding mechanisms.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': 'In conclusion, our model helped us decide on the order FDC-UbiX-PAL for our combo plasmid without having to wastefully test out every combination possible.Seeing that Coenzyme A (CoA) and acetate are two precursors to our bioplastic P(3HB), we hypothesized that by adding the PanK gene, we could upregulate CoA and thus significantly increase the amount of plastic produced.In contrast, as we increased the initial concentration of CoA by a constant 0.5 mM each simulation while holding the initial concentration of acetate fixed at 1 mM, we found that the corresponding changes in final concentration of P(3HB) decreased.Clearly, we can see that FDC had a much bigger effect on the overall reaction velocity.We decided not to include UbiX in the model because we already knew that UbiX would correspond to active FDC in a 1 to 1 ratio, so we would never need more UbiX than FDC, and also because UbiX would always be right after FDC since UbiX is needed to activate FDC, our enzyme of most influence.In other words, as we increased the initial concentration of acetate by a constant 1 mM each simulation while holding initial concentration of CoA constant at 1 mM, the final concentration of P(3HB) increased each time by a constant amount.So after a certain threshold initial concentration of CoA, any additional CoA added made little to no difference on the final concentration of our plastic produced by the pathway.These results explain why we may have seen an underwhelming increase in amount of monomer produced due to the upregulation of the initial substrate CoA.Numerically simulating the model in MATLAB gave us curves that represented the species concentration as a function of time over a specified period of time.Each FDC and PAL\x92s influence on the overall reaction flux was tested by varying each of their concentrations while keeping the other constant.We plotted the time profiles of our P(3HB) for varying CoA while holding the initial concentration of acetate constant, and also the reverse, varying acetate while keeping the initial concentration of CoA constant.Detailed on the right is our set of differential equations used to represent the dynamics of the reaction pathway producing our other bioplastic P(3HB).In a similar fashion to our strategy for determining the most influential enzyme, we tried to determine the most influential substrate on the amount of produced P(3HB).These were instances where human intuition alone could not reliably answer a question that interested us, namely, which enzyme (PAL or FDC) or substrate (CoA or Acetate) exerts greater control on the flux or amount of product in our specified pathway?It is this question that we shall explore below.We wanted to create a plasmid containing our three genes of interest, PAL, UbiX, and FDC, but we didn\x92t know which order to place the genes in our plasmid.In determining whether nonspecificity lay at the root of our faulty PCR, we may resort to a read-alignment program that can computationally predict potential primer binding sites.The existence and widespread use of tools such as these illustrates the inadequacy of our minds in solving certain problems without aid as well as the consequent need for explicit quantitative models and computing machinery.In the case of our project, we used computational tools to help model the molecular dynamics of two of our biosynthetic reactions.To explain our observations, we looked towards a mathematical model.Using a similar approach to the one detailed above, we attempted to model the bioproduction of P(3HB) using the same construction as we did for styrene.Since the genes placed closer to the beginning of the operon are transcribed more than those closer to the end, we would want to place our most influential enzymes toward the promoter, and our less important enzymes toward the end.When a PCR yields unexpected results, for example, we may call upon an internal model of DNA replication in order to assess the points at which reality may have diverged from expectation: perhaps the primers bound to the template DNA non-selectively or maybe our chosen annealing temperature was too high.We shall attempt to say a few words in the defense of mathematical modeling.To the question \x93Why model?\x94, Joshua Epstein, the 2008 recipient of the NIH Director\x92s Pioneer Award, offers a simple retort: \x93You are a modeler,\x94 by which he means to say that we all are constantly running implicit models inside our head often without realizing it.We then recorded the model\x92s prediction of styrene concentration after an hour of the reaction running and compared the two enzyme\x92s influence.According to the results of our simulations, future attempts at upregulation of 3HB CoA should focus on the upregulation of the other precursor, acetate.Below is a table with our kinetic parameters taken from various kinetics databases and papers."Class I and III Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthases from Ralstonia eutropha and Allochromatium vinosum: Characterization and Substrate Specificity Studies.""Class I and III Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthases from Ralstonia Eutropha and Allochromatium Vinosum: Characterization and Substrate Specificity Studies."It was found that changing the concentration of FDC changed the rate of the reaction much more than changing PAL.This process was repeated for the varying of FDC while keeping PAL constant.In order to model our enzymatic pathway, we created a system of ordinary differential equations based on the Michaelis Menten enzyme model shown to the right.Please consider upgrading your browser, installing the appropriate plugin or switching to a Firefox or Chrome install.Experimentation makes up the backbone of any scientific discipline, and

charge of interteam communication.Flux Balance Analysis was performed by Amir, with the help of Toky and Maria.To initiate the team, we had the advice of Tristan Cerisy (PhD student, CEA).Further developments were done by all members of the team.During the development of the project, there were several people external to the team who gave advice or helped as indicated:During the brainstorming, other students were part of the team.Other members helped contacting them, as well as creating the crowdfunding campaign.The acquisition of lab material was coordinated by Mounia, Charlotte and Cécile.Treasury and funding administration was hold by Vincent and Toky, supervised by Cécile.Team task management was coordinated by Maria, with the advice of Alba and Cécile.The logo, Wiki and documents were designed by Jean.Human Practices were developed by Taman with the help of the team.The Evry iGEM Team 2016 was created by students enrolled in the M2 Systems and Synthetic Biology (mSSB), during the very first months of lessons.In late March, and after several project discussions, the "Let s PLAy" idea was presented to researchers on the Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (iSSB) in Evry, and was finally chosen.For modeling the Dynamic regulation with Kappa, we had the collaboration of Adrien Blasso-Blandin (Postdoc, ENS Lyon - HMS).All the iSSB researchers were prone to help: PhD students, research internals, employees and professors.iSSB: All the experiment performance was possible thanks to the space given in iSSB and Absynth lab, managed by François Képès (iSSB director) and Joan Hérisson.In the procedure of choosing adequate plasmids for P. putida, we had the advice of Victor de Lorenzo (PI, CNB-CSIC).Université d Évry-Val-d Essonne: We were allowed to use facilities of the university campus, directed by Patrick Curmi, and its related associations coordinated by Sylvain Fisson.Toky and Jonathan participated on the design.Finally, we would like to thank our team supervisors, Andrew Tolonen and Bruno Colombo; our cheering committee, leaded by comandante Shawez; the Ulule contributors; our classmates and our families, for all the support they provided during these months.For engagement, we were facilitated to do presentations to high school students by Laurent Martorell and Céline Barreto, teachers of Langevin-Wallon high school.For human practices, we had several helpers, referred in the Integrated Practices page.Zaahith Abdoulatif (L3 Life Sciences) defended our project in front of the subvention CROUS commission.None of the research lines of iSSB were dedicated to polymer bioproduction.For the MOOC, we went to record at the Maison des Initiatives étudiantes.By getting motivation and advices from ex-iGEMers, the team quickly started doing weekly Journal Clubs - to speak about science and share synthetic biology knowledge.The survey was conceived by Taman, along with Yanis Khenniche (L3 Life Sciences) and Vincent, data were processed by Jean.From that point on, we kept designing the project and the real wet-lab work started at the beginning of July.Cloning experiments for E. coli were performed by Charlotte, Delphine, Jonathan, Mounia, supervised by Cécile.On January, the Brainstorming session started, organized solely by the students.Experiments for collaboration with Paris-Bettencourt were performed by Robert while being supervised by Cécile.Video edition was performed by Jean, and content was also defined by Robert and Maria.For filling the wiki, we received advice from François Bucchini (Research assistant, iSSB).Génopole: The major part of financial support came from Génopole biocluster, with the approval of Emmanuel Dequier.Along the project design, Mauro Moreno (M2 mSSB), Manu Gimenez (M2 mSSB), Rebecca Sciauvaud (L3 Life Sciences) and Sarah Piet (L3 Life Sciences) contributed with their ideas.', 'background': '', 'description': 'Working with engineered bacteria involves important safety issues that we considered in the design of our project.The Polylactic acid (PLA) produced by Pseudomonas putida that we want to manufacture is designed to be use in everybody s daily life, and also in different application such as drug delivery, so it is key that we detail its biosafety to reassure this usability.We used coding for Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase, this part is necessary for the polymerization of the lactyl-CoA into PLA.The PLA can be reused if it undergoes a special treatment, different from the one performed for common plastics.In order to reduce these two main risks, a sensitivization campaign on the correct way to throw away PLA waste should be prepared and spread with the items produced with our PLA and during events involving public audience.This enzyme catalyzes the polymerization of the lactyl-CoA into PLA and it has no virulence factor, which makes it safe.If released in the environment, our engineered bacteria won t be able to produce PLA due to the fact that the PLA producing operon is under control of an IPTG inducible promoter.Choosing Pseudomonas putida as chassis has multiple advantages; not only for its ability to produce lactate and making good polymerization but also because it is a versatile saprophytic soil bacterium that has been certified as a biosafety host for the cloning of foreign genes.Pseudomonas putida KT2440 belongs to the risk group 1 of the non-pathogenic organisms.Thus, it would be important to avoid the accumulation of PLA waste in the environment.Another main risk would be the "contamination" of the recycling trashes with PLA waste.Moreover, our strain, KT2440, is the first Gram-negative soil bacterium to be certified as a safe strain by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and is the preferred host for cloning and gene expression in Gram-negative soil bacteria.Indeed, in France, recycling waste has a great importance but people are often not enough aware of the different type of waste and could easily throw away the PLA articles with the other plastics.Other risks linked to our project context, would be the dissemination of the PLA product waste into the environment.This part catalyzes the transformation of lactate into lactyl-CoA (necessary for the synthesis of PLA).Pseudomonas sp.MBEL 6-19 NA (the risk group is not indicated in [3]).We used the gene coding for the Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase.', 'design': 'In order to do so, we took a series of steps that helped us decompose and achieve the task: Optimization through DIY bioprocess design (Improvements) Analysing each of the steps individually allowed us to go into further detail on the theoretical conception of our project.In our project, we aimed to apply these design principles to solve our PLA bioproduction problem.', 'human_practice': 'During this year s edition of iGEM, the team Évry has had the opportunity to co-organize a big European meet-up, with iGEM IONIS, and to attend to a regional Ile-de-France meet-up celebrated in Paris, organized by iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Paris Saclay.On the 2nd and 3rd of July, our iGEM team coorganized the European Experience with iGEM IONIS team.This fantastic meeting was performed at the Pasteur Institute and organized by iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Paris Saclay.Demonstration of a Drone was performed and garden picnic allowed to tighten the link between iGEMers in the Parisian area.All the teams were able to present their projecs, as well as share ideas and explore new possibilities for collaborations.', 'modeling': 'We have performed an extended pathway analysis and we have studiedpossible feedback regulation systems, bringing a new approach on genetic circuitry to iGEM community.The extension of pathway analysis consisted on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA).We have conceived a feedback system depending on a lactate biosensor and inhibition of promoters, as explained in Dynamic Regulation.We have modified a published SBML model of P. putida KT2440 to include our PLA production reactions and, by using OptFlux software, we have performed the analysis shown in Flux Balance Analysis.By studying these fluxes, we can predict the effect of genetic modifications - genes knock out or overexpressions - or the variations that initial carbon source can bring and optimize the system.In order to model it, we have applied two different approaches: rule based modeling based on Kappa language (Kappa model) and equations implemented on a genetic circuit (Circuit).In nature there are biological feedback processes that provide dynamic regulation.', 'notebook':

'background': '', 'description': 'The ability to modulate production between the expression of XO alone or XO with BADH gives us a specificity that is not contained within any one current manufacturing method today.Table 1: Summary of values of precursors, intermediates, and aldehydes that will be investigated.The soil microbe Pseudomonas putida is known to break down multiple toluene derivatives through a well-characterized metabolism [5].Further investigation of BADH with corresponding alcohol intermediates for these substrates is described below.Figure 7: Successful production of corresponding alcohols and aldehydes for toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene.Figure 8: Extent of conversion of toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene to either alcohol or aldehyde.As shown in Figure 8, XO was not shown to be active as expected from literature [7] for 3-chlorotoluene, m-anisaldehyde, and p-anisaldehyde.The Pu promoter of P. putida is activated in response to the presence of toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene when the activator protein xylR is also present in conjunction with IHF and RNAP Ï\x8354 (both of which are naturally found in E. coli) [16].Xylene monooxygenase is one of many oxygenases reported in literature to have the activity described below, and produces indigo at a significant titer.Along with its oxygenase activity on methyl groups, XO can act on naturally generated indole from E. coli and synthesize indigo dye with the mechanism shown below in Figure 14.Figure 13: Aldehyde production from alcohol substrates  Though it was not shown that P. putida BADH was able to produce p-anisaldehyde, the iGEM team was still able to identify two previously unknown activates of the enzyme.One of the largest byproducts of this industry is a mixture of toluene and its derivatives, and as a result roughly 21 million tons of toluene alone are produced each year [2].We chose the complex chemical mixtures of gasoline and simulated BTX (toluene and the three xylene isomers) to serve as stand-ins, as they would provide complex substrates from which to measure the concentration of our terminal products, benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde.However, it is demonstrated in Figure 22 below that in the simulated BTX mixture benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol are both generated from toluene.The genes XylA, XylM, and XylB from the P. putida TOL pathway were successfully integrated into E. coli to form a system for bioremediation of and manufacturing using toluene derivatives.E. coli Platform: A Novel Approach for Synthesis of Aromatic Aldehydes  Our group engineered the genes xylA, xylB, and xylM into Escherichia coli, and the modified organism now functions as the biocatalyst for aromatic aldehyde synthesis.BBa_K1966001 contains xylB, the P. putida benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (BADH).Though BADH has been previously demonstrated to be functional with benzyl alcohol, 3-methylbenzyl alcohol, and 4-methylbenzyl alcohol [5], it has not been tested with the alcohol products that were originally expected from XO: 3-chlorobenzyl alcohol, 3-methoxybenzyl alcohol, and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol.E. coli was selected as an expression host because it is a well understood model organism, and it has been previously indicated in literature that aspects of our platform are functional in this host [7].The constructs listed below were all submitted by the UKT iGEM team for this year s project.Industrial aromatic aldehyde synthesis takes advantage of the low price and high availability of toluene derivatives as a substrate for production.The chromatogram in Figure 22 shows only toluene, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde as o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene cannot be reasonably differentiated with available GC-MS methods, so chromatograms for these compounds would be inconclusive.BADH s activity on substrates with both halogen and methoxy functional groups shows that it is a reasonably wide substrate-range enzyme and is a suitable choice for generation of a library of aromatic aldehydes from aromatic alcohols.The final aspect of our product is indigo production.Although little benzaldehyde was produced, a significant amount of toluene was converted to the more environmentally friendly benzyl alcohol.It is likely that at a higher gasoline concentration more benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde would be detected, but because toluene was only present at approximately 0.25%v/v in the culture substrate availability is limited.It has been previously explained in literature that though xylene monooxygenase can act on these substrates [7] it does so with far lower specificity than to its primary targets (toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene).Toluene s corresponding aldehyde product benzaldehyde is used as the most common source of almond flavoring and fragrance across the globe, and is therefore much more valuable than toluene.This compound was chosen more to show novel functions of P. putida BADH than for its practical application; this is the first ever demonstration that the enzyme acts upon halogenated toluene derivatives.Figure 18: Regulation of the P. putida Pu promoter.Figure 19: Constructed and proposed constructs for Pu promoter-regulated expression.When constructed as in part BBa_K196600x and grown with IPTG to induce the lac promoter, the Pu promoter is intended to sense and respond to toluene derivative substrates in media and subsequently express genes for their remediation.Because XO is sterically prevented from acting upon toluene derivatives with functional groups in the ortho position, we have only investigated m-xylene and p-xylene here.We hypothesize that the BADH promotes the conversion of indoxyl to 3-indoxole, which is necessary to produce indigo (Figure 14).In order to confirm that indigo was the compound synthesized, samples of extracted indigo in chloroform were kept and a UV-Vis spectra was checked for each (Figure 15).Spectra results indicated that indigo is in fact the compound produced.Figure 15: The spectrum on the left is the expected spectra for indigo (15, UTA chem), and spectra on the right apply to equal volume cultures grown with and without BADH as labeled.It has been demonstrated that multiple derivatives can undergo successful uptake and metabolism by P. putida and that derivatives with other groups such as halogens or carbonyls can be altered by the xylene monooxygenase [6], [7].BBa_K1966000 contains xylA and xylM, the two subunits of P. putida xylene monooxygenase (XO).This dehydrogenase is active on a wide range of aromatic alcohols, and given that indoxyl is an aromatic alcohol it likely is a substrate that BADH has specificity towards.In cases where the alcohol intermediate is more valuable than the aldehyde (notably 3-methylanisole and 3-chlorotoluene), that chemical can be produced using inly the XO module (part BBa_K1966000) instead of the composite part (BBa_K1966003) we have submitted, which will be discussed in further detail.Only the XO module has been shown in literature to function with both of these substrates, making us the first group to observe the BADH function for each.It is produced at such a large scale and in such excess worldwide that it is the cheapest of all components of BTX (Table 1).Toluene in a culture with mixed xylenes was successfully converted to benzyl alcohol and aldehyde which simulated a BTX waste stream bioremediation scenario.A simulated BTX was generated by adding a mixture of o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, and toluene at 1.25 mM each to cultures for a total of 5 mM BTX mixture.All substrates used in our experiments are of low value due to the fact that they are waste products (Table 1), but producing each aldehyde provides an increase in value of up to 25 fold.These are 2 of the 3 novel functions we have found for P. putida BADH.However, production levels with BADH under these conditions showed over 8-fold increase over XO alone; conditions designed for enhanced indigo production was 1.3-fold greater (Figure 17).Given all its potential applications, p-anisaldehyde is nearly 25 times more valuable than the respective substrate (Table 1).Toluene is the main component of BTX waste.These enzymes are both limited by an inability to act on compounds with groups in the ortho position, but other similar enzymes exist in hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria that are active for such substrates (these are similarly not active for groups in the meta and para positions).Aromatic aldehydes have a wide range of industrial uses, most prominently in the flavor and fragrance industry.Toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene were converted to their respective alcohols and aldehydes using high cell density cultures.P. putida xylene monooxygenase (XO) has been shown in literature to have a wide substrate range specificity, including all 6 substrates above (8, wide range substrate paper).Indigo dye was produced both in toluene derivative cultures, and in cultures with added indole.With this in mind, our project s goal is to construct a safe and renewable platform for synthesis of aromatic aldehydes from a cheap toluene derivative feedstock.As shown in Figure 8, toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene were all remediated at high rates.Showcasing our organism s ability to function under real-world conditions will allow for optimization of the strain and its potential application to degrading waste streams such as gasoline run-off and the production of valuable chemical intermediates.This substrate has previously been demonstrated at length, as it is the main target of the P. putida TOL pathway.Instead of the composite part BBa_K196003, part BBa_K196000 (containing only the XO module) can be used to produce the alcohol instead.P. putida uses a xylene monooxygenase consisting of two subunits, xylA and xylM, to oxidize a methyl substituent on a derivative to an alcohol group.Our platform was successful in converting the majority of toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene to their respective aldehyde products.One of the significant goals of this project is to characterize BADH for new functionality on these chemicals.Our parts are successful in converting toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene into their respective alcohols and aldehydes.Indigo production was increased when the host contained XylB.Primary Structure of Xylene Monooxygenase: Similarities to and Differences from the Alkane Hydroxylation System.Due to the fact that characterization was carried out under limited oxygen conditions to combat evaporation, we hypothesize that the combination of limited oxygen availability and low enzyme substrate specificity inhibited significant production of the desired products.Figure 21: Conversion of toluene to benzyl alcohol and trace amounts of benzaldehyde in 0.5% v/v gasoline.Another unexpected result related to indigo production was that the presence of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (BADH, BBa_K1966001) increases indigo production.Although this makes good use of the toxic precursors, the industrial processes used today present their own set of challenges, primarily that the most common catalysts are known environmental hazards themselves [4].Our part BBa_K1966004 contains all the necessary parts for regulation of the Pu promoter in E. coli.These conditions are only intended for indigo synthesis and not aromatic aldehyde or alcohol generation.The UTK iGEM team is continuing to troubleshoot the construct and registry information for the part will be updated if it is shown to be functional.Toluene from gasoline was successfully converted to benzyl alcohol which simulated a bioremediation scenario.2)Indigo extracted from cultures of BL21 DE3+XO+BADH (F) and BL21 DE3+XO (E).Part BBa_K1966003 is a composite part built from BBa_K196600 and BBa_K1966001 via digestion/ligation in the Biobrick cloning platform.In addition to the main advantage of bioremediation, this platform provides another benefit in its economic value.Characterization on 3-methyl anisole, 4-methyl anisole, and 3-chlorotoluene was attempted but unsuccessful (Figure 8).Alcohols on 5-membered aromatic rings have been shown in literature as functional substrates for XO but not with BADH.p-anisaldehyde also finds uses as a flavor and fragrance additive, which, when used either alone or with other chemicals, can create a taste or scent of flowers, aniseed, fennel, and licorice.It was not functional for 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (Figure 12).The corresponding aldehydes for the 3 and 4-methyl compounds are m and p-anisaldehyde, respectively.The most important aspect of this synthesis is that no group other than a methyl group located at the 1-prime carbon will be affected.Extractions from XO+BADH vs. XO-only are visibly more colorful, and pelleted cells are far darker (Figure 16).Figure 16: 1) Pelleted cultures of BL21 DE3+XO (A-B) vs pelleted cultures of BL21 DE3+XO+BADH (C-D).Kunz, D. and Chapman, P. Catabolism of Pseudocumene and 3-Ethyltoluene by Pseudomonas putida mt-2: Evidence for New Functions of the TOL Plasmid.Characterization of Five Genes in the Upper-Pathway Operon of TOL Plasmid pWW0 from Pseudomonas putida and Identification of Gene Products.This means that any groups at the meta or para positions of the ring remain untouched by the pathway, allowing for the generation of a robust library of aromatics.m-anisaldehyde and p-anisaldehyde have the most diverse range of applications of our target products.Part BBa_K1996004 is designed to express RFP under the same conditions.In order to prove functionality of the Pu promoter, the team first characterized its responsiveness in RFU via RFP expression levels in BBa_K1966004.The spectra above (Figure 15) also shows a significantly greater amount of indigo was present in cultures with BADH expressed.Conversion of both xylenes to their respective aromatic aldehydes generates a more valuable, more useful, and less toxic molecule.This allows us to synthesize alcohols, aldehydes, and indigo crystals all at once with the same method, yielding over 2 g/L indigo while simultaneously achieving our main project goals.It should be noted that indigo production could compete for enzyme activity and limit productivity of aldehydes and alcohols, but we do not have a method at this time of preventing competition given that indigo production will occur any time the enzymes are active and indole is present.Figure 22: Conversion of toluene in simulated BTX mixture.We used two scenarios to show real-world applications of our remediation platform: remediation of gasoline and a simulated BTX mixture.Following this, the native benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (xylB) reduces the alcohol group to an aldehyde, generating an aromatic aldehyde.Confirmed sequences of these parts are available in the registry.The concentration of gasoline was kept low due to safety concerns in the lab.Figure 12: Activity of BADH on 3 novel substrates.To show the efficacy of our approach to bioremediation, we subjected our organism to complex chemical mixtures that simulate those it would be exposed to in the field as a bioremediator and in industry as a production module.Gasoline, which contains significant amounts of toluene (5-7%, added to improve octane rating [17]), was added to cultures with BL21 DE3+BBa_K1966003 (XO+BADH) at a concentration of 5% v/v.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'The UTK iGEM team also addressed human practices by engaging the public and raising awareness of synthetic biology and our own work at a local museum, two high schools, and by hosting a GMO panel for students on campus.With a project dedicated to cleaning up wastes from the oil industry, our team\x92s human practices application primarily falls under the sustainability and environmental category.Further description of each our GMO panel, high school visits, work with local high school students in our lab, and museum event can be found below.Our goal was to guide people in our area to a better understanding of what synthetic biology is and how it affects us daily, and how it might affect us all in the future.It is well known that worldwide reliance on energy from nonrenewable sources is high, and though there is effort being put forth to reverse this, our goal is to fix problems that exists in our current largest energy global sources.However, guidelines for how to do so are not always followed or suitable, and as discussed in our project description storage and processing present a number of issues.', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'astaxanthin microfluidic lipolytica Synechocystis phenylpyruvic cinnamaldehyde encapsulation attractant photosynthetic compatibility', 'track': 'Manufacturing', 'part_favorite': '', 'part_normal': 'BBa_K1966000\nBBa_K1966001\nBBa_K1966003\nBBa_K1966004', 'theme': '464', 'hits': 0}}, {'_index': 'team_wiki', '_type': 'wiki', '_id': 'AV3_VMaVr5lUclF2BU56', '_score': 0.17353249, '_source': {'year': '2016', 'team_name': 'IISc_Bangalore', 'attribution': 'We would like to thank the students and authority of the schools,Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission, Barrackpore, West BengalDelhi Public School, Ruby Park, Kolkata, West BengalSri Sankara Senior Secondary School, Chennai, Tamil Naduwho were kind enough to let us present, and who gave their valieble feedback about our project and presentation.The lab attendants of the UG Biology labs, Sai, Reena, Amrita, and Vinod, took time out of their schedule to let us perform our experiments.Finally, we would like to thank Career Support Group -

underwent a quantum leap As stated in the introduction, our project is an attempt to modify E coli to lower capital and running costs for rDNA bioreactor systems, by automating protein over-expression induction and separation of cell from growth media.Microorganisms in bioreactors are induced at the OD, at which the protein production is maximum.Microorganisms in bioreactors are induced at the OD, at which the protein production is maximum.[5] Because of this, factories install sophisticated machinery to keep track of the OD value of the culture so as to know when to induce the production.[5] Because of this, factories install sophisticated machinery to keep track of the OD value of the culture so as to know when to induce the production.We wanted our bacteria to know when to start protein

we used the lux quorum sensing system to sense this cell density.(Figure 3) We plan to exploit this property of Ag43 to substitute centrifugation.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': 'These bioreactors

modify E. coli to lower capital and running costs for rDNA bioreactor systems, by automating protein over-expression induction and separation of cell from growth media.To learn more about the existing biotech infrastructure in India, we decided to visit some biotech parks in India and explore the feasibility and applicability of our idea.As stated in the summary, we found that the bioreactors in these parks had no sensors, centrifuges or any level of automation.It is also displayed below.We had a sit down on July 27th, 2016 with top officials at the Government of Karnataka\x92s (GoK) (the state in which our institute is located) department of Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science and Technology and presented to them our idea and its applications.We presented our project and its possible implementation in the government biotechnology parks which are lacking in machinery for automation and downstream processing, some of these processes can be performed by our BioBricks, which can effectively replace or supplement these expensive machines.The intent was to convince our government representatives of the need for enhancing the current government biotechnology facilities and a possible option of doing so.The novelty of using Ag43 for clarification of cell cultures and using this to replace or supplement energy and capital expensive centrifuges and its application in conjunction with auto-induction using quorum sensing made our idea patent worthy in their opinion and hence, to continue our research, the GoK\x92s biotechnology department granted us ~$9,000 towards consumables for our project.We found that the bioreactors in these parks had no sensors, centrifuges or any level of automation.', 'modeling': '$A_t$ -- Threshold amount of quorum sensing molecule (Adjustable parameter, by changing affinity of quorum sensing molecule for the switch) $n_f$ -- Final number of bacteria in solution (at threshold) $r$ -- Rate of production of quorum sensing molecule per bacteria (Adjustable by changing promoter)Since the bacterial is in the log phase, the number of bacteria at time $t=t$, if the initial number of bacteria was $n_i$ is, So, the rate of production of the quorum sensing molecule, if the rate of production by each bacteria is $r$ is, Rightarrow A_t = frac{rn_i2^{gt}}{g} = frac{rn_f}{g}\\ Now, expressing $n_f$ in terms of $n_i$, and taking the time to reach threshold is $t^*$, Rightarrow t^* = frac{1}{g}log_{2}frac{A_tg}{rn_i} If we modify our equation slightly to incorporate the fact that production at $t=0$ is $0$, we get, A(t, n_i) = frac{rn_i}{g} left( 2^{gt}-1 \right)\\ Rightarrow t^* = frac{1}{g}log_{2}left(frac{A_tg}{rn_i}+1\right) Considering the fact that the switch takes time $t_s$ to work, A(t^*+t_s, n_i) &= frac{rn_i}{g} left( 2^{g(t^*+t_s)}-1 \right)\\ &= frac{rn_f2^{gt_s}}{g} - frac{rn_i}{g} \text{ (because $n_f=n_i2^{gt^*}$)} The cell density after the switch turns on is $n_f $.So, To achieve initial density, $n_i$ again, the fraction to be removed is, frac{n_f -n_i}{n_f } &= frac{frac{A_tg}{r}}{frac{A_tg}{r}+n_i} + frac{n_ileft(2g^{t_s}-1\right)}{left(frac{A_tg}{r}+n_i\right)2^{gt_s}} Let us assume the cells secrete product for $t_p$ amount of time after the switch is turned on.At $k^*$, $frac{dP}{dk}=0$, but this is insufficient to say that $k^*$ is a maxima of B (just a critical point is proved).Thus to maximize product formed per unit total time (one cycle time), we just maximize its numerator P. P = pleft(frac{A_t g}{r} + n_i\right)2^{gt_s}left(C-frac{1}{g}log_{2}left(frac{A_tg}{rn_i}+1\right)\right) Defining $frac{A_t}{r}=k$, (please note that $A_t$ and $r$ are adjustable) we can write $P$ in terms of $k$, and take its derivative with respect to $k$.However, since there is only one critical point, and $frac{dP}{dk}$ at $k^*$, when $k^*>0$ is also positive, it implies that $B$ increases from $k=0$ and $k^*$ has to be a maxima.Using this result, we derive the optimal $k$ (for highest $B$), $k^*$ makes biological sense only if $gC>frac{1}{ln2}$, otherwise $k^*< 0$, but $gC$ is the number of generations of division and secretion which is expected to be much greater than $sim 1.5$ (rough value of $frac{1}{ln2}$).When $B$ is maximum, $frac{dP}{dk}=0$.Let us assume that the product is produced at a per-capita rate, $p$.So, $t_p = C - t^*$, where $C$ is the constant.It was assumed that the synthesis of autoinducer molecules is negligible before the log phase in the bacterial growth curve kicks in, and also that after protein protein production begins, the cells practically stop dividing.The constraint on $t_p$ and $t^*$ is that their sum is a constant for a given amount of media, since it basically represents the nutrient content.', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': 'The results of our experiments can be found in the following pages.', 'safety': '1)

measurement of pollutants easier, cheaper, and more accessible.Complete combustion in vehicle engines give off Carbon dioxide and water as products: $$\textrm{Fuel} + \textrm{Air} longrightarrow \textrm{CO}_2 + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{Unaffected Nitrogen}$$ However, most car engines in the developing world are not very efficient and produce carbon monoxide ($\textrm{CO}$) and oxides of nitrogen ($\textrm{NO}_x$) along with other pollutants.Our aim is to produce a portable, quick, and easy\x96to\x96use biosensor for environmental law enforcement agencies, and even consumers, that can detect for levels of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in vehicle exhausts and express corresponding chromoproteins as a result.The system is based on two separate gas\x96sensing mechanisms that work together to give a range of results: The CO\x96sensing mechanism uses the CooA transcription factor and two CooA\x96dependent promoters: CooF and CooM.The change in color caused by the chromoproteins indicate the presence of oxides of nitrogenThe second system that works for the detection of CO, consists of an activator CooA, which is normally present in an inactive form in the system and requires the presence of two molecules of CO in order to get activated.It is composed of four parts:The pCooM device produces pCooM, which is a weak promoter, with a GFP expression.The system also comprises of two promoters including pCooF and pCooM that are sensitive to the presence of CO. pCooF is a strong promoter and requires the attachment of two molecules of CO, while pCooM is a weak promoter where the attachment of eight molecules of CO is necessary in order to express the GFP.The activated (CooA)2CO complex will now bind to the promoters, the activated promoter will lead to the production of GFP, that has the tendency to indicate that CO is present in the system.We used two different chromoproteins in our system.Our biosensor, on the other hand, will be cheap, easy\x96to\x96use, and highly portable.The project centers around a biosensor with two detection systems: one system for the detection of CO, and the other for detection of oxides of nitrogen, particularly, NO and NO$_2$.The parts are:The pCooF device codes for the strong promoter which senses the presence of CO, and then expresses GFP.The parts includes:The PyeaR device code for PYeaR promoter, which when interacts with oxides of nitrogen produces GFP.Usually a repressor in a cell is attached to two promoters; pYeaR and pNirK , when the cell is surrounded by NOx , molecules of NOx get attached to the repressor, relieving the two promoters which further transcribe a gene responsible for yellow chromoprotein.When both of the gases CO and NOx are present, the cell will transcribe both blue and yellow chromoproteins giving off a color in a shade of green.They have been linked to the deaths of 23500 patients in UK each year.The methods used for measuring gaseous concentration are Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) and Gas Chromatography (GC) for carbon monoxide, and Gas Phase Chemiluminescence for nitrogen oxides.It is composed of four parts:The PNirK device is used for the GFP expression.The total number of motor vehicles in Karachi is a staggering 1.82 million, with 16,000 new ones hitting the road every month.Although laws and regulations regarding vehicle emissions exist, the World Bank s Cleaning Pakistan s Air report points out implementation as a major problem.When CO is present in the system, two molecules of CO will bind to the inactive activator, thus making it active.The devices includes:The CooA device comprises of four parts and is responsible for the production of CooA activator protein.It uses four parts:NsrR device is composed of four parts and is responsible for the production of NsrR repressor protein.When there is CO present outside the cell, the CO device gets activated and gives off blue color.Oxides of nitrogen bind to the NsrR repressor which, depending on the concentration of nitrogen oxides, activates either the YeaR promoter, or both the Year promoter and Nirk promoter.The situation is worse for developing countries where air quality levels of 98% of cities exceed WHO limits.A World Bank report released in 2014 states that the consequences of air pollution suffered by Pakistan are the highest in South Asia; air pollution is responsible for more deaths than other high\x96profile causes of mortality in this country.The NOx\x96sensing mechanism uses the NsrR repressed promoters, YeaR and NirK, as well as the NorV promoter.The continuous deterioration of air quality, especially in urban areas, is a matter of global concern.$$\textrm{Fuel} + \textrm{Air} longrightarrow \textrm{CO}_2 + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{Unburned Hydrocarbons} + \textrm{CO} + \textrm{NO}_x$$Carbon monoxide is a partially oxidized product of combustion reaction.On the other hand, if NOx is present outside the cell, the NOx device in the engineered cell gets activated.With more than 10.6 million vehicles on the road, Pakistani cities of Karachi, Peshawar, and Rawalpindi are among the 20 most polluted cities in the world.It is formed when the hydrocarbon fuel is not completely oxidized to carbon dioxide.This activation of promoters results in the expression of their respective chromoproteins.', 'design': 'But don t opt for a complete redesign because \x97 in all likelihood \x97 it would turn out to be a bite too big to chew.CSS code to make the iGEM s right-side menus and other annoyances disappearOnce you have made your offline website, you will then paste its HTML code on your team s page, and link the CSS and JavaScript files (which you would also have to upload to iGEM).For example, they place all fonts in a fonts folder, and images in an img folder, and then use relative paths in the code to access these assets in their CSS or HTML code.When designing an iGEM wiki, you must not use local resources.After you are done developing the wiki, all you need to do to make your "offline" wiki "online" is to just copy and paste your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code on your iGEM Team pages.We then dumped all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at the very last hour on to the iGEM server.But you must take care of a few things if you want to follow this approach:Usually, when web developers develop websites locally \x97 i.e., offline \x97 they use all assets locally.You will quickly find it out using the Statcounter s analytics because none of your visitors will be opening this Notebook page, and it won t get registered in the Statcounter logs.Using StatCounter you can get useful statistics on your wiki visitors: You can view their IP addresses, the browser they were using, their screen resolution and operating system, the pages they visited, and how long they remained on any particular page.Instead, you should make separate HTML files for these reusable elements of the website, and then use the .kit language to import them in your pages as needed \x97 super convenient if you ask me.Instead make your wiki locally first just like a normal website, and then copy and paste the HTML and CSS code on your team s iGEM pages.You can use the girdlover tool to choose the size of your h and p elements that follow the Golden ratio.Once you design you wiki, you would want to know how many visitors are visiting your website, and how much time they are spending on any particular page.By adding StatCounter s tracking code, you can track not only how many visitors are visiting your wiki each day, but you can also get the finer details, such as their country, their browser and operating system, their screen resolution, the referring link, the view time, and duration.A wiki using them will be slower than the one using Neat, which is a minimalistic and light weight framework \x97 all the more reasons to start using Neat in your next wiki or web design project.iGEM provides a very basic editor to edit your Team s wiki pages, but using it is a real pain.Instead, you should first upload them to iGEM servers, and then use the absolute path of these assets in your CSS or HTML.Use Allow CORS and Cache Killer Chrome extensions during developmentWhen you are working on a local website which is using online assets, the assets will fail to load in your web-browser.Don t expect someone with a biology background and zero programming experience to be able to redesign the wiki.In case you happen to end up in a team in which no one has any programming or web development experience, then it s probably better that you stick with default iGEM wiki template and tinker with its styling to improve it or customize to your taste.For first timers, completely redesigning the wiki could be an overwhelmingly difficult experience, partly due to the scant information available on how to do it exactly.Here, we present some of the lessons we learned while completely redesigning our iGEM wiki for the first time in the hope that some teams in the coming years will find it useful.A responsive wiki adjusts its content to different screen-sizes by tweaking its layout so that the main content is always visible clearly without the user needing to zoom-in or scroll horizontally.A responsive website adjusts its layout according to the size of the device it is being viewed on.Searching responsive menus on CodePen churns out a whole catalog of menus that you could choose from and use in your wiki.Do you want a cool menu in your wiki?Use the Cache Killer Chrome extensionto purge the cache every time you refresh your webpage.Use Live Reload to automatically refresh the webpage you are currently developingEvery time you make changes in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, you will need to save these changes and then refresh your webpage to view the changes take effect.Either use Codekit s Preview feature or use Live Reload software to refresh the webpage automatically whenever you make any changes in your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.The smaller the size, the faster the webpage will load.Moreover, combine all your CSS files into single CSS file, and all your JavaScript files (except MathJax.js) into a single JavaScript file.There are three major grid frameworks you could choose from:If you use Bootstrap or Foundation, you will litter your HTML markup with presentation classes from these frameworks, which is not a good practice; the content should always be separate from its presentation.But you will find that the iGEM right-side menu will be still there, and your layout will be all messed up.We went through this and spent a fair amount of time solving it.Although iGEM provides a basic skeleton for the wiki \x97 that can be easily filled by anyone who has some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS \x97 most teams prefer to completely redesign the look and feel of their wiki.Once you ve done that, include the consolidated CSS and JavaScript files in your Wiki pages.For example, _header.kit file contains HTML code for the header section of our wiki pages and we are importing the contents of this file in the code above.For screen widths above 1000px, the iGEM wiki lays out the menu vertically as a sidebar.Don t use relative paths of your assets when developing your iGEM wiki offline.Always used absolute paths of your assets when developing your iGEM wiki offline.Example of use of relative path of assets.You can then use these fonts on your wiki as well.FontFaceNinja could be used to identify fonts on any element of a webpage.Off course, you would have to do a few minors tweaks to link your CSS and JavaScript files, but no major changes would be needed.One of the easiest way to find it out is to use the FontFaceNinja extension in Chrome to identify the fonts used on different elements of a websites.Developing a killer wiki would need skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Sass.You won t need to use any presentation classes in your HTML markup if you use the Neat grid framework.Codekit will compile the files for you so that the separate snippets are included inline in the final HTML output.Just add the following code at the top of your CSS to make all the annoyances disappear.In the above illustration of our responsive wiki, the picture and bio get re-arranged depending on the size of the window.In a responsive web design, the website tweaks its layout for different screen sizes for best user experience.Single CSS and JavaScript files will require single http requests; the smaller the number of http requests, the faster the website is going to load.HTML now contains only the page s content.You must also take care of the font size, line height, and measure of your text so that everything is easily readable and looks nice at the same time.We have combined all our individual CSS files (shown on the right) into a single minified CSS file (main.css) using CodeKit.Live Reload can work on both Windows and Mac whereas, Codekit is a Mac-only software.While developing your website locally, use .kit language to reuse your code snippet across many different pages.Similarly, _all_in_one_footer.kit file contains HTML code for the footer of the website.Your custom\x96designed wiki can have as many breakpoint as you like, but we think that a single breakpoint, around 1000px, is enough.The default iGEM wiki template for the year 2016 uses a breakpoint of 1000px.You don t have to reinvent the wheel.Typography plays a key role in the look and feel of a website.All this information can provide you with valuable insights that you can then use to improve your current wiki, or the one next year.You will need to enable Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) using Allow CORS Chrome extension.Furthermore, you would also need to empty your cache every time you reload a page because you made some changes in it.<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"

editor.', 'human_practice': 'We took this to our government.Our product was intended to be in the form of a strip.To counter their concerns, we designed a  killbox  plan that will be used to  sterilize  the strip after usage.The twister in the middle can help breaking the wall in between them, degrading the engineered bacteria.To promote synthetic biology in Pakistan, we wrote a detailed policy paper to the government in which we gave them short term, medium term, and long term recommendations on how to do it exactly.After a thorough response and data analysis, we figured out that the general population was quite receptive to the idea of a bacterial strip test, albeit they were still unsure if the bacteria on the strip could spread into the environment and cause problems.Our new design, incorporates a box having two sections: one section in which the strip having the engineered\x96bacteria will be placed in the nutrient media, whereas in the other section we will have bacterial\x96killers.The strip can be used several times until the media gets expired.We also wrote a policy paper for the development of the field of Synthetic Biology in Pakistan.', 'modeling': 'It can be calculated by the following equation: $$P_{exp} = frac{\textrm{number of situations in which the promoter will be activated}}{\textrm{total number of situations}} = frac{w}{z} label{4} \tag{4}$$ In our modeling of the CO-sensing system, we have assumed that at any moment only one molecule of the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ can bind to the promoter, and that the \ref{R1} reaches equilibrium before the transcription of the system begins.To develop our equations further, we say that the number of situations in which a promoter will be activated is equal to: $$ w=\textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]}=frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p} label{5} \tag{5}$$ Eq.(\ref{5}) demonstrates the relation between the binding of the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$, showing that it is equal to the amount of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ upon the dissociation constant of the binding of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ to the promoter.To simplify this equation, we assume that the number of situations in which the promoter will not be activated by $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ is equal to $1$.Note that this assumption is made because the only situation in which transcription will not take place is when there are no molecules bound to the promoter.Substituting the assumptions in Eq.$$\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]} longleftrightarrow \textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]} label{R2} \tag{R2}$$ Here, $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO.Pr]}$ represents the activated protein $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ bound to the promoter.To develop a dissociation constant of this equation, we can write as: Now, in order to get an equation which describes the change in the concentration of mRNA with time we develop the following differential equation: where, $k_{on1}$ is represents the formation rate constant of the mRNA, and $gamma_1$ represents the degradation rate constant of mRNA.In Eq.(\ref{3}), $P_{exp}$ represents the probability that the promoter will be activated by the activated activator protein complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$.The coefficient 2 represents the number of CO which bind to CooA; this number was taken from the literature.To develop a dissociation constant of this equation, we can write it as: Note that the concentrations of $\textrm{[CO]}$, $\textrm{[CooA]}$, and $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ are at equilibrium before the start of the reaction R1.The second reaction that takes place in our system is the binding of the activated activator protein complex of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ to the promoter Pr.(\ref{4}), we get: $$P_{exp} = frac{w}{z} = frac{frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}}{frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}+1} label{7} \tag{7}$$ As we want our $P_{exp}$ to be expressed in the terms of $\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$ separately instead of $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$, we repeat these above equations by taking into consideration \ref{R1} and its dissociation constant $\textrm{KI}$.$$\textrm{[CO]}+\textrm{[CooA]} longleftrightarrow \textrm{[(CooA)2CO]} label{R1} \tag{R1}$$ The equation above represents the first reaction that takes place in our system in which the CO present in the environment is taken up into the cell where it binds to the CooA protein.(\ref{5}), we get: $$ z=w+1=frac{\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}}{K_p}+1 label{6} \tag{6}$$ where, $z$ represents the total number of situations, $w$ represents the number of situations in which the promoter will be activated, and $1$ represents the number of situations in which the promoter will not be activated.Sustituting Eq.The initial condition for this equation was $\textrm{[mRNA(t=0)] = 0 molar}$.The analytical solution of this differential equation is equal to: Now that we have got the equation describing the change in concentration of mRNA, we can use the same method to derive an equation which describes the change in the concentration of the chromoprotein in time as following: $$frac{d\textrm{[CP]}}{dt} = k_{on2}.\textrm{[mRNA]}-gamma_2\textrm{[CP]} label{9} \tag{9}$$ Here, $k_{on2}$ is the formation rate constant of the chromoprotein and $gamma_2$ is the degradation rate constant of the chromoprotein.Figure 1: The central theme considered for mathematical modeling of CO system, where the chromoprotein DNA leads to the production of mRNA of chromoprotein and then subsequently of chromoprotein.(\ref{10}) is the final equation which describes the amount of $\textrm{[CP]}$ along with the amount of $\textrm{[mRNA]}$.1.(\ref{3}) it can be seen that the change in the $\textrm{[mRNA]}$ with time is equal to the difference of the formation rate of mRNA and its degradation rate.The initial conditions for the Eq.$\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$ concentrations inside the cell are constant.Table 1: Parameters, their description, and their values used in MATLAB simulation of CO-sensing system.Dissociation Constant of the binding of $\textrm{(CO2CooA)}$ to the promoter0.006 $\textrm{min}^{-1}$ / 0.0051 $\textrm{min}^{-1}$(\ref{8}) demonstrates, $P_{exp}$ depends only upon the concentration of $\textrm{[CO]}$ and $\textrm{[CooA]}$.Only one molecule of the complex $\textrm{[(CooA)2CO]}$ can be bound to the promoter at a time.4.(\ref{9}), which is: $$\textrm{[CP]} = k_{on2}.frac{k_{on1}.P_{exp}}{gamma_1.gamma_2}(1-e^{-gamma_2t}) + k_{on2}.frac{k_{on1}.P_{exp}}{gamma_1(gamma_1-gamma_2)}(e^{-gamma_2t}-e^{-gamma_1t}) label{10} \tag{10}$$ Eq.$$P_{exp} = frac{frac{\textrm{[CooA]}.frac{frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}{1+frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}}{K_p}} {1+frac{\textrm{[CooA]}.frac{frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}{1+frac{\textrm{CO}}{K_I}}}{K_p}} label{8} \tag{8}$$ As the Eq.Again, the initial conditions for this equation are assumed to be: which states that at the initial time, the amount of chromoprotein in the cell is equal to $0$.Here on forth, we will repeat the steps from Eq.', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': 'However, even while in the lab, our project does pose some risks and these are discussed below.For our chassis we are using NEB s 5\x96alpha Competent E.coli (high efficiency) cells which are a derivative of the K12 strain and not a dangerous substance or mixture according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS).Since this is a lab strain and a K12 derivative, it is non\x96pathogenic and genetically crippled to the extent that it cannot survive outside a controlled environment.All chemical reactions were and are being done in the Fume hood with complete protection including goggles.Our lab has a separate, cordoned-off area for gel electrophoresis.Our device is meant to be used to outside the lab in a real world setting, but since we are currently focused on the actual sensing circuit aspect more than the device design, we have not included any kill-switch yet (we did start designing a Kill\x96Box which is discussed below).Because the dye Ethidium Bromide is a very hazardous chemical, all gel running and handling was done while wearing gloves, lab coats and eye protection.Even if the bacteria somehow survived outside the lab, the risks are very small.The twister in the middle can help

system was used to verify the cells and it verifies that the black spots were the MC accumulated Hg2+ (Figure 8-C).The results showed that the mercury ions were adsorbed on GFP-MC protein-displayed cells by surface display system.With the increase in the concentration of Hg2+ from 0 to 100 ?M, fluorescence of GFP-MC decreased continually.This strategy was adopted for targeting the GFP-MC to the surface of E. coli.(C) EDXA measurement of the box from (D) The control TEM images of E. coli BL21.Mercury content in the Control 1 fish decreased by 62.5% compared to Control 2.As shown in Figure 8 (A) the GFP-MC was on the cell surface and was approximately 500 nm in size.Ice nucleation protein (INP) is an extrinsic membrane protein; since the truncated version of INP only contains the N-terminal domain, which is the anchor membrane and GFP-MC, the fusion protein was displayed on the surface of E. coli, without any adverse effects on cell growth and integrity.Moreover, the coexistence of other metal ions showed no obvious interference in Hg2+ assays (Figure 4-B).The concentration of mercury in the fish of Control group 1 was 0.49 µg/g, while that in control group 2 was 1.664 µg/g and in the experimental group, it was 0.623 µg/g.Figure 4:(A) Selectivity of the IC sensing system.Figure 2: (A) Fluorescence images of engineering E. coli cells.A protein band of 43 kDa, corresponding to the correct size of INP-N-GFP-MC, was detected from cells containing recombinant plasmid (Figure 1, lane 7).The calibration curve of the concentration dependence of Cu2+ showed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9846) in the concentration ranging from 0 to 20 uM (Figure 5 A-B).An outer membrane protein INP-N was fused to the GFP-MC gene, creating an INP-GFP-MC which was designated pET23b/INP-GFP-MC (Figure 1-A).The fluorescence emission spectra of GFP-MC with different Hg2+ is shown in Figure 3 (a).From the Hg2+ concentration-dependent calibration curve, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9803) in the concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 ?M was obtained (Fig.In this display system, the MC can bind mercury to iron through immobilization on the surface of cells.Comparatively, the fluorescence quenching induced by Hg2+ is weaker than Cu2+.Figure 5:(A) Fluorescence spectra of IC (OD600 = 1.3) in the presence of Cu2+ with varying concentrations.This result shows that the MC has been displayed on the cell surface of E. coli, using ice nucleation protein as an anchoring motif.Figure 6:(A) Fluorescence spectra of IC (OD600 = 1.3) in the presence of Cd2+ with varying concentrations.Thus, GFP-MC can be used for the detection of lower concentrations of Cd2+.The LMR11 samples were closely related to the LMR12 samples, whereas the LMR9 and LMR10 samples were distant from the other samples along PCoA2, which represented 24.29% of the total variations (Figure 10-B).Thus, the engineered strain can be used as a feed additive agent to alleviate heavy metal contamination of fish.In the experimental group, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were increased, compared to Control 2, while Fusobacteria and Tenericutes decreased.Fish growth was significantly influenced by the presence of 0.1 mg/l Hg2+.From the Cd2+ concentration-dependent calibration curve, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9977) in concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 ?M was obtained (Fig.In conclusion, it is important that the fodder containing the engineered strain does not affect normal growth when fed to fish.Figure 7: (A) The adsorption of Hg2+ by E. coli harboring the recombinant\xa0plasmid.The results show that the MC exhibits its mercury binding characteristics when it is displayed on the surface.This indicated that the MC can bind mercury effectively.Compared with MT displayed on the cell surface, the binding efficiency of IC is higher than MT.(C) Fluorescence titration of IC (OD = 1.3) and Cu2+ (50 µM) following the addition of different concentrations of S2- (0-50 µM).The addition of Hg2+ (100 ?M) induced a significant decline in fluorescence emission of GFP-MC, which indicated that GFP-MC can be used as a sensor for Hg2+ detection.Furthermore, these engineered E. coli cells selectively adsorbed mercury ions from LB medium containing various heavy metals separately or mixed together.To verify the surface localization of the GFP-MC protein by cell fractionation, INP-N-GFP-MC in the membrane fraction was also demonstrated by western blotting.Thirteen different phyla were identified from the 6 samples.Excitation wavelength: 488 nm (D) Fluorescence titration of IC (OD) and Cu2+ (50 µM) following the addition of different concentrations of EDTA (0-20 µM).However, it can be seen that only Cd2+ increased the fluorescence of GFP-MC (Figure 6-A).The final concentration of the ions was 50 ?M.The black bars represent the addition of an excess of the appropriate metal ion (50 µM) to a bacterial solution.A total of 15,480 reads per sample and 1,306 OTUs were obtained from the 6 samples through Illumina Miseq system for sequencing.Good\x92s coverage estimations revealed that 94% to 98% of the species were obtained in all of the samples.3-B), and the lowest detection limit was less than 1 µM.In comparison, engineered E. coli significantly protected fish from mercury toxicity.In comparison, engineered E. coli significantly protected fish from mercury toxicity.The principal coordinate analysis?PcoA?score plot revealed the bacterial communities of the samples.(B) Fluorescence responses of IC to Hg2+ at varying concentrations.Overall, the two PCoA axes explained 88.31% of the variation between the different communities.Although cells carrying pET23bNot were not fluorescent (Figure 2-B), cells carrying pET23b/INP-N-GFP-MC were brightly labeled fluorescent cells; Figure 2-A displays the fluorescence emission spectra of GFP-MC.', 'safety': 'To reduce the risks of heavy metal, we do many

idea is to create a new way to treat plastic waste by degrading it into a novel profitable transformation product and then increase efforts in plastic recycling.The challenge of the project is to combine in one system a PET degradation pathway with an optimized biosynthetic pathway: we aim to transform plastic waste into a profitable life-saving drug, erythromycin A.B. Pfeifer and H. Zhang designed a system of 4 plasmids working in the E. coli BAP 1 strain and leading to erythromycin A production with a yield of 10 mg per liter of culture media.7  PlastiCure is a well-designed biological system composed of 2 parts: degradation and synthesis.The plastic then works its way up our food chain and ends up on our plates.5PlastiCure is a biological system designed to degrade PET and use the degradation products to synthesize bio-active compounds.This will allow E. coli to express all of the necessary biodegradation and biosynthesis genes.Fig.3 - Our E. coli system is able to synthesize biologically active products and at the same time degrade plastic waste.The most common plastics are polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP).Fig.1 - Evolution of the world plastic production, in million of tons, from 1950 to 2020.1 However, the treatment of plastic is not yet suited to the exponential growth of plastic production.Therefore, PlastiCure has been thought to be derived so we can use the plastic degradation module of our system to produce a broad diversity of products.This leads to an increase in plastic in nature which pollutes our ecosystem, especially the oceans.Fig.2 - Treatment of post-consumer plastics waste in 2012, in the European Union.3The problem is worsened by the size of the plastic particles: they are mostly microparticles.In 2000, the world plastic production was about 190 million tons per year whereas today, it is roughly 300 million tons per year (Fig.1).Complete Biosynthesis of Erythromycin A and Designed Analogs Using E. coli as a Heterologous Host.This would enable us to degrade a different plastic and still synthesize Erythromycin A or to degrade PET but synthesize a different molecule.coli will be used as a heterologous host to integrate exogenous DNA sequences in multiple operons (82 % of our designed operons will be composed of heterologous genes).An analysis of European plastics production, demand and waste data7 - Haoran Zhang, Yong Wang, Jiequn Wu, Karin Skalina, and Blaine A. Pfeifer (2010).It is therefore an expensive process.6Recent advances in synthetic biology enabled erythromycin production in E. coli.Erythromycin A is synthesized by a modular Polyketide Synthase (type 1).An analysis of European plastics production, demand and waste data3 - Plastics \x96 the Facts 2014.Erythromycin also has an important role in the hemi synthesis of new active ingredients.The products of degradation, propionyl-CoA and (S)-Methylmalonyl-CoA, are used to synthesize 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6deB).Despite a very important demand, the total synthesis of erythromycin A remains a very long and complex process of about 50 stages.', 'design': 'These fragments contain the overlap of the previous cluster followed by the fifth self-recombining lox sequence and terminated by the overlapping region of the following cluster.The final assembly is framed with the BioBrick prefix and suffix, which will be used to insert the optimal operon in pSB1C3 (Figure 3).To screen the best strain, we will grow the candidates on a media that will have as sole source of carbon terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.We ordered as "gene fragment" (Eurofins-MWG) the cluster-specific lox sequence extended with the overlapping sequences.To automate the mixing of the genes we used site-specific recombination by means of the Cre/lox system, and we went a step further by identifying 5 self-recombining lox sequences (Figure 1).The strain harboring the best operon organisation will have the fastest growth and will therefore be sequenced.1 - Georgi KANTCHEV and Serena NG, Recycling

spacer region in Cre-mediated \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 recombination.The location of a gene and the gene combination are critical points for the efficiency of the system.We decided to switch from the Gibson assembly method to the Yeast assembly method, which is more accurate during replication.Homologous recombination is performed between the overlapping regions resulting after the resolution of the Holliday junction in an uncut plasmid harbouring our degradation operon.Recent drop in oil prices made it more advantageous to use virgin plastic instead of recycled plastic thus jeopardizing countries  efforts to protect the environment.1To do so we want to combine into one system an optimised polyethylene glycol (PET) degradation pathway with a biosynthetic pathway: we aim to transform plastic waste into erythromycin A.To express the degradation pathway in Escherichia coli we decided to assemble the different genes into one operon.Those molecules are the results of the cleavage of PET.Our system is composed of 15 genes, 13 of which are recombined, yielding 6 billion combinations.We assumed that the genes coding for enzymes that are close in the metabolic pathway shouldn t be too much separated.Pollution of our ecosystem by plastic waste is undoubtedly one of the major issues of the century.We added at the beginning and at the end of the cluster a non-coding nucleotide sequence for the purpose of PCR amplification of the correctly-assembled construct.The promoter as well as the terminator was put outside this combinatorial system to avoid the change of their position.The increasing production and use of plastic materials combined with the lack of interesting financial returns have just worsened the situation.By assigning 1 specific lox sequence to one cluster and placing the last self-recombining one between each cluster we are able to change the position of each gene inside it s cluster and shuffle the cluster within the operon.',

modified strain of E.coli does not leave the plant and ends up in the ecosystem.In normal conditions people would not be directly exposed to the bacteria.We also thought of the possibility of using our bacteria before the plastic ends up in the ecosystem, at recycling facilities.The plant would function as follows : the water containing micro- and macro-particles of plastic enters the plant and is put in a first container where the bacteria are located.In order to reduce the risk of leaks into the ecosystem, we would implement a filtration system.This would be the main issue with our project.At the French Meet-up in Bordeaux, the Paris_Saclay team advised us to use a compartment with two filters to be safer and to reduce the risk of contamination.We also plan to have a kill switch using an inducible promoter, so that the promoter will not function outside of our factory.We also thought about what we could do to reduce contamination risks if our projet would become real.One

even in drinking water.Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), including PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooactanesulfonic acid), are hazardous man-made chemicals produced or used in industry

showed statistics of PFCs pollution levels in every state.Hence, we assumed that fac-dex is the key to degrading PFOA.In the process breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released.Besides, tons of researches show that PFCs potentially cause diseases to animals and human.High concentration of PFCs have been detected in Pearl River and Yangtze River in China and some lakes in USA since 2007.We also insert a fluoride transporter gene, CRCB[9], to help our modified E.coli survive.There are two goals in our experiment: Degradation of PFOA and transportation of fluoride.What\x92s worse,

'design': 'Meanwhile, escaping engineered bacteria will be killed for biosafety.As for PFOA bioremediation basin, we referred to the structure of current secondary treatment basin and set up a

from leaking to the enironment, we developed a bioreactor system.We designed a bioreactor and named it \x93 PFOA bioremediation basin.\x94 Following is a sketch of our reactor.To develop a more complete bioreactor system, we plan to integrate our own device, PFOA bioremediation basin, into the current industrial wastewater treatment process in the factory producing PFOA wastewater.First, wastewater passes through RO membrane, so that PFOA in the wastewater becomes more concentrated.Once the concentration of PFOA gets higher, the efficiency of our system can be lifted.Next, after some adjustments, such as PH value and temperature, to make the wastewater a proper environment for bacteria to grow, wastewater enters our device, PFOA bioremediation basin.After being processed in PFOA bioremediation basin, wastewater is added with calcium chloride solution of high concentration, so that fluoride, which is the predicted byproduct of PFOA degradation, can be precipitated.In addition, wastewater is set to stay in the basin for a period of time to undergo PFOA degradation performed by engineered bacteria.We apply computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to predict real

expression.Second, we added different concentration of sodium fluoride (NaF) and used ELISA to detect the value of OD 600.We think that if Fluoride transporter work, the bacteria will grow better.Result: Compared with no plasmid control, we found a significant-different with 0.08M and 0.1M [NaF].Based on fluoride-concentration-time graph from sample of modified E.coli (BL21 with Fac-dex) and PFOA of 500 ppm initially, we can tell that the concentration of fluoride increases in time due to the performance of PFOA degradation.With the technic of SDS-PAGE, we can test if our plasmid can be expressed properly in E.coli or not.We separately induced 8 different E.coli culture that had be transformed the Fac-dex gene.From the growth curves, we found that PFOA has little influence on the growth of E.coli.In our experiment, after we transformed our plasmid into E.coli, we induced the expression of Fac-dex gene.After Fac-dex breaking C-F bond, fluoride will be released, leading to the increase of fluoride concentration in waterTherefore, by detecting the fluoride concentration with Fluorine Ion Selective Electrode in time, we can know the extent of PFOA degradation by Fac-dex.Then the induced E.coli was transferred into new tube containing LB with different concentration of PFOA (As below).We use same E.coli which hadn\x92t been induced as the negative control in lane 1.In conclusion, there are extra protein being expressed in the E.coli culture of lane 4, 5, 6, 7.If the gene is able to be induced, there should be a large quantity of Fac-dex existed in E.coli.We used the induced E.coli culture as our samples.BL21 with Fluoride transporter, grew better than control.Conclusion: First, the four figures show that if the environmental fluoride concentration increases, the bacteria which express fluoride transporter can growth better.It manifests that Fac-dex can successfully degrade PFOA and release fluoride.We inoculate starter culture at a 1:100 dilution into LB containing NaF with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.The result is as below?From the growth curve, we know that under 20mM of sodium fluoride, E.coli is able to grow normally.We cultured E.coli in liquid medium (3 ml LB and 5 ml E.coli broth) containing PFOA with different concentration and measured the growth curves via OD600.Under 60mM of sodium fluoride, the growth curve shifted slightly.Our maybe because the amount of our engineered bacteria added in wastewater isn t many enough to work in such amount of wastewater.We also added Mg+2 as the cofactor of Fac-dex.From the result above, the F- released by PFOA degradation is not detectable for PFOA concentration below 100(ppm), 0~12 hours.We induced E.coli culture that had be

honeybees harboring the engineered bacterium will become resistant to common field doses of imidacloprid allowing for its sustained use while reducing the risk of CCD.Gilliamella apicola is a bacterium native to the midgut of the bee.Imidacloprid is a neurotoxin that binds irreversibly to acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, eventually leading to paralysis and death.We hypothesize that a strain of honeybee intestinal bacterium can be engineered to degrade imidacloprid, a widely-used neonicotinoid.Worker bees are usually the most severely affected, and bees that leave the hive are often unable to return, eventually resulting in the slow collapse of the hive.Though the mechanisms by which CCD occurs are likely manifold and remain uncertain, neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated.This fact is supported by the lack of bee cadavers surrounding a hive, where contaminated food stores would quickly decimate a population of bees.Consequently, it is thought that the sublethal effects of imidacloprid are far more likely to lead to CCD.While the exact imidacloprid degradation pathway is unknown, an early step for degradation of neonicotinoids in vivo and in the environment involves the production of 6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA).Though 6-CNA requires a very high dose to induce acute toxicity, it still induces sublethal effects.6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA) is an intermediate in imidacloprid modification that is both toxic to bees and a persistent environmental contaminant.CCD is a phenomenon in which adult worker bees die while away from the colony, leaving behind a non-functioning colony.To potentially aid in the increased survival of honey bees from the effects of imidacloprid, our probeeotic must be capable of not only modifying imidacloprid, but also detoxifying the 6-CNA breakdown product.Our degradation pathway allows for the formation of a TCA cycle intermediate, fumaric acid, which can be utilized in central metabolism.On germination and growth, imidacloprid is taken up by the plant and deposited in many plant tissues, poisoning all pests that then feed on the plant.Death may occur as an acute effect at high doses, but this level of exposure to bees is not common in commercial agriculture.', 'design': 'First, the bee gut colonization was verified after feeding bees a sucrose-water solution supplemented with E.coli.Bee gut colonization experiments were designed to mimic the real-life situation of how the probeeotic would be delivered to the bees through a sucrose-water solution in the hive environment.The honeybees were fed varying concentrations of E. coli harboring either the degradation genes or the RFP-containing plasmid for two days to allow colonization of the bee gut.Second, experiments testing colonization of the bee gut with E.coli, harboring pesticide-degradating genes were performed.The middle and left image display the cages in which the bees were kept in.The positive results from the gut colonization experiment prompted testing resistance of bees to pesticides, such as imidacloprid and 6-chloronicitinic acid (6-CNA), after the gut is being colonized by E.coli strain capable of pesticides  degradation.Subsequently, the bees with ingested E.coli were fed sucrose-water solution supplemented with either imidacloprid, 6-CNA, or no pesticide (as control).', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': '1 = LT50), we are able to determine cumulative toxicity both without imidacloprid (thick blue line), with imidacloprid (dashed red line), and with imidacloprid and our genetically engineered Gilliamella (dashed blue line).For the generation of our cumulative toxicity graphs, we used literature values of 6-CNA decay (time constant = 10 hours), as well as known concentrations of bee gut flora (107 bacteria, of which Gilliamella makes up 12%), bee gut volume (1mm x 1mm x 1cm).We are basing our chronic exposure toxicity model on the fact that imidacloprid binds irreversibly to acetylcholine receptors in the nervous system, and as such display patterns of accumulative toxicity over time.As such, the lethal time-to-effect relationship can be expressed as LT50?DtP where:Our determination of the toxicity threshold is derived from Haber\x92s rule C x t = k whereHowever, one caveat in the use of Haber\x92s rule is in that it applies to inhalation only, but imidacloprid ingestion in A. mellifera can occur through inhalation (direct dust exposure) or oral ingestion of droplets, nectar, or pollen from treated plants.As such, we have used the toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model proposed by Rondeau et al.We then conducted sensitivity analysis, determining a) the range of the concentration of bacteria added, and b) the range of concentration of imidacloprid needed to alter bee survival time (as defined by our threshold of 1 = LT50).Dechaume Moncharmont, F.-X., Decourtye, A., Hennequet-Hantier, C., Pons, O., & Pham-Delègue, M.-H. (2003).Because of this, it has been suggested that imidacloprid toxicity depends not just on the initial ingestion, but also on secondary biological effects that accumulate over time.By incorporating the decay constants of our engineered enzymes, we were able to show that our engineered bacteria is able to slow down the accumulation of toxicity in bees.Using a cumulative toxicity model proposed by Rondeau et al., our goal was to determine whether our engineered bacteria would be able to improve survival, both at individual and population levels.Imidacloprid is a neurotoxin that acts on the central nervous system of insects by irreversibly blocking acetylcholine receptors.', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': '', 'keywords': 'osmolarity imidacloprid mosquitoes

we asked in our survey to iGEM teams which organism they chose as chassis.Thus, any alleged dissemination would be impossible.These mechanisms can be of several types, the most famous examples are the suicide genes (encoding RNAse, DNase) and/or the establishment of a nutrient dependency, where the selected nutrient does not exist in the external environment.We reviewed previous iGEM projects over the last decade and found that despite the crucial aspect of biosafety in synthetic biology and iGEM, especially for projects registered in "Environment" and "Health / Medicine" track, often no biosafety mechanism is designed, or even considered.Indeed, biological machines designed in the iGEM competition, and more generally in synthetic biology, do not exist in nature and can be randomly introduced into existing natural biomass through undesired cross interactions.This is why the scientific community is unanimous in saying that the "biosafety mechanisms" are essential and will ensure the neutralization of the living device created outside the laboratory conditions under which it was generated.Most laws, "guidelines" and associations related to the Biosafety agree in trying to prevent the spread of any living modified organism.First, we wanted to provide the iGEM community with a system able to prevent, or at least significantly reduce, the main risk: the spread of GEO.This system would include biological containment with parts that can be integrated in the genome of any Escherichia coli chassis and called SafetE.coli.This is clearly stipulated in the Cartagena protocol on Biosafety (international Convention on Biological Diversity): "The Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential Risks Posed by living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting and from modern biotechnology".Very often, the risks related to the safety of a genetically modified organism (GEO), except for a possible toxicity or pathogenicity of the organism, correspond to the spread of GEO.This reason is understandable given the complexity of the challenge of Biosafety.In this context, the 2015 iGEM Paris Saclay team decided to focus its project entirely on Biosafety.This may be due to a lack of time or resources on the part of teams preferring to focus on developing their basic idea by putting safety into the background.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '',

to bring synthetic biology/iGEM awareness to the public, the GSU-iGEM team, along with the GSU Synthetic Biology Club, developed a game that we could play with children and adults alike using Legos to demonstrate a standard, working iGEM construct.We then made competent cells using XL1-Blue e. coli cells that were grown in each type of media following the Inoue method (Inoue, 1990) and calculated the transformation efficiency for comparison.The Atlanta Science Festival Atlanta Science Festival is a week-long event dedicated to the celebration of science and technology.For the second event, we collaborated with GTech\x92s iGEM team to greet thousands of people in Centennial Park for the Exploration Expo.The overall effort of this outreach was to address the general public\x92s concerns about the risk and benefits of synthetic biology.This year the festival attracted over 45,000 peopleThis year, GSUiGEM collaborated with the Georgia Tech iGEM team for this event.As a team we wanted to reach out and show that synthetic biology is a science that is helping to improve global quality of life not endanger it.The team met hundreds of guests and unveiled our fun and educational game we called \x93BioBricks.\x94 We also answered questions about bioethics and concerns people have regarding synthetic biology.It generated lots of questions from the kids and their parents.In addition, children (and even adults) could build their own Biobrick with legos The Atlanta Science Festival consisted of over 100 events strewn across Metro Atlanta.This event brought together science lovers and the curious together to learn more about science.We explained what iGEM is and how the program is beneficial to not only undergrads, but to everyone on the planet!Both the parents and their children learned a lot with us that day!Once again, we hosted the BioBricks game and connected with people from all over the city.During the Exploration Expo, these main topics were discussed with Atlantans: What is iGEM/Synthetic Biology?I think we really helped them understand how we work in the lab better with this demonstration.This year, GSU-iGEM participated in two events to help educate the public about synthetic biology.', 'design': '', 'human_practice': '', 'modeling': '', 'notebook': '', 'protocol': '', 'result': '', 'safety': 'The team here at Georgia State pride ourselves in
